A NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE' PURPOSE AND FUNCTIONS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO
ZAMBIA.

(MLS THESIS.) EXAMINES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING NATIONAL LIBRARY
SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN AFRICA,
ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN, CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION, AGAINST THE
BACKGROUND OF DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN ZAMBIA. THE ZAMBIAN DEVELOPMENTS ARE SHOWN
TO BE INADEQUATE AND TOO UNCOORDINATED AND THE COUNTRY'S PRESENT LIBRARY
SERVICES ARE CLAIMED NOT TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ORIENTED TOWARDS MEETING NATIONAL
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPIRATIONS. A NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE IS DESIGNED WHICH
WILL (1) MEET ZAMBIA'S SPECIFIC NEEDS AND (2) CO-EXIST SMOOTHLY WITH NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

INTRODUCTION TO COMPARATIVE LIBRARIANSHIP.

A SERIES OF LECTURES ON COMPARATIVE LIBRARIANSHIP, ENTITLED THE NATURE OF
COMPARATIVE LIBRARIANSHIP; SYSTEMS THEORY IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT; DATA COLLECTION
AND ANALYSIS; SOURCES IN COMPARATIVE LIBRARIANSHIP; CASE STUDIES;
INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS; AND IN CONCLUSION. STRESSES THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF
COMPARATIVE LIBRARIANSHIP AND ITS ROLE AS A BASIC ELEMENT IN PLANNING FOR
CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENT AND IN RESEARCH. THE PRACTICE OF COMPARATIVE
LIBRARIANSHIP PROVIDES A METHOD OF DEVELOPING A LIBRARIANSHIP THEORY AND CAN
BE SAID TO BE THE END PRODUCT OF ALL OTHER BRANCHES OF LIBRARY STUDY AND ALSO
THE BEGINNING OF PURPOSEFUL APPLICATION OF ALL THAT IS LEARNT FROM THEM.
HOW CAN WE USE LIBRARY RESEARCH?.

INTRODUCTIONS TO A DEBATE HELD AT THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING IN STOCKHOLM
AUG 80. O. HARBO DISTINGUISHES 4 TYPES OF LIBRARY RESEARCH AND THEIR USES. THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL AREA, I.E. RESEARCH
INTO ACQUISITION, STORING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. THE RESULTS CAN BE
USED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON
CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED
OUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M. OKKO POINTS TO THE DANGERS OF LIBRARY
RESEARCH WHICH IS CARRIED OUT FOR ITS USEFULNESS ONLY AND IIS DIRECTED BY
OUTSIDE INTERESTS. THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST
PERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A
MISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP MUST
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEM ORIENTATED AND CRITICAL, THUS AN
INTEREST IN LIBRARY RESEARCH CAN BE BUILT UP. INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS TO  THE
DEBATE BY G. RENBORG AND E. STARFELT.
ON THE PROGRAMME FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH.

COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE LIBRARY SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON A PROGRAMME
FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH, PUBLISHED AUTUMN 80. THE REPORT SHOWS LACK OF
CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLES AND CLEAR DEFINITIONS. THUS THE TERMS LIBRARY
RESEARCH AND LIBRARY SCIENCE ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY. THE ORGANISATION OF
LIBRARY RESEARCH IS NOT DISCUSSED, AND HOW RESEARCH AT THE SCHOOL CAN BE
LINKED TO ONGOING FIELD RESEARCH IS HARDLY DEALT WITH. ORGANIZATIONAL CONTACT
WITH GOTEBORG UNIVERSITY, AS SUGGESTED, IS NOT ENOUGH, LINKS SHOULD ALSO BE
ESTABLISHED WITH OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND WITH THE CENTRE FOR
INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES. THE SUGGESTED APPOINTMENT OF A DOCUMENTALIST TO
DOCUMENT INFORMATION ON LIBRARY RESEARCH IS PRAISED. THE PROGRAMME SHOULD BE
SENT TO LIBRARIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS FOR DISCUSSION BEFORE DECISIONS
ARE MADE.
THE PROGRAMME FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH COMPLETED.

THE LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON LIBRARY RESEARCH HAS NOW COMPLETED
ITS WORK AND DRAWN UP A PROGRAMME. THE BACKGROUND TO THE WORK WAS THE REFORM
OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN 1977, WHICH ENCOURAGED RESEARCH, GIVING PRIORITY TO'
DEVELOPMENT OF FOUNDATION COURSES WHICH ENCOURAGE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE USE OF
NEW RESEARCH RESULTS, FURTHER TRAINING OF LECTURERS, AND IMPROVEMENT OF
FACILITIES FOR LECTURERS TO FOLLOW CURRENT RESEARCH. THE WORKING PARTY AT ITS
1ST MEETING IN AUG 78 ADOPTED THESE GUIDELINES' TO EXAMINE EXISTING
EDUCATIONAL PLANS TO SEE HOW FAR THEY PROMOTE STUDENT USE OF LIBRARY RESEARCH;
TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; TO PROMOTE RESEARCH SKILLS
AMONG TEACHERS OF LIBRARIANSHIP; TO INITIATE RESEARCH PROJECTS. A PERMANENT
SEMINAR FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH WAS SET UP IN 1978 AND PARTICIPANTS WERE SENT ON
COURSES AND CONFERENCES. AN EXAMINATION OF ON-GOING LIBRARY-RELEVANT RESEARCH
IN SWEDISH SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS WAS MADE  AND TO FACILITATE THE MONITORING
OF THIS RESEARCH A COMPUTER BASED INDEX' NORDIC BDI INDEX, HAS BEEN CREATED.
IT REMAINS TO PLAN A COURSE BRIDGING THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND
RESEARCHERS IN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FIELD.

LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND LIBRARY EDUCATION' A CONTINUING PROBLEM.

IT IS OFTEN SUPRISING TO ENQUIRERS TO LEARN THAT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF
SINGAPORE (LAS) HAS SO MANY QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND YET SINGAPORE HAS NO
LIBRARY SCHOOL. LIBRARY EDUCATION HAS BEEN A PERPLEXING PROBLEM THROUGH THE 25
YEARS OF EXISTENCE OF THE LAS. DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR A LIBRARY SCHOOL IN
SINGAPORE, AND TRACES THE HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY EDUCATION THROUGH
THE WORK OF THE PERSATUAN PERPUSTAKAAN MALAYSIA, AND THE LAS, RENAMED IN 1966
AS PERSATUAN PERPUSTAKAAN SINGAPURA. LOOKS FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN THE
QUESTION OF FORMAL LIBRARY EDUCATION WOULD BE REVIEWED MORE REGULARLY BY
LIBRARY AUTHORITIES.
LIBRARY EDUCATION AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATION (IN ARABIC).

THE JORDAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS SUPPLIED JORDANIAN LIBRARIES WITH TRAINED
STAFF SINCE ITS LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES BEGAN IN 1964, AND THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION CENTRE WAS LATER ESTABLISHED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS
FIELD. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY EDUCATION IS HAMPERED BY EXCESSIVE INTEREST IN
FINANCIAL CONCERNS AND LACK OF PROPER PLANNING. CONTENDS THAT' ACADEMIC
QUALIFICATIONS AND FIELD EXPERIENCE OF INSTRUCTORS SHOULD BE STANDARDISED;
INSTITUTIONS QUALIFIED TO TEACH LIBRARIANSHIP MUST BE DEFINED; THE REAL
LIBRARY NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; QUALITY MUST NOT BE
SACRIFICED TO OUTPUT OF GRADUATES; AND COORDINATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL
INSTITUTIONS AND THE JLA WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS.

ALTERNATIVE MODES FOR PROVIDING GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP IN OHIO'
FINAL REPORT.

REPORT OF RESEARCH INITIATED DUE TO THE FACT THAT ONLY 2 OHIO LIBRARY SCHOOLS
ACCREDITED BY THE ALA ARE LOCATED IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO, MERELY 35 MILES APART.
THE STUDY INCLUDES A NEEDS ASSESSMENT, A RESOURCES ASSESSMENT, AND AN ANALYSIS
OF 4 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES-A NEW PROGRAMME MODEL, A PROGRAMME TRANSFER MODEL,
AN EXTENSION MODEL, AND A CONSORTIUM MODEL. AMONGST THE CONCLUSIONS ARE THE
FOLLOWING' NORTHEASTERN OHIO WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 40% OF THE PROFESSIONAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE THROUGH 1990; A NEW GRADUATE SCHOOL WILL
NOT BE WARRANTED IN THE 1980S BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT JOB MARKET; AND TRANSFER OF
KENT'S PROGRAMME TO COLUMBUS WOULD LEAVE A SERIOUS GAP IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO.

LIBRARY TO THE RAILWAY WORKERS, WHO HAD BEGUN TO ARRIVE FROM ALL PARTS OF
SWEDEN IN 1899, BUT FROM 1905 IT WAS OPEN TO ALL. IN 1932 THE LIBRARY BECAME A
COUNCIL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE 1ST PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIAN WAS APPOINTED IN
1930. CIRCULATING LIBRARIES TO THE OUTLYING AREAS HAVE BEEN SENT OUT, OFTEN BY
UNUSUAL TRANSPORT MEANS, SINCE 1940. THE PRESENT BUILDING, WHERE THE LIBRARY
HAS BEEN HOUSED FROM 1923, WAS EXTENSIVELY ALTERED IN 1980. THE LIBRARY
CONTAINS A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF LITERATURE ON THE LAPPS AND IN LAPPISH. A
LOCAL COUNCIL MOBILE LIBRARY HAS BEEN OPERATING SINCE 1980 AND THE COUNCIL
ALSO COOPERATES IN A NORDIC MOBILE LIBRARY PROJECT WHICH COVERS THE BORDER
AREAS OF NORWAY, FINLAND AND SWEDEN. THERE ARE 2 MINE LIBRARIES, 1 SURFACE AND
UNDERGROUND. INCLUDES A STATISTICAL INSERT.
SELLING TO SURVIVE.

EDITED AND ABRIDGED VERSION OF A TALK GIVEN AT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S
BRANCH AND MOBILE LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, LYTHAM ST. ANNES, OCT-NOV
80. ALTHOUGH INCOME-GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL HELP THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE
SHORT TERM, THE RESULTANT REVENUE WILL ALWAYS BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION
OF THE BUDGET AND SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD PREJUDICE THE LIBRARY'S LONG TERM
SURVIVAL BY GIVING THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION. ONLY A MORE BUSINESS-LIKE,
PLANNED, BALANCED APPROACH THAN PREVIOUSLY PRACTISED CAN SAVE THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MARKETING CAN OFFER SUCH AN APPROACH. THE LIBRARY SHOULD TAILOR
SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY, TRAIN ITS STAFF TO BE
SALESPEOPLE, AND WORK ON PERSONAL COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC.
SEMINAR ON UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN NORWAY.

A COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED BY NORWAY'S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION TO EVALUATE

THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND PROGRESSIVE EDUCATORS: TWO POINTS OF VIEW.

A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE OF THE US PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION MOVEMENT,
1920-50, SHOWING THE AMBIVALENCE OF PROGRESSIVE EDUCATORS TOWARD THE SCHOOL
LIBRARY. SOME OF THE FOREMOST PRACTITIONERS BELIEVED THAT THE USE OF LIBRARY
RESOURCES COULD ENRICH AND EXPAND THE NATURE OF EXPERIENCE AND 'LEARNING BY
DOING'; OTHERS WERE APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT OR OPENLY HOSTILE TO THE CONCEPT OF
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY.
THE COMBINED SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARY IN OLNEY, TEXAS.

THE DEDICATION IN JUNE 79 OF A NEW CONSTRUCTED LIBRARY FACILITY IN OLNEY,
TEXAS, BROUGHT TOGETHER THE COLLECTIONS OF THE SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES,

NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCE CENTRES IN SECONDARY EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND.

(MA THESIS.) EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCE CENTRES IN SECONDARY
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND, IDENTIFYING 3 LEVELS OF PROVISION-CENTRAL, AREA, AND
SCHOOL, DEFINING THE ROLE OF EACH, THE FUNCTIONS WHICH THEY SHOULD PERFORM AND
THE SERVICES WHICH THEY SHOULD PROVIDE. DISCUSSES THE REASONS FOR THE
EMERGENCE OF RESOURCE CENTRES, NEW THEORIES IN EDUCATION, PRESSURES FOR
CURRICULUM CHANGE AND THE RESPONSE OF EDUCATION AUTHORITIES TO THESE
PRESSURES. TREATS EACH LEVEL OF RESOURCE CENTRE SEPARATELY, AND EXAMINES AREA
RESOURCE CENTRES, DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GLASGOW EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT. EXAMINES THE THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRES THROUGH THE

DEVELOPMENT, AND PUTS FORWARD REASONS FOR THE LACK OF WIDE SPREAD SUPPORT FOR
SCHOOL RESOURCE CENTRES. OUTLINES THE EMERGENCE OF NEW TYPES OF RESOURCE
CENTRES AND THE DIRECTION OF FUTURE DEVELOPM ENTS.
ON USER STUDIES AND INFORMATION NEEDS.

APART FROM INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO OTHER AREA OF
INFORMATION WHICH HAS OCCASIONED AS MUCH RESEARCH EFFORT AND WRITING AS 'USER
STUDIES'. WITHIN USER STUDIES THE INVESTIGATION OF 'INFORMATION NEEDS' HAS
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE AND NOT LITTLE CONFUSION. ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE
THE CONFUSION BY DEFINING SOME CONCEPTS, AND BY PROPOSING THE BASIS FOR A
THEORY OF THE MOTIVATIONS FOR INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR.
PORT MORESBY PUBLIC LIBRARIES: A SNAPSHOT IN TIME.

DESCRIBES SOME OF THE EFFORTS UNDERWAY AT THE PORT MORESBY PUBLIC LIBRARY, ELA
BEACH, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, AND THE WAIGANI PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY TO HELP LIBRARIANS TO KNOW THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE. A QUESTIONNAIRE
SURVEY OF LIBRARY USERS WAS CARRIED OUT BY LIBRARIANS AND STATISTICS STUDENTS
AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COLLEGE, PORT MORESBY, TO DETERMINE USERS' NATIONALITY,
SEX, AGE, EDUCATION, RESIDENCE, MODE OF TRAVEL, TIME SPENT TRAVELLING TO THE
LIBRARY, FREQUENCY OF LIBRARY VISITS, REASON FOR VISIT, AND SUGGESTIONS OF
MATERIAL FOR PURCHASE BY THE LIBRARY. RESULTS ARE TABULATED AND ANALYSED, WITH
COMMENTARY ON THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES IN THE 2
LIBRARIES.
THE CONDUCT OF USER SURVEYS.

AFTER GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT USER SURVEYS, DISCUSSES THEIR GOALS, THE VARIETY
OF SUCH SURVEYS, AND OFFERS SOME METHODOLOGICAL POINTERS ON THE CONDUCT OF
USER SURVEYS. ABOVE ALL, RESEARCHERS MUST ASK THEMSELVES WHY THEY ARE
CONDUCTING THE SURVEY, SO THAT THE SURVEY WILL BE DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT
IT HELPS RESEARCHERS TO ANSWER THEIR MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
BENEFIT ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY: THE KEY PRIORITY FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH.

BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S BOOK, DO WE REALLY NEED LIBRARIES (SEE 81/3169).
DISCUSSES 2 RECENT STUDIES IN WHICH THE QUESTION OF MONEY VALUES WAS
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED AND AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO JUDGE A LIBRARY'S PERFORMANCE
BY ASSESSING (1) HOW WELL IT WAS GETTING THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMERS AT WHOM THE
SERVICE WAS AIMED AND (2) WHAT IMPACT THE SERVICE HAD ON THOSE EXPOSED TO IT.
THE 2 ESTABLISHMENTS THUS EVALUATED WERE THE ACCESS LIBRARY OF THE GREATER
LONDON COUNCIL (UK) AND THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CENTRE AT THE BRITISH
INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT.
THE NEED FOR READING ROOMS.

IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES LIKE PAPUA NEW GUINEA, MOST PEOPLE LIVE IN RURAL AREAS
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY SUPPLY, OR STUDY FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN THEIR HOMES.
THOSE WHO HAVE SUCH FACILITIES ARE OFTEN SURROUNDED BY DISTRACTIONS AT HOME.
READING ROOMS ARE VITAL IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE PERSON
WITH NO HOME STUDY FACILITIES. THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE LIBRARY BUILDING,
BUT OUTSIDE THE MAIN LIBRARY ITSELF, AND OFTEN AFTER LIBRARY HOURS.
NATIONAL BOOK WEEK, 1980' A REPORT.

IN 1980, THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
ORGANISATION OF A NATIONAL BOOK WEEK AND COORDINATED ACTIVITIES, TO PROMOTE AN
AWARENESS OF BOOKS AND THE KNOWLEDGE AND ENJOYMENT THAT CAN BE GAINED FROM
THEM. POSTERS AND BOOKMARKS WERE PREPARED, CHILDREN'S LIBRARY HOURS WERE HELD,
AND BOOK EXHIBITIONS WERE ORGANISED. A GENERAL REPORT BY GILLIAN HOWELLS IS
FOLLOWED BY BRIEF REPORTS ON ACTIVITIES AT WAIGANI COMMUNITY SCHOOL, BY MUGEN
FOREPE; AT MT. HAGEN PUBLIC LIBRARY, BY HENRY MALU; AT MADANG, BY ELIZABETH
BOMAI; AND AT RABAUL, BY CATHERINE BASILIUS.
SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY: A CHOICE?.

REFERS TO A STUDY IN WHICH SELF-DIRECTED LEARNERS PLACED THE LIBRARY 6TH OUT
OF 7 LOCATIONS IN DESIRABILITY AS A LEARNING PLACE AND RANKED LIBRARIANS
BOTTOM OUT OF 7 CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE FROM WHOM THEY OBTAINED HELP. DISCUSSES
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE RESULTS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OFFERS SOME
THOUGHTS ON THE DIFFICULTY LIBRARIANS HAVE WITH THEIR EDUCATIONAL ROLE.
GREEN LIBRARY DEDICATION ADDRESS' THE RESEARCH LIBRARY, AN OUTPOST OF CULTURAL
CONTINUITY.

DELIVERED AT THE DEDICATION OF THE EAST WING OF THE CECIL H. GREEN LIBRARY,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, 11 APR 80. IN THE 7TH CENTURY, THE VENERABLE
BEDE COLLECTED THE MAJOR SOURCES REQUIRED FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF HIS ENTIRE
HERITAGE AND HIS OBSCURE MONASTERY AT JARROW BECAME AN OUTPOST OF CULTURAL
CONTINUITY IN AN AGE OF FEW SUCH OUTPOSTS. SUGGESTS THAT THE GREEN LIBRARY MAY
WELL BECOME 'JARROW-ON-THE-PACIFIC'. EXPANDS THE ANALOGY AND URGES THE GREEN
LIBRARY TO REPAY THE DEBT OWED TO BEDE BY BUILDING A COLLECTION FOR POSTERITY.
THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE OF BIBLIOTHERAPY AND THE ROLE OF THE JOURNAL IN
THE FIELD'S DEVELOPMENT.

PROVIDES A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE TERMINOLOGY AND THEORY OF BIBLIOTHERAPY
AND EXAMINES THE SUBSTANTIAL ROLE PLAYED BY PERIODICAL AND OTHER SERIAL
ARTICLES IN THIS FIELD. DISCUSSES SOME RELEVANT BIBLIOGRAPHIES, INDEXES AND
DISSERTATIONS, TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN SEARCHING THE
LITERATURE OF BIBLIOTHERAPY. EXPLAINS THE VALUE OF JOURNALS FOR THE
BIBLIOTHERAPY PRACTITIONER, AND MAKES A PLEA FOR BETTER BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL
IN THE FUTURE.
EVALUATION OF INFORMATION SOURCES BY EXPERTS.

NEW ITEMS ACQUIRED BY THE LIBRARY OF THE ALTAI MOTOR BUILDING COMPANY ARE
EVALUATED BY A GROUP OF EXPERTS-EACH EXPERT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVALUATION
OF A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THE NEW STOCK (DETERMINED BY THE INFORMATION
STAFF). DISCUSSES THE TERMS OF A COMPETITION ORGANISED FOR THE EXPERTS ENGAGED
IN THE EVALUATION. SUGGESTS THAT THE HELP OF THE EXPERTS WITH THE EVALUATION
OF THE STOCK MADE IT POSSIBLE TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INFORMATION
SERVICE PROVIDED.
A CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON LEIMKUHLER'S 'EXACT' FORMULATION OF THE BRADFORD LAW.

ARGUES THAT POWERFUL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH TECHNIQUES OPERATE ONLY ON A SMALL
FRACTION OF THE STATISTICAL INFORMATION USUALLY PROVIDED BY THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. USES THE ARGUMENT TO ILLUSTRATE LEIMKUHLER'S RECENT CLAIM TO HAVE
FOUND AN 'EXACT' FIT TO BRADFORD'S LAW. AN ELEMENTARY THEOREM OF SHANNON
INFORMATION THEORY SHOWS THAT HIS NEW FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO ONLY 2.3% OF THE
STATISTICAL INFORMATION INHERENT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHY HE CHOOSES AND THAT
BRADFORD'S ORIGINAL SIMPLE FORMULATION NOT ONLY FITS THIS SEGMENT BUT ALSO THE
WHOLE BIBLIOGRAPHY MORE CLOSELY THAN THE NEW FORMULATION. AS EVERY STATISTICAL
INFORMATION LOSS CAN BE MEASURED, IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT SOPHISTICATED
MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR THE INFORMATION THEY SQUANDER.
READING MATERIALS IN LARGE TYPE.

A LIST OF PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF LARGE-TYPE MATERIALS (GIVING
ADDRESSES, SUBJECT SCOPE, AND LOAN FACILITIES-MOST ARE IN THE USA, THE REST IN
WEST GERMANY) AND A LIST OF SELECTED LARGE-TYPE MATERIALS FOR REFERENCE AND
SPECIAL NEEDS (GIVING DETAILS OF DISTRIBUTOR, PRICE, AND LOAN CONDITIONS).
ALSO GIVES DETAILS OF RELEVANT BIBLIOGRAPHIES.

CONCENTRATE ON THE CHILDREN'S AND JUVENILE LITERATURE IN IMMIGRANT LANGUAGES!.

THE BASIS OF A NORWEGIAN IMMIGRATION POLICY IS LAID DOWN IN PARLIAMENTARY
STATEMENTS NUMBERS 39 OF 1973-74 AND 74 OF 1979-80. THESE EMPHASISE THAT THERE
MUST BE EQUALITY FOR ALL TO PRACTISE RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, AND SOCIAL
ACTIVITIES. LIBRARIES MUST MAKE LITERATURE AND OTHER MEDIA AVAILABLE SO THAT
IMMIGRANTS CAN MAINTAIN THEIR CULTURAL LINKS WITH THE MOTHER COUNTRY. BUT THEY
MUST ALSO MAKE MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHICH CAN FACILITATE THAT IMMIGRANTS'
ADAPTATION TO THE NEW COUNTRY AND ITS LANGUAGE AND GIVE THE MAJORITY
POPULATION INFORMATION ON THE IMMIGRANTS' BACKGROUND. THE DEICHMAN LIBRARY IN
OSLO BEGAN IN 1975 TO ACT AS A CENTRAL LIBRARY TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS REGARDS
IMMIGRANT LITERATURE. THE LIBRARY ALSO ISSUES DEPOSITS TO LIBRARIES. STRESSES
THE IMPORTANCE FOR CHILDREN OF COMPETENCE IN THE MOTHER TONGUE AND CALLS FOR A
NORDIC COOPERATION IN PRODUCTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN IMMIGRANT
LANGUAGES.
LITTLE MAGAZINES-AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

LITTLE MAGAZINES PRESENT UNIQUE PROBLEMS, DUE MAINLY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION AND THEIR UNCERTAIN LIVES. THEY ARE IMPORTANT
SOURCES OF LITERATURE, HOWEVER. AN EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO COLLECT THEM,
EARMARK FUNDS FOR CERTAIN TITLES (PERHAPS BEGINNING WITH A RETROSPECTIVE
COLLECTION), AND COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THEIR ACQUISITION.

STUDENTS; USES THE TERM 'PERIODICAL' LOOSELY TO INCLUDE NEWSPAPERS, BULLETINS,
AND NEWSLETTERS; AND COVERS AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SUBJECTS, GIVING EQUAL VALUE
TO ACADEMIC AND RECREATIONAL TITLES AND INCLUDING TRADITIONAL AREAS SUCH AS
CURRENT AFFAIRS AS WELL AS LESS CONSERVATIVE SUBJECTS SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE
LIFESTYLES AND FEMINIST ISSUES. FOR EACH PERIODICAL, GIVES TITLE, PUBLISHER,
COST, SIZE, BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS AND EDITORIAL AIMS, AND AN
INDICATION OF THE AGE RANGE FOR WHICH IT IS SUITABLE.
ALTERNATIVE AND CONVENTIONAL PERIODICALS' DEFINITIONS AND COMMUNAL ATTITUDES.

DISCUSSES THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF SOME US RURAL COMMUNES DESIGNED TO
DETERMINE ATTITUDES TOWARDS OUTSIDE LIBRARIES, AND PREFERENCES FOR POPULAR,
ALTERNATIVE OR PROFESSIONAL/TRADE PERIODICALS. PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED A DESIRE
FOR GREATER REPRESENTATION IN LIBRARIES, BUT DID EVIDENCE SOME SATISFACTION
WITH, AND USE OF, OUTSIDE LIBRARIES. CONCLUDES THAT, AS EXPECTED ALTERNATIVE
LITERATURE WAS THE MOST RELEVANT. THE VALUE OF PROFESSIONAL/TRADE MATERIAL WAS
ALSO STRESSED, BUT ONLY ONE GROUP CONSIDERED THE POPULAR CATEGORY AT ALL
RELEVANT.
NEW PRODUCTS ADVERTISEMENTS IN FOREIGN TECHNICAL PERIODICALS.

DISCUSSES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF NEW PRODUCTS ADVERTISEMENTS PUBLISHED IN
FOREIGN PERIODICALS. POINTS OUT THAT THE INFORMATION VALUE OF ADVERTISEMENTS
IS VERY HIGH BECAUSE ADVERTISEMENTS NORMALLY CONTAIN THE LATEST TECHNICAL DATA
ON NEW PRODUCTS. THESE DATA CAN BE USED TO ASSESS MARKET TRENDS.
THE GREY LITERATURE-ONCE MORE.

MATERIAL HELD BY THE ARCHIVE, AND ITS ORGANISATION. THE ROLE AND SCOPE OF THE
LIBRARY COMPLEMENTS THAT OF THE ARCHIVE. THE ARCHIVE AND LIBRARY ARE RESEARCH
TOOLS FOR BOTH STAFF AND OTHER RESEARCHERS. THE MOVE HAS FACILITATED
REORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE. THROUGH VARIOUS
PUBLISHING VENTURES INFORMATION IN THE ARCHIVE HAS BECOME MORE WIDELY
AVAILABLE.

LIBRARIES. THE PATENT OFFICES OF WEST GERMANY AND FRANCE, EUROPEAN PATENT
OFFICE, SCIENCE REFERENCE LIBRARY IN LONDON, AND PATENT LIBRARIES OR
INFORMATION CENTRES IN NUREMBERG, LIVERPOOL, LYON, STRASBOURG, AND TOULOUSE
WERE VISITED. THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM AREAS IDENTIFIED WERE IDENTIFICATION
OF USER'S NEEDS, EXTENT OF DOCUMENTATION NEEDED, PUBLICITY PROGRAMMES,
LOCATION OF PATENT INFORMATION CENTRES, AND ORGANISATION AND STAFFING OF SUCH
CENTRES.

MAP LIBRARY USERS IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING.

REVIEWS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE CONCERNING MAP LIBRARY USERS, AND PRESENTS
SOME PROFILES OF MAP LIBRARY USERS IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING. THE PROFILES ARE
BASED ON A RECENT SURVEY OF MAP LIBRARY USERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,
AND ON METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT USER GROUPS. DISCUSSES THE SURVEY'S
FINDINGS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 4 BASIC COMPONENTS USED IN STUDIES OF LIBRARY
USERS' THE PERSON IN NEED OF INFORMATION; A SET OF PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THESE
NEEDS; THE WAYS IN WHICH THE USER MEETS THESE NEEDS, AND THE ITEMS OF
INFORMATION THAT SATISFY THESE NEEDS.
M 201 READER/PRINTER.R

EVIEW OF THE 3M 201 READER/PRINTER, DESIGNED FOR USE IN DRAFTING ROOMS,
TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRES, REPROGRAPHIC FACILITIES, AND OTHER APPLICATIONS
REQUIRING THE DISPLAY AND PRINTING OF MICROIMAGES MADE FROM ENGINEERING
DRAWINGS OR OTHER LARGE DOCUMENTS. PRESENTS A SPECIFICATION SUMMARY, AND
DETAILS OF BASIC DESIGN AND OPERATION, MICROFORMS ACCEPTED, DISPLAY
CHARACTERISTICS, PRINTER CHARACTERISTICS AND PRICE.
ADDING MICROFORMS TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' DEVELOPING A JOURNAL CONVERSION.

DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES OF PURCHASING PERIODICALS IN MICROFORM, AND OF
CONVERTING PERIODICAL BACKFILES TO MICROFORM. OUTLINES THE PROCEDURE FOR
DEVELOPING A JOURNAL CONVERSION PROGRAMME.

FOR AN ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBER'.
MULTUM IN PARVO'. APPLICATIONS OF MICROFILM IN CATHEDRAL LIBRARIES.D

ETAILED REVIEW OF THE USES OF MICROFILM IN CATHEDRAL LIBRARIES. THE ASPECTS OF
A LIBRARY FOR WHICH MICROFILM IS MOST LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERED CAN BE BROADLY
DEFINED AS HOLDINGS OF ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPTS AND ARCHIVES AND ANY COLLECTIONS
OF RARE BOOKS. THE RATIONALE BEHIND ITS USE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PRESERVATION,
SPACE REQUIREMENTS, SECURITY AND THE RAISING OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE BY
EXPLOITING UNIQUE HOLDINGS WHICH HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH VALUE IN THEIR
PARTICULAR SUBJECTS. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS IN ISSUING MICROFORMS, AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL.
A6 SIZE MICROFICHE FOR THE MOTOR INDUSTRY.

INTRODUCTION TO BRITISH STANDARDS BS 5956:1980. THE MOTOR INDUSTRY HAS, OVER
THE YEARS, GRADUALLY ADOPTED THE MICROFICHE FOR THE SUPPLY OF INFORMATION
RELATING TO SPECIFICATION AND SERVICE PARTS. A BRITISH STANDARD HAS NOW BEEN
PRODUCED, RECOMMENDING THE USE OF AN A6 MICROFICHE PRODUCED TO A 48X WITH A
TOTAL OF 270 LANDSCAPE IMAGES PER FICHE AS THE PREFERRED STANDARD, WITH AN
ALTERNATIVE OF 420 PORTRAIT IMAGES ALSO AT 48X. THE STANDARD IS RECOMMENDED
FOR INTRODUCTION BY ALL NEW USERS IN THE MOTOR INDUSTRY OF MICROFICHE SYSTEMS,
AND ALSO HAS A STRONG SUGGESTION THAT THOSE VEHICLE/ENGINE MANUFACTURERS WHO
ARE ALREADY USING A NON-STANDARD MICROFICHE SYSTEM CONSIDER CHANGING IN THE
VERY NEAR FUTURE.
VIDEO AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES: SOME NOTES AND A PROPOSAL.

THERE ARE 3 MAIN CONTEXTS IN WHICH VIDEO MAY BE USED WITHIN A PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICE-AS A STAFF TRAINING TECHNIQUE, AS A RESOURCE OFFERED WITHIN A
LIBRARY-BASED, COMMUNITY ACCESS MEDIA RESOURCE CENTRE, AND AS A REFERENCE
MATERIAL. DESCRIBES EACH CONTEXT BRIEFLY. SUGGESTS THE FORMATION OF A WORKING
PARTY WITHIN THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO EXAMINE SERIOUSLY THE POSSIBILITIES
AND RAMIFICATIONS OF VIDEO.
ACTIVITY IN THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY.

OVER RECENT YEARS A LOT OF MATERIAL HAS ACCUMULATED AT THE ABERDEEN SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP ON ACTIVITIES IN UK CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES. MUCH WAS SENT BY
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS IN RESPONSE TO A CIRCULAR; NO SYSTEMATIC SURVEY HAS BEEN
MADE. PRESENTS A SELECTION OF THE ACTIVITIES.
READING IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS: A GUIDE TO INFORMATION SOURCES.

ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF MATERIALS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF READING IN US
SCHOOLS. SECTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) THEORY, PRACTICE, AND PROGRAMMES; (2)
LITERATURE; (3) DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIATION; (4) BILINGUALISM; AND (5) LAW,
LEISURE, LITERACY.
A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN' RADCLIFFE'S SCHLESINGER LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCHLESINGER LIBRARY AT RADCLIFFE
COLLEGE, HARVARD, MASSACHUSETTS. DATING FROM 1943, IT IS THE FOREMOST
COLLECTION ON THE NATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN IN THE USA SINCE 1800. IT HAS
COLLECTIONS OF PAPERS OF NOTABLE SUFFRAGETTES, AUTHORESSES, A CONGRESSWOMAN,
AND A FEMINIST; IS THE NATIONAL REPOSITORY FOR THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR
WOMEN; IS THE SITE OF A 2,300-VOLUME CULINARY COLLECTION; AND IN 1979 WAS
VISITED BY OVER 4,000 RESEARCHERS.
QUALITY, COLLABORATION AND CITATIONS IN CANCER RESEARCH' A BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY.

(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) THE PATTERNS OF AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS
AMONG QUALITY, COLLABORATION, CITATIONS, AND SELF-CITATIONS OF CANCER RESEARCH
WERE INVESTIGATED USING SAMPLES OF PAPERS FROM 1974. THE COLLABORATIVE INDEX
(AVERAGE NUMBER OF AUTHORS PER PAPER) WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 2.98 (A HIGH
FIGURE). CANCER RESEARCH WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHLY CITED. AS QUALITY INCREASED,
SCATTER AMONG JOURNALS AND COUNTRIES DECREASED. QUANTITY AND QUALITY WITHIN A
GIVEN COUNTRY WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED. THE SELF-CITATION/TOTAL CITATION RATIO
DEPENDED ON QUALITY AND AGE OF THE PAPERS.
IN SIGHT OUT: 'AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER?'.

PRESENTS AN ANNOTATED LIST OF PUBLICATIONS AIMED AT HELPING US CHURCHES
RESPOND TO THE AGED AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED/DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED.
SUGGESTS THAT THE LIBRARY COULD SUPPLY THIS INFORMATION TO LOCAL CHURCHES;
ACQUIRE THE PUBLICATIONS FOR THEIR OWN COLLECTIONS; AND READ THE MATERIAL TO
LEARN ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES TO THESE PEOPLE. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE
PARISH IS THE DOOR TO PARTICIPATION FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND THAT THE PASTOR
MUST KEEP THE DOOR ALWAYS OPEN. COULDN'T 'LIBRARY' BE SUBSTITUTED FOR 'PARISH'
AND 'LIBRARIAN' FOR 'PASTOR'?.
MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP AND AUTHOR COLLABORATION IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
PUBLICATIONS.

THE INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF MULTIPLE AUTHOR PAPERS AND THE INCREASE IN
THE NUMBER OF AUTHORS PER PAPER IN AN AGRICULTURAL JOURNAL OVER THE PERIOD
1958 TO 1978 ARE DESCRIBED. THE FREQUENCY OF SINGLE-AUTHOR PAPERS DROPS FROM
65.5% IN 1958 TO 34.3% IN 1978 AND THE FREQUENCY OF 2-AUTHOR PAPERS INCREASES
FROM 28.1% TO 41.4%. OVER THE SAME PERIOD THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF AUTHORS PER
PAPER INCREASES FROM 1.43 TO 1.99 (MAXIMUM 2.16 IN 1976). POSSIBLE
CORRELATIONS BETWEEN AUTHOR AFFILIATIONS AND MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP ARE
SUGGESTED; AUTHORS IN NEW ZEALAND APPEAR PREFERENTIALLY TO COLLABORATE WITH
CO-AUTHORS IN THE SAME TYPE OF INSTITUTION.
WORKING PAPERS IN ACADEMIC BUSINESS LIBRARIES.

A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 119 US ACADEMIC BUSINESS LIBRARIES REQUESTING
INFORMATION ON THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE AND USE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
WORKING PAPERS. FOR COMPARISON, A SAMPLE USER SURVEY OF BUSINESS FACULTY AND
GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANTS AT 2 LARGE MIDWEST UNIVERSITIES WAS ALSO
CONDUCTED. ALTHOUGH ONLY 33% OF LIBRARIES RESPONDING ACTIVELY COLLECT WORKING
PAPERS, THESE PAPERS ARE CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION SOURCE ON CURRENT
RESEARCH BY BUSINESS FACULTIES.
PRESERVING OUR MUSICAL HERITAGE.

THE ALEXANDER TURNBULL LIBRARY IS PART OF NEW ZEALAND'S NATIONAL LIBRARY AND
IS ALSO A RESEARCH LIBRARY. ITS ROLE IN THE PRESERVATION OF THE NATION'S
MUSICAL HERITAGE, AN IMPORTANT PART OF NEW ZEALAND'S SOCIAL AND CULTURAL
HISTORY. OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARCHIVE OF NEW ZEALAND MUSIC AT THE
TURNBULL LIBRARY; THE ARCHIVE'S ACQUISITIONS POLICIES; ITS COLLECTIONS; ITS
ORGANISATION AND ROLE WITHIN THE TURNBULL LIBRARY; CONSERVATION; AND FUTURE
PLANS.
ASPECTS OF SUB-LITERATURE: FROM THE STREET TO THE WIDE SCREEN.

SURVEYS THE DEVELOPMENT OF' THE BROADSIDE; CHAPBOOK; BALLAD; 'BLOOD'; CHEAP
JOURNALS AND OTHER FORMS OF SUB-LITERATURE. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE MAIN
FEATURES OF THIS TYPE OF LITERATURE, AND THE INSIGHTS IT PROVIDES INTO THE
LIVES OF ITS READERS.
WHAT ARE THEY READING? AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF ADULT FICTION READING HABITS IN
PAPUA NEW GUINEA.

REPORT ON A POLL OF ADULT PUBLIC LIBRARY READERS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA, BASED ON
LISTS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARIANS OF THE COUNTRY'S 24 PUBLIC LIBRARIES, OF WHAT
THEY CONSIDERED TO BE THE 10 AUTHORS AND BOOKS MOST HEAVILY READ BY ADULT
FICTION READERS IN THEIR LIBRARIES. TITLES ARE LISTED, AND THE RESULTS
ANALYSED.
GATEWAY TO AMERICA: GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE NEW YORK STATE LIBRARY.

A GUIDE TO THE GENEALOGY COLLECTIONS OF THE NEW YORK STATE LIBRARY, WITH
SECTIONS ON GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH, RESEARCH MATERIALS, REFERENCE AIDS, THE
MICROFORM CENTRE, AND OTHER RECORDS WITH GENEALOGICAL INFORMATION.
GENEALOGICAL RESOURCES 'HIDDEN' WITHIN A BASIC REFERENCE COLLECTION.

PUBLIC LIBRARIANS HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE EVER-INCREASING PUBLIC INTEREST
IN FAMILY RESEARCH AS A HOBBY. FEW, HOWEVER, REALISE THAT THEIR LIBRARIES HOLD
SOURCES USEFUL FOR GENEALOGICAL SEARCHES. REVIEWS THE BASIC REFERENCE TOOLS
STOCKED BY MOST US PUBLIC LIBRARIES WHICH PROVIDE A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR
PRELIMINARY GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH.
INFORMATION SOURCES FOR ORAL HISTORY IN CANADA.

ANNOTATED LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ASSOCIATIONS, PERIODICALS, MANUALS, UNION
LISTS, BOOKS AND SOUND PROGRAMMES WHICH PROVIDE ORAL HISTORY INFORMATION
SOURCES IN CANADA.
THE FUTURE, CHANGE, AND PLANNING FOR LIBRARIES' A NEW EPOCH OF DARK AGES FOR
LIBRARIES?.

EXAMINES CONCEPTS OF 'THE FUTURE' AND OF 'CHANGE' CONTENDING THAT LIBRARY
PLANNING MUST BEGIN WITH IDENTIFICATION OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN TERMS OF THE
CHANGES LIBRARIES ARE RESPONDING TO, THE SPHERE OF CONCERN AND SCOPE OF TIME
IN WHICH CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE, THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES, AND SIGNIFICANCE
OF EFFECT WHICH NEW APPROACHES WILL HAVE. ANALYSES WHAT THE USER ACTUALLY
EXPECTS FROM A LIBRARY SERVICE, SUGGESTING THAT CREATIVE PLANNING AND
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO THE UTILISATION OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIES
ARE ESSENTIAL, IF LIBRARIANS ARE TO AVOID PLUNGING LIBRARIES INTO A NEW DARK
AGE.
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR INCREASING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.

A DISCUSSION GUIDE INTENDED TO PROVIDE A GENERAL BACKGROUND AND TO CRYSTALLISE
SOME OF THE MAJOR QUESTIONS DELEGATES MAY WISH TO ADDRESS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ROLE OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN INCREASING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.
THE SCANDIA PLAN.

THE SCANDIA PLAN IS THE COLLECTIVE NAME FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AIMED AT
INDICATING DEFICIENCES IN THE PROVISION OF LITERATURE TO THE NORDIC COUNTRIES,
PROMOTING LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN DIFFERENT AREAS, AND MAKING UNION
CATALOGUES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC AIDS TO ACHIEVE AN EFFICIENT INTERLENDING LIBRARY
SYSTEM. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLAN IS NORDINFO, THE NORDIC COUNCIL FOR
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES. DESCRIBES THE FAILURES AND
SUCCESS OF THE PLAN.
SCOPAL.

THE 2ND SESSION OF THE STANDING CONFERENCE OF PACIFIC LIBRARIES (SCOPAL) WAS
HELD IN SUVA IN OCT 79. QUESTIONS WERE RAISED THEN AS TO WHETHER IT COULD
OPERATE AS A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION WITHOUT A CONSTITUTION, MEMBERSHIP FEES
OR OVERT COMPETITION FOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS. ITS AIMS INCLUDE THE
ENCOURAGEMENT OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, LIBRARY PROJECTS AND LIAISON WITHIN THE
PACIFIC REGION, AND TO PROVIDE A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FOR PROJECT WORKERS AND
WORKING GROUPS. ALTHOUGH IT CAN OPERATE ON ITS PRESENT LINES, SCOPAL REALLY
EMBODIES A 'SPIRIT OF REGIONALISM' WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME MOTIVATES
COOPERATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. ITS WEAKNESS IS THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN ITS MEMBERS. THE SPIRIT OF REGIONAL INFORMATION COOPERATION MUST TAKE
FLESH IN ORDER TO BE SEEN AND HEARD BY GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES AS
WELL AS BY THE LIBRARIANS AND COMMUNITIES WHICH SCOPAL SERVES.
LIBRARY NETWORKS-TRENDS AND ISSUES IN EVALUATION AND GOVERNANCE.

SPEECH PRESENTED AT ILLINOIS VALLEY LIBRARY SYSTEM MEETING, 6 DEC 79. STATE OF
THE ART OF US SYSTEMS AND NETWORKING, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO EVALUATION AND
ADMINISTRATION OF NETWORKS. THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FOR ALL LIBRARIES IS THAT
DEPENDENCY OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ON EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES HAS BECOME A
CRITICAL DEPENDENCY. COSTS OF SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS ARE BECOMING MORE
SIGNIFICANT, AS IS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN SYSTEM OPERATION. THE RIGHT AND
RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AS SYSTEM MEMBERS MUST BE SEEN FROM A
FRESH PERSPECTIVE.
THE ROLE OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE EMERGING NATIONAL NETWORK' CRITICAL
ISSUES.

SPECIAL LIBRARIES HAVE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN US NETWORK
ACTIVITIES AND TO CHOOSE AMONG INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING AUTOMATED AND MANUAL
SERVICES. THE BENEFITS OF NETWORKS/COOPERATIVES TO SPECIAL LIBRARIES AS WELL
AS REAL AND IMAGINED BARRIERS TO NETWORKING BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES ARE
DISCUSSED. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARIES IN PROFIT-MAKING AND NON-PROFIT
ORGANISATIONS SHOULD COOPERATE IN A LOBBY FOR A NATIONAL NETWORK.
ACADEMIC LIBRARY AND ITS EXTERNAL RELATIONS: A SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY.

SELECTED TO AID ACADEMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN DEVELOPING A BASIC
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW A LIBRARY MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH VARIOUS CAMPUS
DEPARTMENTS, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, AND FUNDING AUTHORITIES. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE POLITICS OF CONSENSUS.

THE RECENT CONCERN FOR ACHIEVING CONSENSUS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES IN
LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EVALUATE THEIR INDIVIDUAL ROLES IN
CONSENSUAL SITUATIONS. AN EFFORT IS MADE HERE TO IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF CONSENSUS.
SPARKLE! PR FOR LIBRARY STAFF.

MANUAL OF IN-HOUSE PUBLIC RELATIONS PRACTICE, DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SCHOOL
AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INCLUDED ARE CHAPTERS ON SERVICE POLICIES, TELEPHONE AND
DESK DIPLOMACY, REFERENCE ACHIEVEMENT, IDEA FLOW FOR PROGRAMMES AND EXHIBITS,
AND STAFF SELECTION AND DEVELOPMENT.
ZZZZ.

THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT HAS, THROUGH THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION, APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO PLAN A SYSTEM OF CENTRAL
LIBRARIES. FIRSTLY, AN INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS OF THE SWEDISH INFORMATION
SYSTEM WILL BE CARRIED OUT; THEN A MODEL FOR A CENTRAL LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL
PROBABLY BE TESTED; AND FINALLY THE COMMITTEE WILL PRODUCE A PROPOSAL FOR SUCH
A SYSTEM, WITH EACH CENTRAL LIBRARY RESPONSIBLE FOR A CERTAIN AREA OF THE
TOTAL NATIONAL HOLDINGS OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE.
HISTORY OF LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN INDIA.

EXPLAINS THE NEED FOR LIBRARY LEGISLATION AND BRIEFLY OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF
SUCH LEGISLATION IN THE UK, USA, CANADA, AND JAPAN. IN INDIA, LEGISLATION HAS
BEEN REORGANISED TO CREATE A PATTERN OF NATIONAL, AS WELL AS STATE, PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE AND TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FINANCE. TRACES THE HISTORY OF
NATIONAL AND STATE LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN INDIA AND CALLS FOR THE NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT TO BRING CONFLICTING STATE LEGISLATION INTO LINE.
ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF ASKING QUESTIONS. DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPRETATION OF
LIBRARY SURVEYS.

IN AN INVESTIGATION INTO HOW PEOPLE DIFFER IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF QUESTIONS
IN LIBRARY-USER SURVEYS, A RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS GROUP (STUDENTS ON A
METHODOLOGY COURSE AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCES) WAS ASKED TO COMPLETE A 2-PART
QUESTIONNAIRE. PART 1 DESCRIBED SITUATIONS THAT OFTEN OCCUR IN A LIBRARY AND
TYPES OF CONTACT WITH READING MATERIAL AND ASKED RESPONDENTS WHETHER THEY
WOULD CALL EACH 'LIBRARY USE'. PART 2 DESCRIBED THE FREQUENCY OF SITUATIONS
AND ASKED FOR AN APPROPRIATE ADVERB, SUCH AS 'SELDOM' OR 'OFTEN'. THE
RESPONSES SHOWED A SURPRISING VARIATION, AN INDICATION THAT THE QUESTIONNAIRE
PROCEDURE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS DISTORTION IF USED IN A QUANTITATIVE
INVESTIGATION.
AN OPEN SYSTEM THEORY APPROACH TO LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.

BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE MEASUREMENT OF LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS USING THE OPEN
SYSTEM THEORY OF ORGANISATIONS AND A MODEL FOR EVALUATION OF ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES APPROPRIATE TO THE OPEN SYSTEM. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A 1955
RESEARCH PROJECT IN WHICH THEY WERE USED (EVALUATION OF COLLEGE LIBRARIES FOR
ACCREDITATION PURPOSES, BY ALAN DALE COVEY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY EDD
DISSERTATION) AND MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.
ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS.

A PRELIMINARY STUDY TO PROBE THE VIEWS OF LIBRARIANS, RELATING TO THE ROLE OF
EVALUATION AND THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN A
10% SAMPLE OF LIBRARY AUTHORITIES IN ENGLAND IN SEPT 79-MAY 80. OPINIONS WERE
SOUGHT FROM CHIEF LIBRARIANS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS AND SENIOR
MANAGEMENT. A WORKSHOP WAS SET UP TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE LEVELS OF
UNDERSTANDING OF AND COMMITMENT TO THE USE OF EVALUATIVE TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO
LIBRARY PERFORMANCE. 2 DETAILED CHECKLISTS RELATING TO EFFECTIVENESS AND
EVALUATIVE DESIGN WERE GENERATED AND USED AS A BASIS FOR THE WORK. THE NEED
FOR GUIDANCE ON TERMINOLOGY AND DIRECTION ON METHODS WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
BUT WAS DEEMED LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE IF IMPOSED BY AGENCIES EXTERNAL TO
LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS. A STATE OF THE ART.

PAPERS PRESENTED AT A 1980 AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (ALA) PRECONFERENCE,
SPONSORED BY THE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION, LIBRARY
RESEARCH ROUND TABLE, AND REFERENCE & ADULT SERVICE DIVISION (ALL ALA
DIVISIONS), NEW YORK, 27-28 JUNE 80. FOR ABSTRACTS, SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'.
INTER-LIBRARY COMPARISONS. REPORT TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY ON A FEASIBILITY
STUDY, JULY 1977.

STUDY CONCERNED WITH THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING INTER-LIBRARY
COMPARISONS. THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY INCLUDED' A SERIES OF VISITS TO ACADEMIC,
PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES UNDERTAKEN TO FAMILIARISE CIFC WITH THE WORKINGS
OF A SAMPLE OF LIBRARIES; EXAMINATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH LIBRARIES MIGHT
BE COMPARED BY INTERFIRM COMPARISON METHODS; INDICATION OF POSSIBLE MEASURES
OF LIBRARY PERFORMANCE; AND DISCUSSION OF FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES WITH THE BLRD
AND OTHER INTERESTED ORGANISATIONS.
TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES' AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS.

INVESTIGATES THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS AND POSSIBLE MEANINGS OF THE TRADITIONAL
MEASURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN ORDER TO (1) UNDERSTAND THE
INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN
TRADITIONALLY MAINTAINED BY LIBRARIES, IDENTIFYING THOSE THAT ARE REDUNDANT
AND THOSE THAT ARE UNIQUE; (2) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OF THESE MEASURES
ON ALL OTHER MEASURES; AND (3) UNDERSTAND THE VALIDITY OF THESE MEASURES,
SINGLY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHERS, AS INDICATORS OF LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.
THE DATA USED IS THAT COLLECTED IN THE 1974 US PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEY, WHICH
ASKED FOR DATA ON 60 MEASURES.
THE USE OF EMPIRICAL STANDARDS IN ASSESSING PUBLIC LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.

REPORTS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 1977-78 IN WHICH MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS
WAS USED TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF (MAINLY) RESOURCE VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING
THE LEVEL OF CIRCULATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. CONCLUDES
THAT' THE LEVELS OF THE VARIABLES EXPLAIN VERY HIGH PROPORTIONS OF THE
VARIANCE OF LIBRARY USE; RESEARCHERS ARE NOT YET JUSTIFIED IN CALLING THE
OBSERVED RELATIONSHIPS INPUT-OUTPUT FUNCTIONS; AND, DESPITE THIS, THE STRENGTH
OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDES A POWERFUL TOOL FOR COMPARING PERFORMANCES OF
LIBRARIES AND FOR PREDICTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF A GIVEN LIBRARY.
COLLECTION SIZE AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCHES.

DESCRIBES THE LOGAN SQUARE EXPERIMENTAL BOOK BRANCH OF CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY.
THIS BRANCH LIBRARY IS AIMING TO PROVIDE A BETTER SERVICE TO EXISTING USERS
AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO 'OUTREACH' TO THE COMMUNITY. STAFF RESOURCES HAVE
DECREASED DURING THE EXPERIMENT AND THE BOOK BUDGET IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE
OF SIMILARLY-SIZED LIBRARIES. IN 1978-79 (THE EXPERIMENT'S 1ST YEAR), THE
BOOKSTOCK WAS INCREASED FROM 45,000 TO 66,500 VOLUMES (MAINLY BY ACCEPTING
DISCARDS FROM OTHER BRANCHES) AND A MAGAZINE COLLECTION WAS STARTED. AFTER
DECLINING FOR 10 YEARS, CIRCULATION INCREASED BY 19% IN 1979. IT IS TOO EARLY
TO ANALYSE THE EXPERIMENT'S RESULTS, BUT THE FUTURE LOOKS GOOD. PERHAPS THIS
IS A TRUE MEASURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT AND COST ANALYSIS' AN ESSENTIAL EVALUATION DUALITY.

DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANALYSIS OF LEVELS OF SERVICE (SERVICE
ADEQUACY) AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, NORTHRIDGE, LIBRARY. THE ANALYSIS
INCORPORATES THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT SERVICE A PARTICULAR TASK PROVIDES (AND
FOR WHOM) AND THE CRITERIA BY WHICH THE PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY STAFF JUDGE THE
SERVICE'S ADEQUACY. GIVES TRUE EXAMPLES INVOLVING 11 LIBRARY TASKS.
EVALUATION OF REFERENCE SERVICE IN COLLEGE LIBRARIES, IN NEW SOUTH WALES,
AUSTRALIA.

REPORTS ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW SOUTH WALES COLLEGE
OF ADVANCED EDUCATION LIBRARIES WHICH COVERED THE LIBRARIES' OBJECTIVES,
TECHNIQUES BEING USED TO EVALUATE THE LIBRARIES (PARTICULARLY THE REFERENCE
SERVICE), AND FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE
REFERENCE SERVICE. THE INVESTIGATION WAS ALSO A PILOT STUDY TO TEST A
METHODOLOGY FOR ESTABLISHING THE PROPORTION OF QUESTIONS FOR WHICH LIBRARY
STAFF PROVIDE COMPLETE, CORRECT ANSWERS AND THE TIME TAKEN. DISCUSSES THE
RESULTS OBTAINED AND THE DIFFICULTY OF EVALUATING REFERENCE SERVICES BECAUSE
OF THE MANY INTER-RELATED FACTORS INVOLVED.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR ADULT EDUCATION' THE MEASUREMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS.

WHEN AN ADULT STUDENT UNDERTAKES A COURSE OF STUDY, HE USUALLY PASSES THROUGH
3 MAIN STAGES' (1) FINDING OUT ABOUT THE COURSES AVAILABLE; (2) OBTAINING
MATERIALS AND INFORMATION DURING THE COURSE; AND (3) FOLLOWING-UP PARTICULAR
INTERESTS AFTER THE COURSE. DESCRIBES A LIBRARY'S INVOLVEMENT IN ALL 3 STAGES,
HOW THE LIBRARY CAN MOST EFFECTIVELY SERVE ADULT PART-TIME STUDENTS, AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN MEETING INFORMATION CONSUMER'S NEEDS.

PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS
OF MEETING CITIZENS' INFORMATION NEEDS. RESIDENTS FROM 2,400 RANDOMLY-SELECTED
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES OF THE USA PARTICIPATED IN 15-MINUTE
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, JULY-OCT 79. IT APPEARS THAT THEY INFREQUENTLY CONSULT
LIBRARIES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE IN WORK OR NON-WORK SITUATIONS. OF THE
17% USING LIBRARIES, THE MAJORITY (11%) DO NOT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LIBRARY AS AN INFORMATION PROVIDER. TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITORS WITH
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LIBRARIES MUST PUBLICISE RESOURCES AND SERVICES
MORE EFFECTIVELY, IMPROVE DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITY, AND IDENTIFY AND
REDUCE BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED BY THE CITIZEN WHEN ATTEMPTING TO GAIN ACCESS TO
INFORMATION.
USER SATISFACTION AS A MEASURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY PERFORMANCE.

PRESENTS AND ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF A USER SATISFACTION SURVEY OF ST. PAUL'S
PUBLIC LIBRARY, MINNESOTA. 245 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED AND 208 USABLE
ONES WERE RETURNED. THE SURVEY WAS BASED ON A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WHICH TREATS
USER SATISFACTION AS A FUNCTION OF (1) THE USER'S DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS,
(2) THE VARIOUS USES MADE OF THE LIBRARY BY THE USER, AND (3) THE USER'S
EVALUATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LIBRARY USED.
AN EVALUATIVE, HOLISTIC, AND USER-ORIENTED APPROACH TO ASSESSING AND
MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IN ITS SETTING.

DESCRIBES RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN TO BROADEN THE THEORETICAL BASE ON WHICH
EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES CAN BE DETERMINED, TO TRANSLATE FINDINGS
INTO OPERATIONAL TERMS, AND TO TEST OPERATIONALLY A SYSTEM OF ASSESSING AND
MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS. THE METHODOLOGY
DEVELOPED WAS CENTRED ON A LIBRARY USER QUESTIONNAIRE IN WHICH THE USERS WERE
ASKED TO RATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE, LEVEL OF USER SATISFACTION, USER
BENEFIT, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH LIBRARY SERVICE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS
TESTED IN A COLLEGE, WITH PROMISING RESULTS. THIS LINE OF RESEARCH IS
CONTINUING.
IMPROVING LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS: A PROPOSAL FOR APPLYING FUZZY SET CONCEPTS IN
THE MANAGEMENT OF LARGE COLLECTIONS.

PRESENTS' A BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON FUZZY SETS; AN INTRODUCTION TO THE
FUNDAMENTALS OF FUZZY SET THEORY; AN AVENUE OF APPROACH FOR APPLICATIONS OF
THE THEORY IN A LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT; AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT OF FUZZY APPLICATIONS IN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
SUPERVISORY AND MIDDLE MANAGERS IN LIBRARIES.

SURVEY AND MANUAL OF MIDDLE MANAGEMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS WITH
SECTIONS ON DEFINITIONS, ORGANISATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARY, TYPES OF
PERSONNEL EMPLOYED IN LIBRARIES, STUDIES OF MIDDLE MANAGEMENT, AND EDUCATION
AND TRAINING OF SUPERVISORS AND MIDDLE MANAGERS.
ADVANCING LIBRARY MARKETING.

SINCE THE USE OF MARKETING TOOLS IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION IS NOW WELL
ACCEPTED, SEEKS TO (1) CORRECT MISAPPLICATIONS IN PRESENT USES OF MARKETING,
(2) UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF APPLICATIONS, AND (3) INTRODUCE SEVERAL NEW
APPLICATIONS THAT CAN EXTEND THE RANGE OF MARKETING CONTRIBUTIONS. FURTHER
INTERACTION BETWEEN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS AND MARKETING PROFESSIONALS CAN
ONLY STRENGTHEN BOTH DISCIPLINES.
THE ADMINISTRATION OF A LARGE MAP COLLECTION.

HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK IN ENSURING THE
EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATION OF A LARGE MAP COLLECTION. DISCUSSES' THE
RELATIONSHIP OF THE LARGE COLLECTION TO ITS CONTROLLING BODY; THE SUCCESSFUL
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTERRELATED RESOURCES OF MONEY, STAFF, SPACE; AND THE
QUALITIES REQUIRED OF A MAP CURATOR-ADMINISTRATOR.
CENTRALISED/DECENTRALISED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SERVICES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA' A
SURVEY.

SURVEY DESIGNED TO OBTAIN GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE PRESENT SET-UP OF
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE ASEAN (ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN
NATIONS) REGION, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CENTRALISATION/DECENTRALISATION. A
QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DISTRIBUTED TO 20 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES (5 IN INDONESIA, 5 IN
MALAYSIA, 4 IN THE PHILIPPINES, 2 IN SINGAPORE AND 4 IN THAILAND). THE
QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS, COVERING BASIC STATISTICS/INFORMATION,
AND ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION, FURTHER SUBDIVIDED BY LIBRARIES
ADMINISTERED BY THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIAN OR THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, AND
DECENTRALISED LIBRARIES/BOOK COLLECTIONS NOT ADMINISTERED BY THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIAN OR CENTRAL LIBRARY. RESULTS ARE ANALYSED IN DETAIL.
IMPROVEMENT OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIFIED INFORMATION STOCK OF A REPUBLIC.

NOTE. AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THIS ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, (1) 1980, 42-51. A METHOD IS PRESENTED WHICH
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEETING USERS' DEMANDS FOR
DOCUMENTATION. THE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON OPTIMISATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF
THE EXISTING DOCUMENTATION/INFORMATION STOCK OF A REPUBLIC, TREATS THE STOCK
AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM CONSISTING OF SEVERAL SUB-SYSTEMS. THE ORGANISATIONAL
AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE STOCK OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES ARE
MINIMAL.
METHODS OF SYSTEMS ANALYSIS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

A SYSTEMS APPROACH BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES REPRESENTS A
STARTING POINT ASSURING WIDE THEORETICAL GENERALISATION OF THE ACQUIRED
KNOWLEDGE WHILE ALLOWING A CONTINUOUS LINK WITH REALITY. A LIBRARY SYSTEM, BY
ITS SPECIFIC CHARACTER, IS PART OF A WIDE COMMUNITY SYSTEM, FULFILLING
SPECIFIC TASKS IN THE SOCIETY. THE CONCEPT 'LIBRARY SYSTEM' IS DEFINED AND
OTHER ISSUES CONCERNING THE THEORY OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS INVESTIGATED.
CHANGES DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS (1969-1978) IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY DECISION
PROCESS FOR THE PLACEMENT AND RENEWAL OF SCHOLARLY PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1969-78. THROUGH MOST OF THE DECADE, THE LIBRARIES RELIED ON
A SERIES OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OR HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,
SHIFTING FROM MONOGRAPHIC TO SERIALS EXPENDITURE AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATES.
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE THEY BEEN FORCED TO TURN TO CONSORTIA AND
NETWORKS TO ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURES ON THEM. THE LIBRARIES MUST FACE THEIR
PROBLEMS SQUARELY IN THE 1980S AND PRODUCE LEADERS WITH THE ASTUTENESS,
COURAGE, AND PERSUASIVENESS TO MAKE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEMS. ONLY THEN, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCORD, WILL
ACADEMIC LIBRARY COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES MOVE FORWARD MORE RAPIDLY AND
PURPOSEFULLY.
GRANT MONEY AND HOW TO GET IT.

DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND OBTAINING EXTERNAL FUNDS, OR GRANTS,
FOR LIBRARY PROGRAMMES. WHILST ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PROPOSALS ARE FUNDED
BY GRANTS, THE FAILURE RATE IS OFTEN DUE TO THE GRANT SEEKERS' LACK OF
RESEARCH ON THE PROSPECTIVE GRANTOR.
THE FISCAL IMPACT OF GENERAL REVENUE SHARING ON ILLINOIS PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

INCREASING DEMANDS UPON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE USA TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC SERVICES HAVE PLACED GREAT PRESSURES ON LIMITED BUDGETS. GENERAL
REVENUE SHARING, WHICH AROSE AS A CONCEPT IN THE 60S, WAS INTRODUCED THROUGH
THE STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1972, WHICH WAS REPLACED BY A 1976
ACT. PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY OF GENERAL REVENUE SHARING FROM FISCAL
YEAR 1973 THROUGH FY 1977, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON HOW SUCCESSFUL ILLINOIS
LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN IN OBTAINING GRS FUNDING.
METHODS FOR SETTING RENTAL AND DISCARD PRICES.

A RECENT REVIEW OF RENTAL COLLECTION ADMINISTRATION AT NEW ZEALAND'S HASTINGS
PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOWED THAT INCOME FROM RENTING BOOKS WAS NOT KEEPING PACE WITH
EXPENDITURE ON THE RENTAL COLLECTION. SUGGESTS A NEW METHOD FOR SETTING RENTAL
CHARGES (BASED ON RECOVERY OF PURCHASE PRICE IN 16 ISSUES) AND PRESENTS A
METHOD OF WORKING OUT THE DISCARD PRICE OF LIBRARY MATERIALS (ON THE BASIS
THAT THEY LOSE A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEIR VALUE WITH EACH CIRCULATION).
BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY: BALANCING THE BOOKS.

OUTLINES THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY AND ITS RICH
COLLECTIONS; DESCRIBES THE FINANCIAL PRESSURES NOW ACTING ON IT (THE BUDGET
SUBMITTED IN SPRING 80 WAS CUT FROM $11.3 MILLION TO $9.3 MILLION AND A
FURTHER CUT OF 35% IS RUMOURED); OUTLINES THE RESULTANT DAMAGE TO SERVICES
(BOOKMOBILE SERVICE, MULTILINGUAL LIBRARY, AND HOSPITAL LIBRARY SERVICE UNITS
ALL CLOSED; OPENING HOURS EVERYWHERE SEVERELY CURTAILED); AND DISCUSSES THE
ACTIONS OF THE DIRECTOR AND THE MAYOR OF BOSTON (WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
MAKING LIBRARY TRUSTEE APPOINTMENTS ON POLITICAL GROUNDS RATHER THAN BY
MERIT).
A PUBLIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

DISCUSSES EXISTING LIBRARY BUDGET THEORIES AND SYSTEMS AND DESCRIBES IN DETAIL
THE COMPUTER-BASED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INCORPORATING A BUDGET SYSTEM DESIGNED BY
THE AUTHOR FOR PIKES PEAK REGIONAL LIBRARY DISTRICT, COLORADO SPRINGS,
COLORADO.
SURVIVING THE PRESENT: SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC LIBRARY.

THE 102-YEAR-OLD 26-BRANCH SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC LIBRARY IS UNDER GREAT
FINANCIAL PRESSURE DUE TO INFLATION AND THE RESULTS OF PROPOSITION 13 (A
MEASURE PASSED IN 1978 WHICH CUT CALIFORNIA STATE PROPERTY TAXES BY ABOUT 55%,
HITTING ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES). OUTLINES THE RESULTANT CUTS AND
ECONOMIES AND DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S FRIENDS WHO STAFF THE
MAIN LIBRARY INFORMATION DESK FOR 50 HOURS WEEKLY, PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY'S
ACTIVITIES, AND RAISE MONEY. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES SOME COLLECTIONS IN THE MAIN
LIBRARY; THE MUCH-USED BUSINESS BRANCH AND CHINATOWN BRANCH; AND THE

SEMINAR REPORT: 'APPLICATION OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
PROCESSING-AN ASIAN REGIONAL SEMINAR.

THE SEMINAR WAS PRESENTED BY THE INSTITUTE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF
THE PHILIPPINES, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNESCO NATIONAL COMMISSION OF THE
PHILIPPINES, 17-28 NOV 80. ITS EMPHASIS WAS ON THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF
AUTOMATION IN THE REGION, PARTICULARLY THE USE OF LOCAL AND EXTERNALLY
PRODUCED DATA BASES. ALSO DISCUSSED WERE GLOBAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, UNESCO'S
INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, AND THE RELEVANCE OF SUCH
TECHNOLOGY TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

COVERS THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN THE USA. BEGINS
WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NETWORKS, DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF OCLC AND ADOPTION
OF MARC. THE 2ND STEP IS SEEN AS THE GROWTH OF ON-LINE DATA BASES, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO LOCKHEED, SDC AND BRS. COSTS, THOUGH, HAVE DETERRED
FULL USE OF THESE. MAKES A CASE FOR STANDARDISATION OF FORMATS. THE EFFECT OF
ON-LINE SYSTEMS ON RETRIEVAL IS RELATED TO THE INCREASING INTEREST IN DOCUMENT
DELIVERY SYSTEMS. NOTES THE CONTRIBUTION OF MINI- AND MICROCOMPUTERS TO THIS
AREA. CENTRALISED SHARED SYSTEMS HAVE ALLOWED AUTOMATION TO PROGRESS. ALL THIS
NEEDS PARALLELING IN THE LIBRARY SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE DIFFICULTY IN PROVIDING
THE FACILITIES. THE REAL PROBLEM LIES IN MAKING SYSTEMS USER FRIENDLY. PERHAPS
LIBRARIANS SHOULD CULTIVATE SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN PROGRAMMING, USING EASY
HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES LIKE FORTH AND SPEAKEASY. WORD PROCESSORS ALSO WILL NEED
TO BE A STANDARD PART OF LIBRARY  EQUIPMENT. THE FUTURE MUST LIE IN ACHIEVING
ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION FROM A TERMINAL.
LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN AUSTRALIA' THE STATE OF THE ART.

BOTH THE 14.5 MILLION POPULATION AND THE DISTANCE WHICH AUSTRALIA IS FROM THE
MAJOR PUBLISHING CENTRES MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTHUSIASM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY.
AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES WERE EARLY USERS OF MICROCOMPUTERS. A GROWTH IN THE
COUNTRY'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS HAS CULMINATED IN THE INTRODUCTION OF MIDAS IN
79, AND USE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES VIA LOCKHEED, SDC AND OCLC. ACCESS TO DATA
BASES WITHIN AUSTRALIA IS NOW ACHIEVED THROUGH AUSINET AND CSIRONET. THIS HAS
PROMOTED LIBRARY AUTOMATION, DEALT WITH HERE IN 3 PHASES' (1) RELATES TO
PUNCHED-CARD SYSTEMS; (2) IS CHARACTERISED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AUSMARC IN
71, AND THE AUSTRALIAN MARC RECORD SERVICE; AND (3) COVERS THE SHARED SYSTEMS
AND COOPERATIVE NETWORKS. BRIEFLY SURVEYS THE FUTURE WHICH SEEMS LARGELY
DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMME FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE A NATIONWIDE SERVICE.
NAVY LIBRARIES: INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM. PROCEEDINGS OF THE
CONSATL WORKSHOP AND MEETING (38TH), 23-25 APRIL 1980.

SYSTEMS ANALYSIS; BASIS-BATTELLE'S DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM; DATA BASE INPUT,
CIRCULATION SYSTEMS.
THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON THE STAFF AND ORGANIZATION OF A MEDIUM-SIZED
ACADEMIC LIBRARY' A CASE STUDY.

A CASE STUDY EXAMINING THE GENERAL EFFECTS OF AUTOMATING OPERATIONS IN A
MEDIUM SIZED ACADEMIC LIBRARY ON BOTH THE STAFF AND THE ORGANISATION OVER A 10
YEAR PERIOD REVEALS THAT THE MAJOR IMPACT HAS BEEN THE REAPPRAISAL OF
FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVES AND THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT. IN REGARD TO PERSONNEL, THERE
HAS BEEN AN OVERALL SAVING IN LABOUR COSTS, AND WHILE IT HAS DECREASED
PROFESSIONAL STAFF REQUIREMENTS, IT HAS INCREASED SUPPORT STAFF POSITIONS,
MANY OF WHICH REQUIRE GREATER SKILL, EXPERIENCE, AND TRAINING. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
MICROS IN THE LIBRARY MEDIA CENTER?.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE FACTORS DETERMINING THE INTRODUCTION OF MICROCOMPUTERS
INTO THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA CENTRE-POTENTIAL USE, HARDWARE, PERIPHERALS,
COST, EXPERTISE WITHIN THE SCHOOL, SOFTWARE, MANAGEMENT, AND LIKELY RESULTS.
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALIST IS ALSO THE BEST PLACED STAFF MEMBER TO
ADVISE THE REST OF THE SHOOL ON ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. A NEW READER.

COLLECTION OF 70 MAINLY ORIGINAL READINGS ON SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP ALTHOUGH A
FEW ARE REPRINTS OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED DURING THE 1970S. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE
ARRANGED UNDER 7 HEADINGS' THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES;
THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL; THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN-MANAGED AND
MANAGING; HOST-ORGANISATION-RELATED; PUBLIC-RELATIONS-RELATED;
TOOL/FORMAT-RELATED; THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN AS INFORMATION SCIENTIST.
AN ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CAREER CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP.

THIS STUDY OF FULL-TIME LIBRARY STUDENTS AT THE GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR
TEACHERS' SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WAS UNDERTAKEN (1) TO DELINEATE WHY EACH
OF THE STUDENTS DECIDED UPON LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER; (2) TO DETERMINE WHAT
EFFECT LIBRARY-RELATED EXPERIENCES HAD UPON THAT CAREER CHOICE; (3) TO
ESTABLISH THE PERSONAL CONCEPTIONS OF THE CANDIDATES WITH REGARD TO A CAREER
IN LIBRARY SCIENCE; (4) TO MEASURE THE EFFECT THAT THE SCHOOL HAS UPON THE
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER; (5) TO IDENTIFY WHAT BRANCH OF LIBRARY
SCIENCE THE CANDIDATES WISH TO PURSUE; AND (6) TO ASCERTAIN WHY PARTICULAR
CANDIDATES CHOSE TO ATTEND PEABODY. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SALARY SURVEY OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS IN THE MIDCONTINENTAL REGIONAL MEDICAL
LIBRARY GROUP.

ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF A SALARY SURVEY OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS IN THE
MIDCONTINENTAL REGIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY GROUP IN THE USA. THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS
THAT, WHILE BEING CERTIFIED BY THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OR HAVING A
MASTER'S DEGREE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE A HIGH SALARY, THE 2
FACTORS DO TEND TO RAISE THE SALARY OF THE HOSPITAL LIBRARIAN. SUGGESTS A MODE
SALARY RANGE FOR HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS, AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE SURVEY'S
RESULTS WILL HELP TO ESTABLISH A BASE LINE FROM WHICH HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS CAN
DISCUSS SALARY STRUCTURES WITH ADMINISTRATORS.
SUPERVISORY TRAINING IN LIBRARIES' PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL, COMMUNICATION,
DECISION-MAKING, AND MOTIVATION.

LIBRARIES ARE PROVIDING FORMAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES FOR THE TRAINING
OF SUPERVISORS IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMAL PROGRAMME OF ON-THE-JOB TRAINING.

FOR DEVELOPING THE SKILLS OF BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND NON-PROFESSIONAL STAFF,
RANGING FROM ON-THE-JOB TRAINING TO EXTERNAL COURSES, AND PROVIDES DETAILED
INFORMATION ON THE COURSE CONTENT. EXAMINES THE RANGE OF EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE
TO ASSIST TRAINING OFFICERS, AND LOOKS AT THE MERITS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF THE
VARIOUS TRAINING AIDS.
WHITE COLLAR UNIONS IN LIBRARIES.

(PAPER SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILMENT OF REQUIREMENTS FOR AN MA DEGREE.)
PRESENTS A PICTURE OF THE UNIONISATION OF WHITE-COLLAR LIBRARY STAFFS
NATIONALLY AND IN A SAMPLE OF BRITISH LIBRARIES. CHAPTER 1 SHOWS THE VARIETY
OF UNIONS RECRUITING SUCH STAFF AND SKETCHES THE ROLES PLAYED BY NALGO, AUT
(ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY TEACHERS), NATFHE (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS
OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION), APT (ASSOCIATION OF POLYTECHNIC TEACHERS)
AND ASTMS (ASSOCIATION OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL STAFFS). ALSO
DISCUSSES THE PART PLAYED BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THESE ORGANISATIONS. CHAPTER 2 COVERS AREAS OF CONCERN OF UNIONS AT
NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL UNDER THE HEADINGS' INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; POLICY;
EDUCATION AND TRAINING; AND POLITICAL CONCERNS. CHAPTER 3 COMMENTS ON
INVOLVEMENT OF LIBRARY STAFFS IN UNION AFFAIRS AND THEIR ATTITUDES TO UNIONS.
CHAPTER 4 SUGGESTS ALTERNATIVE NEGOTIATING MACHINERY FOR LIBRARIANS IN NALGO
AND THE IDEA OF FORMING A UNIFIED TRADE UNION.
THE WORK OF THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST.

PAPER PRESENTED TO THE MEETING OF THE CENTRUM VOOR LITERATUURONDERZOEKERS
(CENTRE FOR INFORMATION SPECIALISTS), AMSTERDAM, 15 OCT 80. THE TREND TOWARDS
DECENTRALISATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES IN
INDUSTRIAL ORGANISATIONS AND THE INCREASING USE OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE WORK OF THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST. THE
PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS CONCERNED WITH LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE MUST PUBLICISE THE WORK OF THEIR MEMBERS MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE
CENTRES OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND AT INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING COURSES. THE
INFORMATION SPECIALIST MUST CONVINCE THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS ORGANISATION THAT
AUTOMATION WILL NOT ENABLE DUTIES NORMALLY PERFORMED IN THE LIBRARY TO BE
TAKEN OVER BY TECHNICAL STAFF. THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLICY PLANNING OF HIS ORGANISATION.
MIDDLE MANAGERS IN ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES' MANAGERIAL ROLE CONCEPTS.

(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.) DESCRIBES AND DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A
STUDY WHICH IDENTIFIED AND EXAMINED MANAGERIAL ROLE CONCEPTS OF LIBRARY MIDDLE
MANAGERS WITH RESPECT TO DIMENSION, CONFLICT, AMBIGUITY, AND SATISFACTION.
SEVERAL RESULTS ARE FURTHER SCRUITINISED FOR POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE
AND FEMALE SUBJECTS AND/OR BETWEEN PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC SUBJECTS.
THE FUTURE OF CATALOGERS AND CATALOGING.

THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE SEEN MANY CHANGES IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENTS OF US
RESEARCH LIBRARIES. REDUCED BUDGETS, LESS EMPHASIS ON PERFECTION, GREATER USE
OF LIBRARY ASSISTANTS, STANDARDISATION, AND AUTOMATION HAVE HAD A PROFOUND
EFFECT UPON THE PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF CATALOGUERS. IF CURRENT TRENDS
CONTINUE, FUTURE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON THE SHARING OF HIGH QUALITY BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS THROUGH A NATIONAL NETWORK. AS THE AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL CATALOGUING
DECREASES, THE CATALOGUER OF THE FUTURE WILL MORE LIKELY BE A MANAGER WITH
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LIBRARY'S BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL SYSTEM. ONLY IN LARGER
RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL CATALOGUING
REMAIN. ANOTHER POSSIBLE SCENARIO WILL BE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CATALOGUERS AS
PUBLIC AND TECHNICAL SERVICES STAFF MERGE INTO INTEGRATED SUBJECT UNITS.

YEARS 1980 AND 1981.

IN THE YEAR 1981 THE TECHNICKE USTREDI KNIHOVEN V PRAZE (TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR
LIBRARIES, PRAGUE) ENTERED ITS 2ND DECADE OF ITS ACTIVITIES. IT STARTED
MODESTLY WITH THE SUPPLY OF 1 AID (METAL FRAMES FOR ORIENTATION SIGNS) TO 4
LIBRARIES. IN 1980 THE CENTRE HAD IN ITS STOCK 45 KINDS OF FORMS (SUCH AS
ACCESSION LISTS, LIST OF PERIODICALS, LIST OF WITHDRAWALS), AND OVER 60 KINDS
OF AIDS. THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN 1,600 LIBRARIES.
WHAT'S THAT FUNNY NOISE?' VIDEOGAMES IN THE LIBRARY.A

 YEAR AGO, FLESH PUBLIC LIBRARY, PIQUA, OHIO, INTRODUCED AN ELECTRONIC
LEARNING CENTRE TO INTRODUCE THE 25,000-STRONG PREDOMINANTLY RURAL COMMUNITY
TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE CENTRE CONTAINS A PUBLIC MICROCOMPUTER, VIDEOTAPE
AND CAMERA SERVICES, AND A VIDEOGAME CONSOLE WITH 17 GAME CARTRIDGES. THE
VIDEOGAMES HAVE ATTRACTED MANY YOUNG IRREGULAR LIBRARY USERS WHO MAY, IN TIME,
EXTEND THEIR ATTENTION TO OTHER LIBRARY FACILITIES. THE COST OF ESTABLISHING
AND MAINTAINING THE VIDEOGAME AREA HAS BEEN REASONABLE AND PROBLEMS OF
DISCIPLINE, NOISE, AND SUPERVISION HAVE BEEN MINIMAL DUE TO CAREFUL PLANNING.
NO CHARGE IS MADE FOR PLAYING THE GAMES.

FACING THE PUBLIC.

PONDERS ON THE JOINT PROMOTIONS OFFERED BY THE MCDONALD'S FAST-FOOD CHAIN AND
THE US PUBLIC LIBRARY, SUGGESTING THAT THE FORMER POSSESSES ALL THE ATTRIBUTES
THAT THE LATTER HANKERS AFTER. LIBRARIANS HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR NICE,
CLEAN-CUT, DEFINABLE, EASILY-RETRIEVABLE QUESTIONS. UNLIKE FAST-FOOD CHAINS,
HOWEVER, THE LIBRARY HAS A MANDATE TO SERVE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND INDIVIDUAL
NEEDS. OTHERWISE THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT TO EXIST, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF
FAST-FOOD ITEMS (SUCH AS PAPERBACKS AND ROCK RECORDS) THAT IT CIRCULATES.
SMALL LIBRARIES' KEEPING THE PROFESSIONAL POSITION PROFESSIONAL.

DESCRIBES HOW THE LIBRARIAN IN A SMALL ORGANISATION, UNAWARE OF THE BENEFITS
OF AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SERVICE, CAN PROMOTE THE LIBRARY MAKING MANAGEMENT
AND USERS AWARE OF ITS POTENTIAL. INCLUDES HOW TO ENHANCE THE PRESTIGE OF THE
LIBRARIAN AND IMPROVE COMMUNICATION.
AN ALL YEAR ROUND CHILDREN'S BOOK WEEK.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THE ANNUAL CHILDREN'S BOOK WEEK IS ORGANISED BY PUBLISHERS
AND BOOKSELLERS TO PROMOTE THE SALE OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS. LIBRARIANS, HOWEVER,
SHOULD AIM AT ALL YEAR ROUND STIMULATION OF CHILDREN'S READING INTERESTS.
WORKING GROUPS CAN BE FORMED IN EACH COMMUNITY WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE
LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND OTHER INTERESTED ORGANISATIONS TO PROVIDE A PROGRAMME
OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN. SUCH ACTIVITIES MAY BE ARRANGED WITH LOCAL
SCHOOLS AS PART OF THE SCHOOL TIMETABLE OR MAY BE PROVIDED OUTSIDE SCHOOL
HOURS. ACTIVITIES MAY INCLUDE READING OF 1 OR MORE SET BOOKS, WRITING SHORT
STORIES AND POETRY, AND PROVIDING ILLUSTRATIONS TO A SET BOOK. CHILDREN WHO
HAVE PARTICIPATED IN SUCH PROGRAMMES OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO
BECOME REGULAR LIBRARY USERS.
BUSINESSMEN TRY TO STUMP LIBRARIANS.

SAN BERNADINO, CALIFORNIA, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HOLDS A WEEKLY MEETING, THE
KOFFEE KLATCH, DESIGNED TO GIVE NEW CHAMBER MEMBERS A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT

LIBRARIES AS A LINK IN A NATIONAL INFORMATION POLICY.

AN INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON LIBRARIES AS PUBLIC INFORMATION CENTRES INDICATES
THAT NORWAY IS POSSIBLY THE MOST ADVANCED OF THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES (THE
SWEDISH REPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE). MOVES ARE AFOOT TO CONVINCE COMMITTEES THAT
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, UNTIL NOW OVERLOOKED, ARE ALREADY LARGELY EQUIPPED AS
INFORMATION CENTRES. IN DENMARK A LIBRARY COMMISSION WAS SET UP IN 1976 TO
CONSIDER ALTERATIONS IN THE DANISH LIBRARY SERVICE, INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF
A NATIONAL INFORMATION AND LIBRARY POLICY, AND LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED
FOLLOWING THEIR 1979 REPORT. IN ICELAND A COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1975 TO
PLAN FUTURE INFORMATION POLICY, AND AN INFORMATION SERVICE, PARTLY
TECHNICAL/SCIENTIFIC AND PARTLY A GENERAL NATIONAL INFORMATION BODY, BEGAN
OPERATION IN 1978-79. FINLAND HAS SO FAR HAD NO OFFICIAL INFORMATION POLICY,
BUT IN 1980 INVESTIGATIONS BEGAN INTO REASONS FOR SUCH A POLICY, DEVELOPMENT
PLANS, AND RESOURCES REQUIRED. THE FINNISH SP EAKER DEALT MAINLY WITH SPECIAL
LIBRARIES.

CORPORATE MANAGEMENT OF PATENTS' ROLE OF THE INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF 2 SURVEYS CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHOR' IN THE 1ST, 4
MAJOR US LIBRARY SCHOOLS WERE QUESTIONNED ON THEIR APPROACH TO PATENT
INFORMATION TEACHING AND IN THE 2ND, SEVERAL DOZEN MAJOR US INDUSTRIAL
LIBRARIES WERE ASKED ABOUT PATENT HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
OVER 30 PATENT DEPOSITORIES IN THE USA, THE AVERAGE RESEARCH LIBRARIAN DOES
NOT MAKE COMPLETE USE OF THEM AND, IN SOME CASES, IS EVEN UNAWARE OF THESE
DATA SOURCES. DESCRIBES THE MANAGEMENT AND USE OF PATENTS IN THE GENERAL
ELECTRIC COMPANY; ON-LINE PATENT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS; AND HOW
LIBRARIES MIGHT RETRIEVE PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS BEFORE THE END OF
THIS CENTURY.

ESTABLISHED BY THE EPO (JANUARY 1981).

53,713 REPORTS OF OFFICIAL SEARCHES CARRIED OUT FOR THE EUROPEAN PATENT
OFFICE, THE NATIONAL PATENT OFFICES OF FRANCE, SWITZERLAND, AND THE
NETHERLANDS, AND STANDARD SEARCHES WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYSED TO DETERMINE
WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO LIMIT THE SEARCHES TO DOCUMENTS FROM A
CERTAIN COUNTRY, TO PATENT DOCUMENTS ONLY, OR TO CERTAIN TIME SPANS ONLY. IT
SEEMS THAT IN CERTAIN FIELDS (SUCH AS MECHANICS) THE SEARCH COULD DISREGARD
NON-PATENT LITERATURE, BUT ALL OTHER LIMITATIONS SEEM TO RESULT IN A LOSS OF
INFORMATION.
USE OF PATENT INFORMATION AT A CZECHOSLOVAK RESEARCH INSTITUTE.

DESCRIBES PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, THE ROLE OF THE
CENTRAL LIBRARY OF PATENT LITERATURE (PART OF THE OFFICE FOR INVENTIONS AND

THE PATENT SYSTEM AND THE MEDIUM-SIZED INDUSTRY.

SHORTENED VERSION OF A LECTURE AT THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SMALL AND
MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (ISSB SYMPOSIUM), BERLIN, 30 OCT 79. THE MAJORITY OF
PATENT APPLICATIONS IN WEST GERMANY ARE FILED BY SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED
INDUSTRIES (SMI) OR PRIVATE INVENTORS. MANY SMI, HOWEVER, DO NOT MAKE FULL USE
OF THE PROTECTION OFFERED BY PATENTING AND THEY HAVE ONLY RECENTLY
ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENT LITERATURE AS A SOURCE OF TECHNICAL
INFORMATION. ANALYSES SOME EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS; OUTLINES THE ADVANTAGES OF
PATENT PROTECTION; AND CONCLUDES THAT THE WEST GERMAN PATENT OFFICE SHOULD
MAKE ACCESS TO ITS STOCK OF INFORMATION EASIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE.
COLLECTIONS OF PATENT DOCUMENTATION AND THE WAY SOVIET SPECIALISTS NEED THEM.

THE SOVIET PATENT DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM COMPRISES COLLECTIONS AT 4 LEVELS' THE
VERY COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF THE ALL-UNION PATENT-TECHNICAL LIBRARY
(VPTB); INDUSTRY BRANCH ORIENTED FILES; REGIONAL FILES; AND LOCAL FILES OF
ORGANISATIONS AND FACTORIES. THE VPTB FILES FORM THE BASIS FOR PRODUCING
RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE ABSTRACTS OF FOREIGN INVENTIONS, FOR MICROFILMING INDUSTRIAL
DESIGNS AND UTILITY MODELS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES, AND FOR ISSUING VARIOUS
REFERENCE AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PUBLICATIONS. THE PATENT FILE SYSTEM IS
BEING IMPROVED CONTINUOUSLY. THE PHILOSOPHY GOVERNING THIS AND TECHNIQUES FOR
SELECTING FOREIGN PATENT DOCUMENTS FOR ACQUISITION ARE DESCRIBED.

CONTEXT.
LIBRARIES AND VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.

ATTEMPTS TO OUTLINE POSSIBLE MODELS FOR LIBRARIES WHICH MIGHT STRENGTHEN THEIR
CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL VILLAGES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
DISCUSSES 2 PARTICULAR MODELS-THE LIBRARY EXTENSION MODEL (THE TAKING OF
EXISTING LIBRARY SERVICES INTO THE COMMUNITY); AND THE VILLAGE INFORMATION
CENTRE MODEL (AN INFORMATION ORGANISATION LOCATED IN A GEOGRAPHIC AREA
SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO ASSIST VILLAGERS AND PROFESSIONAL FIELDWORKERS TO
DEVELOP THAT PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA).
COMMUNITY INFORMATION IN MOBILE LIBRARIES.

THE USE OF MOBILE INFORMATION VANS IN THE UK IS GROWING MAINLY IN URBAN AREAS,
ALTHOUGH IT IS IN THE RURAL AREAS THAT THE DEARTH OF INFORMATION AND ADVICE IS
MOST ACUTE. SMALL VANS OFFER CLIENTS LITTLE PRIVACY AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
FOR SOCIAL SERVICES HAS RECOMMENDED THE USE OF LARGE MULTIPURPOSE VANS SUCH AS
TRAVELLING LIBRARIES. THIS HAS POSSIBILITIES AND AN EXPERIMENTAL
LIBRARY/INFORMATION VEHICLE (A CONVERTED BUS) IS BEING TRIED IN BRADFORD.
PROBLEMS INCLUDE LACK OF SPACE, PARTICULARLY WHERE LOCAL GEOGRAPHY
NECESSITATES SMALL MOBILE LIBRARIES. IN SUCH CASES, LEAFLETS COULD BE KEPT IN
THE CAB.

FOLLOWING A PREVIOUS STUDY CONCERNED WITH THE MONITORING OF INFORMATION FLOW,
AIMS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF INFORMATION IN THE PROSECUTION OF
ENGINEERING PROJECTS. FOR EACH OF 3 PROJECTS THE BACKGROUND OF POTENTIALLY
USEFUL INFORMATION WAS EXPLORED AND COMPARED WITH THE INFORMATION ACTUALLY
BEING USED. IN GENERAL NO VAST AMOUNT OF IMMEDIATELY USEFUL INFORMATION WAS
FOUND, MUCH OF THE INFORMATION USED DERIVING FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ENGINEER'S
OWN TRAINING AND RESOURCES. THE INFORMATION FLOW WAS REGARDED AS ADEQUATE FOR
THE PRACTICAL PURPOSES OF THE PROJECTS. HOWEVER, AWARENESS OF RESEARCH
INFORMATION POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR THE LONG RANGE PLANNING WAS LIMITED, THE
MAIN OBSTACLES TO INFORMATION FLOW OF THIS TYPE BEING MANAGEMENT ATTITUDES AND
ORGANISATIONAL CONSTRAINTS.

DEVELOPMENTS AT THE RUTHERFORD AND APPLETON LABORATORIES LIBRARY.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT THE LIBRARY INCLUDE COM CATALOGUES, AND THE USE OF AERE
(HARWELL)'S TEXT RETRIEVAL SOFTWARE PACKAGE STATUS, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN SOME
DETAIL. STATUS WAS ALREADY ON SITE, SO (HOPEFULLY) NO OTHER COSTS WOULD BE
INCURRED, LOCAL EXPERTISE WITH PRIME HARDWARE WAS AVAILABLE, AND OTHER LIBRARY
SYSTEMS WERE ALREADY USING STATUS SO IT COULD BE ASSUMED THAT SOME OF THE
INITIAL PROBLEMS HAD ALREADY BEEN SOLVED ELSEWHERE.
A SCIENTIFIC DATA BASE FOR THE ROYAL AIRCRAFT ESTABLISHMENT, FARNBOROUGH.

AFTER SPECIFYING THE DATA HANDLING PROBLEMS WITHIN THE ESTABLISHMENT, DETAILS
ARE GIVEN OF A SCIENTIFIC DATA BASE WHICH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR USE BY
SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. A SPECIFIC PROBLEM FROM THE
AERODYNAMICS FIELD IS DESCRIBED AND USED AS AN EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATING THE
APPLICATION OF THE DATA BASE.
AUTOMATED ADDITIVE MODELING TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTY
ESTIMATION.

AUTOMATED ADDITIVE MODELING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATION OF
HEATS OF VAPORISATION. COMPUTER-READABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF CHEMICAL
STRUCTURES WERE ANALYSED ALGORITHMICALLY TO DERIVE STRUCTURAL GROUPINGS TO BE
USED IN THE MODEL. THESE WERE THEN INPUT AS VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION
ANALYSES, WHICH GAVE THE GROUP CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE USED IN ESTIMATION. THE
METHOD GAVE GOOD ESTIMATIONS FOR VARIOUS STRUCTURAL TYPES AND COULD BE APPLIED
TO A VARIETY OF THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES.
COMPUTER-AIDED SPECTRAL IDENTIFICATION OF LASER-INDUCED PLASMA EMMISSION.

THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELECTRONIC EMISSION SPECTRA PRODUCED BY A LASER-INDUCED
PLASMA MAY BE PERFORMED BY COMPUTER ANALYSIS. PRESENTS 2 ALGORITHMS FOR
MATCHING SUCH SPECTRA AGAINST STANDARD TABLES. THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCIES OF
THE 2 ALGORITHMS ARE ANALYSED.
THEORY OF CORRELATION TABLES. 1.

A POSSIBLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS PRESENTED FOR CORRELATION TABLES USED IN
SPECTROSCOPY. A PROCESS BASED ON INFORMATION THEORY IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE OPTIMUM CONSTRUCTION OF CORRELATION TABLES. IN THIS EXAMPLE
THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN NMR CORRELATION TABLE IS INVESTIGATED; THE METHOD IS
GENERAL AND IS SUITABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CORRELATION TABLES USED IN
COMPUTERISED EVALUATION OF SPECTRA.
THEORY OF CORRELATION TABLES. 2.

A PROCESS HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE OPTIMISATION OF SPECTROSCOPICAL CORRELATION
TABLES CONTAINING COMPLEX PRIMARY AND SUBFRAGMENTS. THE METHOD IS BASED ON
INFORMATION THEORY AND PROVIDES THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE USEFULNESS
OF ANY CHANGE WITHIN A GIVEN CORRELATION TABLE. IN THIS WAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IT
SHOWS IN WHICH CASE IT IS EXPEDIENT TO SPECIALISE A FRAGMENT AND ALSO WHEN IT
IS WORTH DRAWING TOGETHER SEVERAL SUBFRAGMENTS INTO ONE FRAGMENT. THE PROCESS
CAN EASILY BE EXPRESSED AS A COMPUTER ALGORITHM, AND IN THIS WAY IT CAN BE
USEFUL FOR A SET OF COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS FOR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.

PROTOTYPE.
THE GENERATION OF INTEGRATED PUBLIC TRANSPORT TRAVEL INFORMATION BY COMPUTER.

THE EXISTING PROCEDURES UTILISED BY TRAVEL ENQUIRY CLERKS, WHEN ANSWERING
INQUIRIES ON JOURNEYS INVOLVING INTERCHANGE, ARE OFTEN CUMBERSOME AND
SOMETIMES SLOW. THE USE OF A COMPUTER TO COMPILE TRAVEL INFORMATION WOULD THUS
APPEAR TO BE OF BENEFIT TO TRAVELLERS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS ALIKE BY
PROVIDING THE FACILITIES FOR QUICKER, MORE ACCURATE AND CONSISTENT RESPONSES
TO INQUIRERS. THE PRACTICABILITY OF PRODUCING COMPUTER SOFTWARE THAT WOULD
GENERATE SCHEDULES OF TRIP-OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT TIMETABLES
WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE TRANSPORT AND ROAD RESEARCH LABORATORY. (SEE ALSO
80/2217).

THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

DESCRIBES AND PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF THE URBAN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (URBIS)
PROJECT, CARRIED OUT IN 1973-78 BY THE URBIS RESEARCH GROUP OF THE PUBLIC
POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE. THE PROJECT'S
PURPOSE WAS TO ASSESS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMPUTING,
EVALUATE ITS IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING, AND
DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE BETTER USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
COMPUTING IN OVER 700 US CITIES AND COUNTIES WAS STUDIED EXTENSIVELY AND MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION WAS THEN COLLECTED IN 42 CITIES. IT WAS FOUND THAT
WELL-MANAGED COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY HAS REAL PAY-OFFS, BUT THAT IT WAS NOT
WELL-MANAGED IN MOST CITIES, CREATING PERVASIVE PROBLEMS AND PRODUCING
BENEFITS FAR SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINDATA, A CLINICAL TRIAL DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

DESCRIBES THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CLINICAL TRIAL DATA MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM AT THE WELLCOME RESEARCH LABORATORIES. BASED ON AN IBM 3031 COMPUTER,

THE USER EDUCATION PROGRAMME AT THE GOROKA TEACHERS COLLEGE LIBRARY, PAPUA NEW
GUINEA, COMPRISES 2 PARTS, OFFERED IN THE 1ST TERM OF EACH YEAR, AND
COMPULSORY FOR ALL NEW COLLEGE ENTRANTS' (1) DURING ORIENTATION WEEK, AN
INTRODUCTION TO THE LIBRARY IS GIVEN, CONSISTING OF A TOUR OF BOTH LIBRARY AND
MEDIA RESOURCES CENTRE; AND (2) A 9-WEEK (ONE HOUR PER WEEK) COURSE IN LIBRARY
SKILLS IS GIVEN, INCLUDING LECTURES ON USE OF THE CATALOGUE, DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION REFERENCE BOOKS, AND INFORMATION SEARCH TECHNIQUES. A PRACTICAL
ASSIGNMENT FOLLOWS EACH CLASSROOM HOUR, AND A MARKED FINAL ASSIGNMENT
COMPLETES THE COURSE. AN IN-SERVICE COURSE IN ENGLISH AND LIBRARY STUDIES IS
PLANNED.
LIBRARY LITERACY: WHO? WHEN? WHERE?.

THE PROBLEM OF INADEQUATE LIBRARY EDUCATION IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS
HAS FAR-REACHING RESULTS. ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS MUST TEACH STUDENTS THE BASICS
OF LIBRARY USE BEFORE EMBARKING ON COURSE-RELATED INSTRUCTION-ALL IN A VERY
SHORT TIME AND WITH REDUCED SUCCESS. SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE
WORK FORCE-THE VERY PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED AND COULD BEST PROFIT FROM
LIBRARIES-WILL NEVER HAVE EFFECTIVE LIBRARY ACCESS. THIS MAKES THE LIVES OF
MANY POORER AND MORE DIFFICULT; DENIES THEM SOME MEASURE OF SATISFACTION,
SUCCESS, AND HAPPINESS; AND ERODES SOCIETY'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CRITICAL
PROBLEMS AND GOVERN ITSELF. CHILDREN MUST LEARN READING, WRITING, ARITHMETIC,
AND LIBRARY USE TOGETHER.
LIBRARY IN-SERVICE PROGRAM FOR TEACHERS.

PRESENTS THE MATERIAL GIVEN TO ALL NEW TEACHERS BY THE LIBRARIAN OF ST. MARY'S
DOMINICAN HIGH SCHOOL, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA; ALL NEW TEACHERS SPEND 4 HOURS

PROVIDES STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURES FOR SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHING THE LITERATURE
AND GATHERING PUBLISHED INFORMATION FOR A RESEARCH OR TERM PAPER. THE CONCEPTS
OF LITERATURE SEARCH, SEARCH STRATEGY, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INFORMATION
SOURCES, AND TOPIC SELECTION ARE EXPLAINED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CONTINUING) EDUCATION IN HANDLING SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION' A NECESSITY FOR A
(WISE) EDUCATION POLICY.A

 SURVEY HELD IN THE NETHERLANDS IN 1979 SHOWED THAT LESS THAN 50% OF
RECENTLY-GRADUATED STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO PERFORM LITERATURE SEARCHES IN THEIR
OWN SUBJECTS EFFECTIVELY. THE PROBLEM WAS RECOGNISED IN 1973 BY THE COMMISSIE
ALGEMENE VRAAGSTUKKEN UNIVERSITAIR BIBLIOTHEEKWEZEN (COMMITTEE ON GENERAL
AFFAIRS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES) WHICH RECOMMENDED COURSES OF INSTRUCTION BE
GIVEN TO STUDENTS IN THE USE OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. MORE
RECENTLY THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT IN A POLICY DOCUMENT ISSUED IN 1980 RECOGNISED
THE GROWING NEED FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN A MODERN, HIGHLY-INDUSTRIALISED
AND COMPLEX SOCIETY. PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO PROVIDING COURSES IN LIBRARY
INSTRUCTION IN BOTH SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES TO ENABLE EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE
FULLY IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE.
TRAINING IN HANDLING SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION' AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
COURSE MATERIAL.

ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PUBLISHED SOURCES OF INFORMATION
USED IN COURSES OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE
NETHERLANDS.
A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIO COURSE ON THE USE OF THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE.

THE RATIONALE FOR, DEVELOPMENT OF, AND ORGANISATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIO
COURSE ON THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL
SOCIETY ARE DESCRIBED. THE STRUCTURE OF THE COURSE IS BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS
OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION ACTIVITIES OF INDIVIDUALS BY ARNETT (71/1062) IN WHICH
TYPES OF SEARCHES ARE MATCHED TO APPROPRIATE PRINTED AS WELL AS
COMPUTER-READABLE CHEMICAL INFORMATION SOURCES. THE COURSE FEATURES VISUAL
PRESENTATIONS OF TYPICAL PUBLICATION CONTENT, DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS
PARTICULARLY OF SECONDARY LITERATURE SOURCES, AND IDENTIFICATION OF USER AIDS.
MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A LIBRARY SKILLS PROGRAM.

THE IMPACT OF AN INTRODUCTORY LIBRARY SKILLS COURSE IS EVALUATED THROUGH THE
USE OF A DIFFERENCE OF MEANS TEST. THE PURPOSE OF THE COURSE IS TO PROVIDE A
BASIC INTRODUCTION TO THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
AND THEIR RESOURCES. EACH OF 55 UNDERGRADUATES WAS PRE-TESTED TO DETERMINE
HIS/HER ENTRY LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. THE TEST AND THE COURSE COVERED COMPETENCY
AREAS' TERMINOLOGY, CARD CATALOGUE, SUBJECT HEADING, HEADING ARRANGEMENT,
REFERENCE MATERIALS, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION, CHOICE OF INDEX AND
PERIODICAL INDEXES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
A MANUAL FOR THE EVALUATION OF CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETINS.

BASED ON THE EVALUATION OF 2 CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETINS (2SOCIAL WORK
INFORMATION BULLETIN1 AND 2LORIS BULLETIN1) IN 8 UK LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND A
UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT. INCLUDES DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON ESTABLISHING COSTS,
COLLECTING USE-DATA, AND CARRYING OUT SURVEYS. THE SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES AND
INTERVIEW SCHEDULES HAVE BEEN PILOT-TESTED AND REVISED AND EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN
OF THE KIND OF DATA OBTAINED. COMPUTER ROUTINES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF USE-DATA
AND SURVEY-DATA ARE PROVIDED, PARTLY IN THE FORM OF STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR
THE SOCIAL SCIENCES INSTRUCTIONS, AND PARTLY IN THE FORM OF SPECIALLY WRITTEN
COBOL PROGRAMMES.
SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF SDI SYSTEMS (EXPERIENCE OF THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY).

DISCUSSES THE SDI SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY. THE
SYSTEM IS USED TO PROVIDE SDI TO 2 MAIN GROUPS OF USERS' SCIENTISTS AND
MANAGEMENT OFFICERS. AS FAR AS THE 1ST USER GROUP IS CONCERNED THE OPERATION
OF THE SDI SERVICE IS SUCCESSFUL. IN 1978, OUT OF THE 150,000 SDI ITEMS SENT
OUT, ONLY 15% WERE RETURNED BY THE USERS AS IRRELEVANT. AS FAR AS THE LATTER
USER GROUP IS CONCERNED, THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE INFORMATION CENTRE AND THE
MEMBERS OF THE GROUP IS NOT SATISFACTORY. A SURVEY OF THE SDI REQUIREMENTS WAS
THEREFORE CARRIED OUT. RESULTS ARE PRESENTED.
UNITED STATES SECONDARY INFORMATION SERVICES IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND
ENGINEERING' EVOLUTION AND TRENDS FROM SPUTNIK TO NIXON.

(DLS THESIS-CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA, WASHINGTON, DC.) IDENTIFIES,
ANALYSES, AND EVALUATES MAJOR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE EVOLUTION OF US
SECONDARY INFORMATION SERVICES AND THEIR PRODUCERS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND
ENGINEERING, 1957-71. KEY PERSONNEL AT 4 PRODUCERS (H.W. WILSON, ENGINEERING
INDEX, INC., US ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION, AND THE INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION) HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED AND SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS (2APPLIED
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INDEX, ENGINEERING INDEX, NUCLEAR SCIENCE ABSTRACTS1,
AND 2SCIENCE CITATION INDEX1) HAVE BEEN ANALYSED IN DETAIL.
HISTORY OF ABSTRACTING AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

THE EVOLUTION OF ABSTRACTS AND ABSTRACTING FOR 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 FROM 1907
TO THE PRESENT IS TRACED. THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING, CHANGES IN THE
CONTENT, FORM, FORMAT, NATIONAL ORIGIN, AND LANGUAGE OF PRIMARY DOCUMENTS, THE
SHIFT FROM A LARGE CORPS OF VOLUNTEER ABSTRACTORS TO IN-HOUSE DOCUMENT
ANALYSTS, AND THE TRANSITION TO MODERN COMPUTER PROCESSING HAVE ALL AFFECTED
THE PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION OF 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1.
CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS (IN ARABIC).

DESCRIBES 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL
ASSOCIATION, IN TERMS OF ITS FORMAT, LAYOUT AND THE USE OF ITS INDEXES.
THE ACCURACY OF TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES IN THE SOUTHEAST' A CASE FOR
QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS.

THE TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES IN THE 9 SOUTHEASTERN STATES OF THE USA WERE INVESTIGATED USING
THEIR RESPONSES TO 12 FACT-SEEKING TELEPHONE QUERIES MADE OVER A 12-MONTH
PERIOD, THEIR 1975 LIBRARY GENERAL INFORMATION SURVEY DATA, AND A
QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES RELATED TO REFERENCE
SERVICES. ONLY 50% OF THE TEST QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED CORRECTLY. INDEPENDENT
VARIABLES SUCH AS SERVICE HOURS OR VOLUMES HELD WERE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO
ACCURACY OF RESPONSE THAN VARIABLES CONCERNED WITH STAFF, INDICATING THAT
STAFF ABILITY TO EXPLOIT A COLLECTION IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN STAFF NUMBERS.
CONCLUDES THAT THESE RESULTS SUPPORT CALLS FOR QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS FOR
REFERENCE SERVICES.
MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE TRANSACTIONS' AN IN-DEPTH STATISTICAL STUDY OF DEMAND
AND CAPACITY IN TWENTY-TWO LIBRARIES OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.

DESCRIBES A STUDY OF THE VOLUME OF REFERENCE TRANSACTIONS IN OHIO STATE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM'S DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES IN 1977 AND 1978. DISCUSSES
THE RESULTS AND CONCLUDES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE VOLUME OF
REFERENCE QUESTIONS WITH SOME ACCURACY AND THAT MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF
THE TOTALS CAN BE MADE.
REFERENCE UPDATE. HOW OLD IS IT AND HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?.

IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE USA HAS 22 MILLION 'COLLECTORS OF ONE KIND OR
ANOTHER, MOSTLY ANOTHER'. ALL WANT TO FIND A FORTUNE IN THEIR ATTIC AND,
SOONER OR LATER, MOST COME TO THE LIBRARY TO PROVE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THEIR
TREASURE. SUGGESTS SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES WHICH THE LIBRARIAN CAN
CONSULT TO DISCOVER THE AGE AND VALUE OF THE COLLECTIONS.
MANAGERIAL RATING' A LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MODEL.

IN NOV 71, AN AD-HOC COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
WAS ASKED TO DETERMINE IF EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES COULD BE APPLIED TO REFERENCE
ACTIVITIES AND, IF SO, TO PROPOSE SOME METHOD FOR COLLECTING THE NECESSARY
DATA. SEVERAL EFFECTIVENESS MODELS WERE STUDIED AND DISCARDED. THE COMMITTEE
THEN TRIED THE MANAGERIAL RATING MODEL, WHEREBY MANAGERS MEET TO IDENTIFY
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, THEN RECONVENE AFTER A GIVEN TIME TO RATE THEIR LEVELS
OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. A TRIAL INDICATED THAT THIS MODEL WAS SUITABLE AND THE
COMMITTEE REPORTED ACCORDINGLY, BUT NO FULL TRIAL EVER TOOK PLACE AND THE
COMMITTEE WAS DISBANDED. SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE METHOD'S POSSIBLE
DISADVANTAGES AND A LACK OF INTEREST.
ANALYZING THE AVAILABILITY OF REFERENCE SERVICES.

THE KEY TO THE OBJECTIVE BRANCHING ANALYSIS OF REFERENCE SERVICES IS THE
IDENTIFICATION OF A CHAIN OF ESSENTIALLY INDEPENDENT CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BE
MET FOR A PATRON TO OBTAIN THE SERVICE REQUIRED. EXPLORES THE PROBLEMS
INVOLVED IN SUCH IDENTIFICATION, ILLUSTRATING EACH PROBLEM WITH DATA COLLECTED
FROM 16 LIBRARIES IN THE LORCOST PROJECT (LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COSTS OF
OPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES, A 2-YEAR STUDY TO COLLECT
PRIMARY INFORMATION FROM 50 SUCH LIBRARIES) WHICH ELECTED TO COLLECT DATA ON
REFERENCE SERVICE AVAILABILITY.
MEASUREMENT OF REFERENCE SERVICE' REFERENCE STATISTICS 1978/79' UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.

THE TYPES OF STATISTICS NEEDED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF A REFERENCE PROGRAMME
IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY WERE INVESTIGATED BY COLLECTING DATA ON VARIABLES SUCH
AS PEAK TIMES OF HEAVIST REFERENCE USE, TYPE OF REFERENCE QUESTIONS, TIME
SPENT IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS, TYPE OF EMPLOYEE ANSWERING QUESTIONS, ADEQUACY
OF RESPONSES, REASONS FOR INADEQUATE ANSWERS, AND WHETHER PROFESSIONAL STAFF
WERE ANSWERING THE MORE SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA
INDICATED THAT SUCH INFORMATION COULD BE USED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF AN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICE AND THAT A STANDARDISED DATA FORM COULD BE
USED FOR BOTH GENERAL REFERENCE SERVICE AND REFERENCE SERVICE IN A SPECIALISED
SUBJECT AREA.
TEST STUDIES OF THE REFERENCE SERVICES OF GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

IN AUTUMN 79 A STUDY OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
CARRIED OUT. A RESEARCHER POSED AS A LIBRARY USER AT SELECTED LIBRARIES AND
ANSWERS HE RECEIVED TO REFERENCE QUERIES WERE THEN EVALUATED FOR
COMPREHENSIVENESS AND ACCURACY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS NOT TO ASSESS THE
QUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICES OR TO SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIES; INSTEAD IT DEMONSTRATES A NEW METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN PRODUCE DATA
BEYOND THE MERELY QUANTITATIVE DATA WHICH PREVIOUSLY COULD BE INTERPRETED, FOR
THE MOST PART, FROM LIBRARY STATISTICS.
DOCUMENT DELIVERY: A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SURVEY.

THE TERM DOCUMENT DELIVERY ENCOMPASSES VARIOUS FORMS OF PROVIDING PRIMARY
DOCUMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED IN BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND BY SDI
SERVICES. DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICES NOTIFY THE USERS OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF
OBTAINING THE PRIMARY SOURCES IN THE FORM OF PHOTOCOPIES OF PERIODICAL
ARTICLES AND BY INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN THE CASE OF BOOKS. FROM 19 REFERENCES TO
LITERATURE DEALING WITH THIS FORM OF DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, 5 ARE OF
CZECH ORIGIN, THE REST DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE 'UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS' PROGRAMME AND SYSTEMS SUCH AS 'THE MAIL DROP' SERVICES AND
'ORIGINAL ARTICLE TEAR SHEET'. PAPERS BY AUTHORS SUCH AS P.D. GILLESPIE, M.B.
LINE AND F.W. LANCASTER ARE CITED.
AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES A METHOD DEVELOPED AT THE PRINCE WILLIAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, MANASSAS,
VIRGINIA, FOR MEASURING THE RATE OF AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS SOUGHT BY THE
PUBLIC FROM ITS COLLECTIONS. RELATES THIS METHOD TO TRADITIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARY
STANDARDS AND PREVIOUS AVAILABILITY RESEARCH. AVAILABILITY RATE COULD BE USED
AS A PERFORMANCE STANDARD, MEASURING QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERED AND
INDICATING A LIBRARY'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.
LONGITUDINAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY.

REVIEWS 6 EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF BOOK AVAILABILITY CONDUCTED AT THE 2 MAJOR
LIBRARIES OF CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO-THE SEARS LIBRARY (PHYSICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMICS) AND THE
FREIBERGER LIBRARY (SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES). THE
STUDIES SHOW HOW CERTAIN MANAGEMENT DECISIONS HAVE INFLUENCED BOOK
AVAILABILITY IN THESE LIBRARIES AND HOW CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, OVER WHICH
MANAGEMENT HAD LITTLE CONTROL, HAVE COMPROMISED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BOOK
AVAILABILITY.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION.

LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ON
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TO
BE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,
NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BE
SUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THE
LIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,
OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
IS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC IN
BROADER BASED JOURNALS.
PROGRAMMING WITH A PURPOSE.

EXAMINES THE RATIONALE FOR LIBRARY-SPONSORED PROGRAMMES AND CONTENDS THAT
LIBRARIES MUST ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMMES ARE PLANNED AND PURSUED IN TERMS
OF A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE AND THAT THEY GIVE SUFFICIENT RETURN FOR THE TIME AND
EFFORT INVESTED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE FACE OF SHRINKING
BUDGETS AND REDUCED STAFF. (PAPER REPRINTED FROM 2LIBRARY PR NEWS1, 1979).
CULTURE IN HEDEMORA-A CHALLENGE.

DESCRIBES THE CULTURAL LIFE OF A SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITY, HEDEMORA (SWEDEN).
REMARKS ON THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE AS OUTLINED IN THE OFFICIAL PROGRAMME, WHERE
THE DREAMS ARE PUT FORWARD, AND WARNS AGAINST EXPANDING IT INTO ABSURDITY.
DIVIDES THE CONCEPT INTO' POPULAR AND AMATEUR CULTURE, NURTURED BY SOCIETIES
AND STUDY CIRCLES AND EXEMPLIFIED BY BIENNIAL ART EXHIBITIONS, AN ANTHOLOGY OF
POEMS, CRAFT DEMONSTRATIONS AND MUSICAL EVENTS DURING THE SUMMER; HIGH
CULTURE, AS REPRESENTED BY THE DRAMA, ART AND CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETIES AND THE
LIBRARY WHICH AIM TO PRESERVE THE CULTURAL HERITAGE; AND CHILDREN'S CULTURE.
THIS ASPECT IS NEGLECTED AS THE LIBRARY HAS A POOR CHILDREN'S SECTION AND NO
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ACTIVITIES (IN ARABIC).

LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AIM TO ENCOURAGE AND ENLIVEN LIBRARY USE. READINGS AND
TALKS HAVE BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE, AND OTHER
ACTIVITIES INCLUDE STORY HOURS, DRAMA, QUIZZES, COMPETITIONS AND READING
PROGRAMMES. THESE MOTIVATE READING AND ORIENTATE CHILDREN WITHIN THE LIBRARY.
NON-BOOK MATERIALS CAN ALSO BE A MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARY
ACTIVITIES.
SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.

BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTEN
DISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCE
STRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONAL
BOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELY
AGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN
ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USE
VARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONAL
OBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOST
EFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENT
DOES NOT EXIST. IN DETERMINING IF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT HAS A PLACE IN A
PARTICULAR LIBRARY ORGANISATION, LIBRARY PLANNERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED A BOUT
NATURAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND SHOULD TRY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN
COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS.
ADLIB FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.

LMR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, MAIDENHEAD, ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THEIR SOFTWARE
PACKAGE ADLIB (ADAPTIVE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM), A TOOL FOR STORING AND
MANIPULATING BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WITH A VARIED SELECTION OF MODULES
AVAILABLE FOR PERFORMING DIFFERENT OPERATIONS. PRESENTS A BROAD DESCRIPTION OF
THE TYPES OF OPERATION WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT. THE 2 BASIC FUNCTIONS OF
ADLIB ARE THE CATALOGUING AND RETIREVAL MODULES AND THE SYSTEM CAN BE BUILT UP
FROM THERE BY THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY USING ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING'
CONTROLLED LANGUAGE AND AUTHORITY LIST FILES, THESAURUS MANAGEMENT MODULE,
CIRCULATION CONTROL MODULE, ORDER MODULE, WORD PROCESSING MODULE AND MARC TAPE
PROCESSOR.
WILTSHIRE LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICE' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM.

DISCUSSES THE PROGRESS MADE BY WILTSHIRE'S LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICE IN
AUTOMATING ITS CATALOGUING AND CIRCULATION SYSTEM. THE SERVICE REJECTED MARC
RECORDS AND CREATED ITS OWN PROGRAMMES AND FILES. RETROSPECTIVE CATALOGUE
CONVERSION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM COMPRISES A PLESSEY
SATELLITE AND OPERATES IN BATCH MODE AT THE COUNTY'S 6 BUSIEST BRANCHES EACH
OF WHICH HAS AT LEAST 1 ISSUE, DISCHARGE AND COMPOSITE TERMINAL. THE FULL
RANGE OF HOUSEKEEPING REPORTS AND STATISTICS CAN BE GENERATED. A KWOC INDEX IS
CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED TO ASSIST WITH TITLE REQUESTS AND MOST OF THE
SUBJECT QUERIES.
AUTOMATION AT THE LIBRARY OF THE SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.

AFTER DESCRIBING THE BACKGROUND AND STAFFING OF THE LIBRARY, GIVES DETAILS OF
THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED FOR THE AUTOMATED HOUSEKEEPING AND RETRIEVAL
SYSTEMS. THE LIBRARY IS NOW CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ACQUIRE A DEDICATED
COMPUTER FOR A NEW INTEGRATED SYSTEM, WITH ALL PARTS INTERACTIVELY ON-LINE.
NORTH YORKSHIRE LIBRARY ON-LINE SYSTEM.

NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL, FORMED IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION
IN 1974, IS AN AMALGAMATION OF ALL OR PART OF 7 FORMERLY INDEPENDANT LIBRARY
SERVICES. IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO STANDARDISE THEIR WORK METHODS SO AUTOMATION WAS
INTRODUCED AT THE TIME OF REORGANISATION. THE AIM OF THE AUTOMATION WAS TO
PROVIDE A CENTRAL CONTROL OF THE NORTH YORKSHIRE LIBRARY BOOKSTOCK AND TO
PRODUCE A CATALOGUE OF THE COUNTY STOCK. IT WAS DECIDED TO USE THE BRITISH
LIBRARY MARC RECORDS AS THE BASIS FOR THE CATALOGUE INFORMATION. DESCRIBES THE
INSTALLATION OF AN ICL 1904S COMPUTER IN 1976 FOLLOWED BY AN ICL 2976 IN 1979
AND TIMETABLES THE MAJOR EVENTS OF THE AUTOMATION PROCESS FROM 1976/80.
DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM.

DESCRIBES A PROJECT WHICH TAKES A STEP-BY-STEP OR INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AN ON-LINE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM RUNNING ON A DEDICATED
COMPUTER. THE DESIGN SUGGESTED PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO PRESENT AND
PREDICTED CAPABILITIES IN COMPUTING AS WELL AS TO TRENDS IN LIBRARY
AUTOMATION. THE RESULTANT SYSTEM IS NOW IN ITS 2ND OF 3 RELEASES, HAVING TIED
TOGETHER CIRCULATION CONTROL, CATALOGUE ACCESS AND SERIAL HOLDINGS.
STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT' DATA INPUT FOR LIBRARIES.

REPORT PRODUCED TO PROVIDE PRESENT AND POTENTIAL INFORONICS CUSTOMERS WITH AN
OVERVIEW OF TECHNIQUES OF DATA INPUT (FOR CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY,
INFORMATION AND REFERENCE WORK). EACH PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED AND AN ESTIMATE
OF PROCESSING COSTS IS GIVEN. A FINAL SECTION DEALS WITH SPECIAL PROCEDURES
FOR ENCODING BACKLOGS OF DATA WHEN CONVERTING A LARGE DATA FILE TO A
MECHANISED SYSTEM.
SERIAL CONTROL IN A DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEM.

ARGUES THAT THE DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE BASED ON
PRESENT LINEAR MACHINE RECORDS, BUT WILL OPERATE UPON A COMPLEX NETWORK OF
SIMPLE RECORDS. SUCH A NETWORK WILL HAVE SPECIAL APPLICATION TO THE PROBLEMS
RELATING TO THE CONTROL OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON SERIALS. THE PROBLEMS
OF CHRONOLOGICAL AND HIERARCHICAL LINKAGE OF SERIALS ARE ANALYSED AND RELATED
TO THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL ALSO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL
EFFECTS FOR SERIALS CHECK IN, SERIALS CATALOGUING, AND CATALOGUE USERS.
THE METHODS AND PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION IN THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES.

A TALK GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING. EXAMINES THE
LITERATURE AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT OF ACQUISITION. MUCH OF THIS RESULTS FROM
SEMINARS AND CONFERENCES. 1 OF THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE AREA OF ACQUISITION
IS UNWANTED DUPLICATES. DOUBLE ACQUISITION MAY BE CAUSED BY MONOGRAPHS WHICH
HAVE ALREADY BEEN ORDERED AS PART OF A SERIES. CHOICE OF BOOKSELLER IS ALSO
CRUCIAL. OTHER PROBLEMS CONCERN CALCULATION OF PRICE INCREASES AND THE USE OF
EXCHANGES. THE MECHANISATION OF ROUTINES, SUCH AS CATALOGUING AND ACCOUNTING
AND THE AUTOMATION OF BOOKSELLERS' DATA HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ACQUISITION. NEW
TENDENCIES IN PUBLISHING, SUCH AS EXCLUSIVE PUBLICATION IN MICROFORM, CAN
CAUSE PROBLEMS OF CONTROL AND RETRIEVAL. THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING PHOTOCOPYING
AND LENDING VERSUS PURCHASE ARE STILL BEING DEBATED.
CLAIMING' LUXURY OR NECESSITY?.

CLAIMING OF ORDERS IS A TIME-CONSUMING PROCEDURE WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE
NECESSARY IN THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS. EXAMINES THE CURRENT LITERATURE
RELATING TO CLAIMING, AND THEN CONCENTRATES ON SOME SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE
CLAIMING PROCESS, FOCUSING ON CLAIMS FOR MONOGRAPHS, NOT SERIALS.
DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, BIDDING AND CONTRACTS, AND GOOD OL' GIFTS.

THE FACULTY VERSUS LIBRARIANS IN THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS' A COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS.

THE ACQUISITIONS PROCESS IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITIES IS REVIEWED. A RANDOM SAMPLE
OF BOOKS ACQUIRED IN 2 YEARS' TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PORT HARCOURT LIBRARY
IN NIGERIA IS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE MAIN GENERATORS OF NEW
TITLES FOR THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION. CIRCULATION RECORDS OF THE BOOKS ARE
TRACED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING A WORKING COLLECTION MOST EFFECTIVELY
ARE MADE.
TOPOGRAPHIC MAP ACQUISITION IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RECENT SURVEY OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP ACQUISITION IN US
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND DISCUSSES THE STATUS OF, AND TRENDS IN, TOPOGRAPHICAL
MAP ACQUISITION PROGRAMMES. CONCLUDES THAT THE LEVEL OF ACQUISITION OF THIS
MAPPING IS REMARKABLY LOW COMPARED TO THE STATED DEMAND FOR IT, AND THAT THE
SITUATION REGARDING FOREIGN MATERIAL IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL. IDENTIFIES THE
MAJOR COLLECTING PROBLEMS AS' LOSS OF DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS; INADEQUATE FUNDING
SUPPORT; INFLATED MAP PRICES; INCREASED PRODUCTION; AND GOVERNMENT
RESTRICTIONS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE RESOLVED BY OBTAINING
BETTER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT THROUGH PLANNING, ORGANISED ACTION, AND
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TO
RECOGNISE THE RESOURCE VALUE OF TOPOGRAPHIC MAPPING.
A RATIONALIST'S CRITIQUE OF BOOK SELECTION FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS HAVE, HISTORICALLY, BEEN SELECTED BY THE FACULTY
OF THE INSTITUTION WHICH THEY LIBRARY SERVES. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVOLVED UPON LIBRARIANS WHO ARE
EAGER TO RETAIN AND AMPLIFY THEIR ROLE IN THIS AREA. ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN
FAVOUR OF LODGING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLITY WITH LIBRARIANS ARE,
HOWEVER, LESS THAN CONVINCING AND IGNORE IMPORTANT REALITIES TO MAKE THEIR
CASE. LIBRARIANS OFTEN CONFUSE THE ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY
FOR SUCH SELECTION. ARGUES THAT BOOK SELECTION IS MORE PROPERLY AND MORE
ADEQUATELY DONE BY FACULTY MEMBERS THAN LIBRARIANS, AND SUGGESTS A WAY OF
DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN FACULTY ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTION.
TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR PARTIAL U.S.
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.

LIBRARY LITERATURE HAS LONG IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT FOR
U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. REGIONAL DEPOSITORIES ARE NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED
BY THIS OVERSIGHT. HOWEVER, THE PARTIAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SUFFERS THE
CONSEQUENCES. OFTEN IN THE PAST, THE SOLE CRITERION FOR THE BUILDING OF A
PARTIAL DEPISITORY COLLECTION HAS BEEN ACCRETION WITHOUT REGARD FOR OTHER
SALIENT FACTORS. AT PRESENT AND IN THE FORESEABLE FUTURE, FISCAL EXIGENCY WILL
CAUSE INCREASING DEMANDS TO BE MADE ON THE LIBRARY'S BUDGET AND SPACE. IN
ORDER TO MAKE JUDICIOUS DECISIONS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE DEPOTISORY COLLECTION
TO GROW IN A MANNER RESPONSIVE TO ITS OWN NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO VARIOUS
CURRICULAR AND COMMUNITY NEEDS, A FRAMEWORK OF POLICY MUST EXIST. IT IS IN
THIS CONTEXT THAT A POLICY STATEMENT IS PRESENTED.

PURCHASING FOR LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTERS. PART IIA-BIDS AND CONTRACTS.

FOR PART 1 SEE 80/3195. LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MANAGERS HAVE BECOME
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS IN THEIR
ORGANISATIONS AS THEY HAVE WATCHED INFLATION ERODE THE PURCHASING POWER OF
THEIR BUDGETS. STAFF MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE MANAGERIAL CONCEPTS, SOME
OF WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASING PROCESS. BIDS AND CONTRACTS ARE
CONSIDERED TO BE 2 OF THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE PURCHASING PROCESS. PROVIDES A
CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF BIDS AND CONTRACTS AND A SET OF GUIDELINES FOR
COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND CONTRACTS.
TAMING THE SERIALS BUDGET.

SUGGESTS THAT UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES CAN PUT THEIR UNMANAGEABLY
OVERWEIGHT SERIALS BUDGET ON A SENSIBLE DIET BY LIMITING NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS;
ANALYSING THE SERIALS COLLECTION; PERHAPS DEVELOPING A SERIALS COLLECTION
BASED ON THE BOOK COLLECTION PROFILE; AND THEN DEVELOPING A SENSIBLE SERIALS
COLLECTION POLICY WITH THE LONG-TERM FUTURE IN MIND.
EMERGING STANDARDS FOR BOOK ACQUISITION.

DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE US BOOK INDUSTRY SYSTEMS ADVISORY COMMITTEE; THE USE
OF ITS COMPUTER-TO-COMPUTER ORDER FORMAT; THE FORMAT'S POTENTIAL; AND THE
FUTURE USE OF COMPUTERS IN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PUBLISHERS, WHOLESALERS, AND
LIBRARIES.
EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATED INTERLIBRARY LOAN.

EXAMINES THE BORROWING PATTERNS OF 15 ACADEMIC MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH CENTRAL
RESEARCH LIBRARY COUNCIL (A MULTI-TYPE LIBRARY CONSORTIUM IN CENTRAL NEW YORK
STATE), THE EFFECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OCLC/ILL SUBSYSTEM ON THEIR
INTERLIBRARY LOAN PATTERNS, AND THE TRANSITION FROM THE USE OF NYSILL (NEW
YORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOAN) TO USE OF OCLC/ILL. FINDS THAT OCLC/ILL HAS HAD
A MAJOR IMPACT-MATERIAL REQUESTED IS ARRIVING SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER, THE LOAD
ON MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES HAS BEEN REDUCED, AND SMALLER LIBRARIES CAN NOW
SHARE THE LOAD IN FILLING INTERLIBRARY LOAN TRANSACTIONS. 25-50% OF REQUESTED
MONOGRAPHS ARE LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD-PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT TO
PURCHASE THEM. RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION CONVERSION WOULD BE OF VALUE TO
INTERLIBRARY LOANS IF CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS.
STATISTICAL DETERMINATION OF BOUND VOLUME JOURNAL HOLDINGS IN A SCIENCE
LIBRARY.

DISCUSSES A METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF BOUND JOURNAL
VOLUMES IN A SCIENCE LIBRARY USING A SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. THE METHOD ALLOWS THE
CALCULATION OF THE EXTENT OF JOURNAL RUNS FOR BOTH CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT
TITLES. A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOLUMES ARRIVED AT USING THE
CURRENT STUDY METHODOLOGY AND ANOTHER INDEPENDENT STUDY SHOWS AGREEMENT WITHIN
5%. FURTHER INCIDENTAL INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY
PROVIDES INFORMATION ON OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COLLECTION.
THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. PROCEEDINGS OF A SEMINAR HELD BY THE
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT RESEARCH UNIT.

THE PURPOSE OF THE SEMINAR WAS TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUES WHICH NEED TO BE
INVESTIGATED TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED FOR FUTURE
PLANNING FOLLOWING THE REPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMITTEE WORKING PARTY
ON CAPITAL PROVISION FOR UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES (THE ATKINSON REPORT).
A STRATEGY FOR ARCHIVING GOVERNMENT DATA TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH
COMMUNITY.

THE GOVERNMENT IS THE GREATEST COLLECTOR AND USER OF INFORMATION. STATISTICS
CANADA HAS IDENTIFIED 2,352 MAJOR GOVERNMENT DATA BANKS IN CANADA. IN RESPONSE
TO A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TOO FAR IN ITS DATA
COLLECTION ACTIVITIES, IT IS TRYING TO REDUCE ITS 'PAPERBURDEN'. PERHAPS ONE
SOLUTION IS TO INSTITUTE A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT STRATEGY FOR ARCHIVING
THESE GOVERNMENT DATA, BUT STILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY.
SUGGESTS THAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT MUST ESTABLISH THE INFORMATION OVER
WHICH IT HAS OWNERSHIP AND THE CONDITION OF SUCH OWNERSHIP; NO GOVERNMENT
RECORD MAY BE DESTROYED OR ALTERED WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST
OR HIS DESIGNATE; AND THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECLARE
ANY GOVERNMENT RECORD OR COPY THEREOF AN ARCHIVAL RECORD.
ON THE STABILITY OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BY TRUESWELL.

APPLICATION OF RULES FOR WEEDING THAT ARE BASED UPON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION
OF DEMAND OVER THE COLLECTION REQUIRE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION REMAIN STABLE OVER
TIME. A MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION IS DERIVED THAT TESTS THAT STABILITY.
VERIFICATION OF THE EXPRESSION IS NOT INORDINATELY TIME CONSUMING AND IS VERY
EASY IN THE CASE OF AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS. THE TECHNIQUE WAS FIRST
INTRODUCED BY RICHARD W. TRUESWELL UN 2AMERICAN DOCUMENTATION1 (16) 1965,
20-25.
PROCEEDINGS. CONFERENCE ON THE COLD STORAGE OF MOTION PICTURE FILMS. AMERICAN
FILM INSTITUTE & LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WASHINGTON D.C. APRIL 21-23, 1980.I

AND POTENTIAL USERS OF COLD STORAGE FACILITIES FOR COLOUR MOTION PICTURE
STORAGE. CONTAINS REPORTS DELIVERED AT THE CONFERENCE BY 14 INSTITUTIONS
HAVING SUCH FACILITIES; TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS; DESIGN AND SELECTION OF FILMS
FOR STORAGE; COLOUR RESTORATION OF FADED TRANSPARENCIES; UNDERGROUND STORAGE;
MATTERS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND FOLLOW-UP; GENERAL DISCUSSIONS; UNANSWERED
QUESTIONS; REPORTED STORAGE CONDITIONS; LIST OF MATERIALS DELIVERED AT THE
CONFERENCE; LISTS OF ATTENDEES AND INSTITUTIONS; CINEMATHEQUE QUEBECOISE
REGULATIONS; CONFERENCE PRESS RELEASES; AND RELEVANT NEWSCLIPPINGS.
FROM PROBLEMS PERCEIVED TO PROGRAMS IN PRACTICE' THE PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY
RESOURCES IN THE USA, 1956-1980.

IN THE PAST PRESERVATION WAS LARGELY A NEGLECTED AREA. THIS HISTORICAL REVIEW
FOCUSES ON MAJOR EVENTS, ACTIVITIES, AND PUBLICATIONS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO
THE EMERGENCE OF PRESERVATION AS A VITAL SPECIALITY WITHIN LIBRARIANSHIP.
SIMPLE REPAIR AND PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES FOR COLLECTION CURATORS, LIBRARIANS
AND ARCHIVISTS.

MANUAL OF SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE REPAIR AND PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES, STRESSING
THAT THE CURATOR, LIBRARIAN OR ARCHIVIST SHOULD LEAVE A REPAIR UNDONE RATHER
THAN DO SOMETHING OF WHICH HE/SHE IS UNCERTAIN, AND ALWAYS CARRY OUT
REVERSIBLE REPAIR OR PRESERVATION WORK.
CLEANING AND REPAIRING BOOKS.

AIMED AT THE PERSON WHO IS INTERESTED IN BOOKS AND WANTS HIS LIBRARY TO LOOK
GOOD AND BE IN GOOD REPAIR AND AT BOOK DEALERS WHO WANT TO CLEAN UP THEIR
STOCK. IT IS INTENDED TO HELP THEM DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS IN SIMPLE, EVERYDAY
REPAIRS AND A FEW MORE COMPLICATED ONES.
RESTORATION AT THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE.

2 SPECIALISTS EMPLOYED AT THE FRENCH NATIONAL LIBRARY DESCRIBE HOW RESTORATION
WORK IS ORGANISED, THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEDURES FOR BOOKS
DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE CONSERVATION PRINCIPLES ARE
LISTED, AND TREATMENTS FOR LEAVES, MARGINS AND BINDINGS SPECIFIED WITH
REFERENCE TO THE MATERIALS EMPLOYED. THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS OF TREATING PAPER
MADE FROM WOOD PULP AS OPPOSED TO RAGS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THE
INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE AT THE NEW
WORKSHOPS FROM JUNE 80. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS, AND
PROBLEMS STILL UNSOLVED.
BIOLOGICAL AGENTS THAT ATTACK BOOKS (IN ARABIC).

DISCUSSES THE KINDS OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS SUCH AS SILVERFISH, BOOKWORMS AND
TERMITES WHICH ATTACK BOOKS AND PAPER, WAYS AND METHODS OF FIGHTING AND
KILLING THESE AGENTS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT NEEDED TO PREVENT INSECTS FROM
GROWING, AND THUS TO PROTECT BOOKS FROM DETERIORATION. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH
JORDANIAN LIBRARIES MAY RID THEMSELVES OF THESE PROBLEMS.
SECURITY IN MAP COLLECTIONS.

BRIEFLY SURVEYS THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON GENERAL LIBRARY SECURITY SYSTEMS,
AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY OF SECURITY IN US AND CANADIAN MAP
LIBRARIES. ANALYSES THE INFORMATION OBTAINED ON' THE DEGREE OF MAP LOSS; THE
POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF CIRCULATION POLICIES AND FLOOR PLAN ON MAP LOSS; AND
ALTERNATIVE PROTECTION ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN GENERAL LIBRARY SECURITY SYSTEMS.
CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL IN THE AREA OF MAP SECURITY, AND MAKES
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS TOPIC.
LAZARD BROTHERS' USE OF MICROFILM.

LAZARD BROTHERS IS ONE OF LONDON'S LEADING MERCHANT BANKS, MANAGED IN 3
PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS-BANKING, CORPORATE FINANCE, AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. A
CHANGE OF PREMISES RESULTED IN A LACK OF SPACE FOR THE BANK'S ARCHIVES, AND
THE FIRMS O&M SECTION WAS CALLED UPON TO UNDERTAKE A COMPLETE STUDY OF THE
PROBLEM, WITH 1 REMIT TO CREATE A MICROFILM PROGRAMME. A KODAK 'RELIANT' 450
MICROFILMER WAS USED TO FILM (BY NOW) 5 MILLION DOCUMENTS, AND ANY DOCUMENT
CAN BE FOUND WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF A REQUEST BEING RECEIVED. THE WHOLE
COLLECTION IS HOUSED IN 2 FILING CABINETS. DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE STORAGE
SYSTEM AND ITS COMPLEMENTARY DESTRUCTION OF RECORD REPORT SYSTEM, WHEREBY
REDUNDANT MATERIAL IS WEEDED OUT OF THE COLLECTION.
AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES SERVING THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY
HANDICAPPED' A REFERENCE GUIDE FOR PLANNING.

REFERENCE GUIDE PREPARED BY CUADRA ASSOCIATES FOR THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY
SERVICE FOR THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
PROVIDES A TOOL FOR AUTOMATION PLANNING, DESCRIBING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A
SINGLE SYSTEM AND THE PURCHASE OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS FOR NLS/BPH
NETWORK LIBRARIES.
AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES SERVING THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY
HANDICAPPED' A REFERENCE GUIDE FOR PLANNING.

REFERENCE GUIDE PREPARED UNDER CONTRACT TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE FOR
THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. IT IS THE RESULT OF
A 6-MONTH STUDY TO DEVELOP A PRACTICAL SOURCEBOOK FOR AUTOMATION PLANNING FOR
USE BY LIBRARIES SERVING THE HANDICAPPED.
AUTOMATED CIRCULATION PLANNING FOR A REGION.

IN MAY 79, THE MOUNTAIN VALLEY LIBRARY SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA (MVLS) ENGAGED J.
MATTHEWS AND ASSOCIATES TO PREPARE A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE AUTOMATION OF
CIRCULATION CONTROL ACTIVITIES SYSTEMWIDE. A NUMBER OF CIRCULATION CONTROL
ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED AND 2 OPTIONS WERE EXAMINED IN GREATER DETAIL. A
THOROUGH COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS MADE. AN ACTION PLAN FOR MVLS WAS ALSO
DEVELOPED TO ASSIST THE MEMBER LIBRARIES DURING THE NEXT STEPS OF AUTOMATION.
THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT OF THE STUDY.
BARCODING A COLLECTION-WHY, WHEN, AND HOW.

AS A SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARY, CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES'
APPROACH TO LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS TO AIM FOR AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. IT WAS
DECIDED TO LABEL ALL ITEMS WITH MACHINE-READABLE IDENTIFIERS AND ENTER THE
UNIQUE IDENTIFIER INTO THE DATA BASE AT THE TIME EACH RECORD WAS CREATED. THE
RATIONALE FOR THESE DECISIONS IS DISCUSSED. DIFFERENT TYPES OF
MACHINE-READABLE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE REVIEWED. THE TYPE OF LABELS
CHOSEN AND THE PROCEDURES USED FOR LABELING ITEMS AND FOR ENTERING THE BARCODE
INFORMATION INTO THE MACHINE-READABLE RECORD ARE DISCUSSED.
ORIEL COMPUTER SERVICES-CIRCULATION SYSTEM.

ORIEL'S APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF A CIRCULATION SYSTEM MATCHES ITS APPROACH TO
ITS OTHER LIBRARY AUTOMATION SERVICES. IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A MODULAR
FASHION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR LIBRARY. THE APPROACH IS TO DISCUSS
WITH STAFF THE LIBRARY NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND FROM THESE TO DESIGN A
SYSTEM WHICH MEETS THOSE NEEDS AT MINIMUM COST. A CIRCULATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN
OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN EUROPE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE
GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, SYSTEM ELEMENTS, NETWORK, HARDWARE, SYSTEM
FACILITIES AND OTHER SERVICES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
GEAC IN ACTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HULL.

THE GEAC TERMINALS AT HULL UNIVERSITY ARE STANDARD, COMPRISING KEYBOARD, VDU
AND LIGHTPEN AND THE SYSTEM IS RUN ON A GEAC 8000 MINI. FILES ARE STORED ON
2X300 MEGABYTE DISCS. SINCE HULL HAD NO EXISTING MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE, A
FULL RECORD OF ALL STOCK HAD TO BE COMPILED. THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL
SYSTEM AT PRESENT OPERATES ONLY ON A SMALL SECTION OF THE STOCK, BUT IT IS
HOPED TO EXTEND THIS TO ALL CLASSES. ECONOMIC STRINGENCY OBLIGED HULL TO
DISCARD ITS FLEXIBLE AND EFFECTIVE MANUAL SYSTEM AND REPLACE IT WITH AN
EFFICIENT AND EASILY-USED SYSTEM. GEAC FULFILLED THE UNIVERSITY'S NEEDS, AND
THE PARTIAL SYSTEM OPERATING AT PRESENT MEETS HULL'S REQUIREMENTS.
THE JOY OF CATALOGUING: ESSAYS, LETTERS, REVIEWS, AND OTHER EXPLOSIONS.

FEELINGS THAT CATALOGUING CODES ARE COMPLETELY SENSIBLE AND TRUSTWORTHY AND
ABOVE REPROACH HAVE PRODUCED FEWER, AND GENERALLY LESS CREATIVE AND AUTONOMOUS
CATALOGUERS, POORER CATALOGUE ACCESS TO LIBRARY RESOURCES, GREATER
MYSTIFICATION, MORE FRUSTRATION FOR PATRONS AND STAFF, AND AN ALARMING
PASSIVITY AMONGST CATALOGUERS AND REFERENCE LIBRARIANS ALIKE. PRESENTS PAPERS,
REVIEWS AND ESSAYS, SELECTED FOR THEIR INTELLIGIBILITY, 'FINDABILITY' AND
FAIRNESS, WHICH ATTEMPT TO REDRESS THE BALANCE.
DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH IN INDEXING, CLASSIFICATION, AND CATALOGING.

SPECULATES ON DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL,
WHERE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL IS TAKEN TO INCLUDE INDEXING, CLASSIFICATION,
AND CATALOGUING. THE POSITION TAKEN IS THAT WHILE CONCERNS OF A HOW-TO-DO-IT
NATURE DRIVE THIS FIELD'S RESEARCH, WHICH IS OF AN EVALUATIVE OR DEVELOPMENTAL
NATURE, THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR THIS RESEARCH TO BE BACKED BY BASIC
THEORETICAL RESEARCH.
THE NORDIC CATALOGUING CONFERENCE AT LINKOPING.

REPORT FROM A NORDIC CONFERENCE ON CATALOGUING HELD IN SWEDEN IN APR 81.
IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGES IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOGING POLICY FOR
JUDAICA/HEBRAICA LIBRARIANS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH LIBRARIES 12TH ANNUAL CONVENTION,
WALTHAM, MASS., 28 JUNE 77. DISCUSSES THE CONCEPTS OF CATALOGUING STANDARDS
AND PERMANENT STANDARDS, IN THE LIGHT OF CHANGES IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
CATALOGUING PRACTICE, AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR JEWISH LIBRARIES.
CENTRAL CATALOGUING SERVICE (IN ARABIC).

CENTRAL CATALOGUING MEANS THAT A CENTRAL INSTITUTION TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF CATALOGUING FOR A NUMBER OF BRANCH OR MEMBER LIBRARIES. BRIEFLY TRACES THE
HISTORY OF CENTRALISED CATALOGUING IN THE USA AND UK, AND SUGGESTS THAT
PROVIDED THAT THE PROPOSED NATIONAL LIBRARY IN JORDAN WORKS AS A DEPOSIT
LIBRARY, IT CAN PROMOTE INTERLIBRARY LOAN SERVICES TO ALL OUTLYING LIBRARIES.
THE USE OF THE BLAISE EDITOR AT GARNETT COLLEGE LIBRARY.

GARNETT COLLEGE IS THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S ONLY CUSTOMER TO DEDICATE ITS ENTIRE
CATALOGUING OPERATION TO ON-LINE WORKING AND IS CONSEQUENTLY DEPENDENT ON THE
FACILITIES OFFERED BY THE BLAISE EDITOR. OUTLINES THE CATALOGUING PROCEDURE AT
THE COLLEGE, MENTIONING WEAKNESSES IN EDITOR'S CONCEPTION, THOSE FACILITIES
THAT ARE OF LITTLE PRACTICAL VALUE, ITS ADVANTAGES, AND COST. CONCLUDES THAT
ON-LINE INPUT VIA EDITOR IS AN EFFICIENT AND ECONOMIC MEANS OF PRODUCTION FOR
A COMPUTER-BASED CATALOGUE.
ONLINE PERIODICALS AT HULL COLLEGE OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

DESCRIBES THE OPERATION, WITHIN THE COLLEGE'S MULTI-SITE LIBRARY, OF AN
ON-LINE PERIODICALS CONTROL SYSTEM, DEVELOPED COMPLETELY IN-HOUSE, WHICH
REPLACED AN INEFFICIENT MANUAL SYSTEM. EACH SUBSCRIPTION RECORD HOLDS DETAILS
OF TITLE, ALTERNATIVE TITLE, LOCATION CODE AND SUBJECT CODE AND IS COMPOSED OF
FIXED-LENGTH FIELDS WITH A-CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC CONTROL NUMBER. FIELDS
INCLUDE FREQUENCY, ISSUES PER VOLUME AND PRICE, AND EACH ENTRY MAY BE TERMED
'ALIVE' OR 'INACTIVE'. LIBRARY RECORDS WERE THEN CONVERTED TO MACHINE-READABLE
FORM AND MAY NOW BE SORTED BY LOCATION, TYPE AND SUBJECT/DEPARTMENT. THE
SIMPLE ACCESSIONING PROCEDURES ARE DETAILED. THE SYSTEM WHICH WENT LIVE IN JAN
81 IS PROVING VERY EFFICIENT IN THIS PARTICULAR COLLEGE SITUATION.
THE UTLAS CATSS SYSTEM.

UTLAS (UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS) HAS BEEN SUPPLYING
COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS TO LIBRARIES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND
FRENCH SINCE 1973. IT TAKES A TOTAL APPROACH TO LIBRARY AUTOMATION, OFFERING A
BROAD SPECTRUM OF FULLY INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES. THESE ARE
SUPPLIED BY 3 DISTINCT YET COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS' THE ACQUISITIONS AND SERIALS
CONTROL SYSTEM (ASC), THE CATALOGUE SUPPORT SYSTEM (CATSS), AND THE LIBRARY
COLLECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LCMS). DESCRIBES CATSS, WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF
ALL UTLAS SERVICES.
CATALOGING CONTRIBUTED TO OCLC' A LOOK ONE YEAR LATER.

RESEARCH LIBRARIES FACE DIFFICULT CHOICES IN ESTABLISHING TECHNICAL SERVICES
PROCESSING PRIORITIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE SELECTION OF ITEMS TO RECEIVE
ORIGINAL CATALOGUING. THE AUTHOR DESIGNED A STUDY TO EXAMINE THE DISPOSITION,
1 YEAR AFTER INPUT, OF A SAMPLE OF ORIGINAL CATALOGUING CONTRIBUTED TO THE
OCLC DATA BASE BY THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY, BLOOMINGTON, LIBRARIES. FINDINGS
INDICATE THAT MOST ORIGINAL CATALOGUING CONTRIBUTED BY THIS LIBRARY WAS NOT
SUPERSEDED OR DUPLICATED BY LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOGUING AND THAT MANY
ITEMS WERE NOT CATALOGUED BY ANY OTHER OCLC MEMBER LIBRARY.
AN APPLICATION OF MONITOR DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO AUDIT TRAIL DATA FROM AN
ON-LINE SYSTEM.

SUMMARISING THE METHODS CURRENTLY BEING EMPLOYED AT THE OHIO COLLEGE LIBRARY
CENTER (OCLC) FOR USER INTERACTION ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY PRESENTS SUGGESTIONS
AND PROVIDED EXAMPLES FOR THE USE OF AUDIT TRAIL DATA AVAILABLE FROM MOST
ON-LINE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS. THE SAMPLE DATA USED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE FROM THE
OCLC ON-LINE SYSTEM. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
INDIVIDUALS, INFORMATION, AND STRUCTURE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OCLC' A STUDY
OF INNOVATION DECISION MAKING.

(PHD THESIS-INDIANA UNIVERSITY.) INVESTIGATES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE
1ST COOPERATIVE ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE IN THE WORLD-THE OHIO COLLEGE
LIBRARY CENTER-WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1967, PARTICULARLY THE DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS INVOLVED. FOCUSES ON 3 VARIABLES OF DECISION-MAKING' (1) HOMOGENEITY
OR HETEROGENEITY OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED; (2) THE INFORMATION ON WHICH THE
DECISIONS ARE BASED AND THE INFORMATION-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES INVOLVED; AND
(3) THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF COMMUNICATION AND THE ORGANISATIONAL SETTING.
QUALITY CONTROL AND THE OCLC DATA BASE: A REPORT ON ERROR REPORTING.

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LIBRARIANS WITH A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR REACHING AN INFORMED
POLICY DECISION ON THE QUESTION OF SUBMITTING ERROR REPORTS TO OCLC FOR THE
PURPOSE OF DATA BASE QUALITY CONTROL. IT ADDRESSES 3 QUESTIONS' (1) WHAT TYPES
OF ERRORS, CHANGES, OR ADDITIONS SHOULD BE REPORTED? (2) ONCE REPORTED, WILL
ERRORS BE CORRECTED PROMPTLY? (3) WHAT IS THE COST OF ERROR REPORTING? IT ALSO
REPORTS ON ENHANCE, A NEW APPROACH TO QUALITY CONTROL UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY
OCLC.
QUALITY ISSUES IN RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION PROJECTS.

LATE IN DEC 79 A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 446 MEMBERS OF OCLC, INC., TO
ASCERTAIN THEIR VIEWS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIAL MINIMAL STANDARD TO BE
USED ONLY FOR RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION PROJECTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT 74.5% WOULD
OPPOSE THE CREATION OF A NEW LOWER STANDARD. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTRA
REQUIREMENTS TO UPGRADE AN EARLIER CATALOGUE RECORD TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS,
LIBRARIANS, IN GENERAL, SHOWED A STRONG COMMITMENT TOWARD QUALITY AND
COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT STANDARDS.
PATTERNS IN THE USE OF OCLC BY ACADEMIC LIBRARY CATALOGING DEPARTMENTS.

A SURVEY OF THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENTS OF 166 OCLC-MEMBER ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
SHOWED THAT LIBRARIES DID NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON OCLC FOR CARD PRODUCTION AND
THAT A LARGE MAJORITY DID NOT ACCEPT NON-LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OCLC RECORDS
WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL CHECKING. THE SURVEY INDICATED ALSO THAT LIBRARIES THAT
USED OR PLANNED TO USE THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPES GENERALLY WERE MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPE RECORDS THAN
LIBRARIES THAT DID NOT PLAN TO USE THEIR TAPES.
EXPERIMENTAL ON LINE CATALOG FOR THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE LIBRARIES.

THIS ON-LINE PILOT PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE OCLC
TRANSACTION TAPES TO CREATE AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE, AND THE UTILITY OF THE BRS
DATA BASE STRUCTURE FOR LOADING THIS DATA AND FOR ON-LINE SEARCHING. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE SYSTEM IS THE SOLUTION' AN APPROACH TO INCREASED TECHNICAL SERVICES
PRODUCTIVITY.

IN 1978, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITS
CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
FULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERY
SUCCESSFUL. A 5-POINT PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED' (1) EVALUATE PRESENT OPERATION
AND VARIOUS TASKS; (2) ANALYSE THESE TASKS TO DETECT NON-PRODUCTIVE AREAS OR
AREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4) DOCUMENT THE NEW
PROCEDURES; AND (5) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THE
FACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHER
TASK. WHEN THIS TIME WAS CUT DOWN THROUGH THE USE OF THE MARC DISTRIBUTION
SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE SYSTEM PROVED SUITABLY STREAMLINED TO
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT.
BA CONFERENCE '81.

REPORT OF SOME SESSIONS AT THE 1981 BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE,
INCLUDING THAT ON MACHINE-READABLE CODES (MRCS) (PP 1714-1716) WHICH DEALT
WITH THE REPRESENTATION ON BOOKS OF ISBNS IN BOTH OCR-A AND THE BAR-CODE FORM
OF THE EUROPEAN ARTICLE NUMBERING ASSOCIATION; TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF USING
MRCS; THE CURRENT AND INTENDED USE OF MRCS BY UK PUBLISHERS; BENEFITS OF MRCS;
AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SHOWING PRICES IN MRC FORMAT.
THE NEED FOR A THEORY OF CITING.

CITATIONS GIVE SUBSTANTIVE EXPRESSION TO THE PROCESS OF INNOVATION, BUT UNTIL
NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF THE WAY IN WHICH CITATIONS
REFLECT THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC INFLUENCE. DISCUSSES THE USE OF CITATION AND
CITATION RELATIONSHIP, AND PROPOSES THE INVESTIGATION OF THE SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
OF MAKING REFERENCES OR CITATIONS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE
EFFICIENT AND ECONOMICAL CITATION INDEXES.
COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFORM LIBRARY CATALOG' A SURVEY.

THIS DISCUSSION OF THE USE OF COM AS A FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE LIBRARY
CARD CATALOGUE INCLUDES A BRIEF HISTORY OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES AND OF MICROFORM
TECHNOLOGY SINCE WORLD WAR II. IT IS ARGUED THAT COM CATALOGUEES ARE TO BE
PREFERRED TO CARD CATALOGUES, ON-LINE CATALOGUES ACCESSED BY TERMINALS, AND
PAPER PRINTOUTS. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FILM OR FICHE FORMATS FOR A
LIBRARY CATALOGUE ARE EXPLORED IN RELATION TO RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE, COST, AND
EASE OF USE, AND SUCH FEATURES AS UPDATING PROCEDURES, READABILITY, AND
POSSIBLE PATRON RELUCTANCE TO USE COM ARE DISCUSSED IN GREATER DEPTH. IT IS
CONCLUDED THAT COM APPEARS TO BE THE MOST VIABLE ANSWER TO NEW DEMANDS PLACED
ON THE LIBRARY CATALOGUE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
STARTING AND MANAGING A COM CATALOG.

REPORT OF THE 2-DAY SEMINAR STARTING AND MANAGING A COM CATALOG' CONVERSION
AND PRODUCTION, ORGANISED BY THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY AUTHORITY FOR SYSTEMS AND
SERVICES AND HELD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LIBRARY SCHOOL, LOS
ANGELES, MAY 81. THE 80 DELEGATES REPRESENTED A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARIES,
MOSTLY WITHOUT COM CATALOGUES. TOPICS COVERED BY THE SPEAKERS INCLUDED
MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONVERSION TO COM; CONVERSION OPTIONS; PREPARING
AND LIVING THROUGH CONVERSION; QUALITY CONTROL; FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS;
CONTRACTING; AND EQUIPMENT SELECTION CRITERIA.
FICHE OR FILM FOR COM CATALOGUES-TWO USE TESTS.

THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT
BERKELEY, CARRIED OUT 2 STUDIES IN 1979 IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS UNDERTOOK A
SERIES OF 'CATALOGUE LOOK-UP' QUIZZES, ANSWERING SIMILAR SETS OF QUESTIONS
THROUGH THE USE OF FILM AND FICHE VERSIONS OF THE SAME CATALOGUE. THE 1ST TEST
EMPLOYED AVERAGE LIBRARY USERS-STUDENTS AND THEIR NON-STUDENT ACQUAINTANCES.
THE 2ND TEST FOCUSSED ON CAMPUS LIBRARY STAFF. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE
IS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE EASE OR DIFFICULTY OF USE OF MICROFILM AND
MICROFICHE AND THAT THE DECISION ON WHICH TO INSTALL SHOULD BE BASED ON
GROUNDS OTHER THAN EASE OF USE.
THE EFFECT OF CLOSED CATALOGS ON PUBLIC ACCESS.

FOR AN ABSTRACT OF THIS REPORT SEE 80/1396. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CATALOGUING OF MANUSCRIPTS (IN ARABIC).

DISCUSSION OF THE AACR AND ALA CATALOGUING RULES, WITH EMPHASIS ON MAIN ENTRY
AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION AS RELATED TO MANUSCRIPTS. BRIEFLY COMMENTS ON
THE FILING OF MANUSCRIPTS, BASED ON THE ALA RULES FOR FILING CATALOGUE CARDS.
REVISION OF CATALOGUING RULES AGAIN.

THE WORK BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMITTEE FOR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING MUST
BE SEEN ON THE BACKGROUND OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS IFLA'S WORK
WITH ISBD, AACR2, AND SCANDINAVIAN ATTEMPTS TO REACH COMPATIBILITY WITH
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. THE NEED FOR RULES FOR THE REGISTRATION OF DIFFERENT
MEDIA, WHICH AACR 2 SUPPLIES, IS PRESSING. BUT A DIRECT TRANSLATION OF AACR 2
INTO SWEDISH IS NOT POSSIBLE, AS SOME POINTS NEED DISCUSSION, SUCH AS AACR 2'S
RESTRICTIVE RULES FOR INSTITUTIONS AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AACR 2 AND SOME
ISBD VARIANTS. THE COMMITTEE HOPES TO PRESENT A MANUAL IN JAN 82. THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SHOULD BE ELIMINATION OF DIFFERENCES IN CATALOGUING RULES
FOR RESEARCH AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND MORE RATIONAL USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
MATERIAL, BOTH NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
THE 2CONCISE AACR21.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF 2CONCISE AACR21, CONCENTRATING ON VARIATIONS FROM THE
PROVISIONS OF THE FULL-TEXT AACR 2.
CATALOGING OF AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS' A MANUAL BASED ON AACR2.

MANUAL BASED ON A CATALOGUING WORKSHOP (1979) AND ON CATALOGUING EXPERIENCE,
PRESENTING A SINGLE SET OF RULES FOR THE CATALOGUING OF AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS,
EXCLUDING MUSIC AND CARTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS. RULES FOR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING,
AND CODING AND TAGGING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR INPUT INTO OCLC OR ANY
MARC-BASED SYSTEM ARE GIVEN. THE HISTORY OF CATALOGUING OF AUDIOVISUAL
MATERIAL IS GIVEN IN A CHRONOLOGY BY SUZANNE MASSONEAU.
MICROFORM COPIES AND AACR2' A NOTE.

THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION) DRAWS NO DISTINCTION
BETWEEN MICROFORMS WHICH CONSTITUTE ORIGINAL PUBLICATIONS AND MICROFORMS
ISSUED AS COPIES OF WORKS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED IN HARD COPY. THE US LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS IS REVERTING TO AACR 1 PRACTICE, WHEREBY THE 'BODY OF THE ENTRY'
DESCRIBES THE ORIGINAL HARD COPY VERSION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MICROFORM
VERSION APPEARING AS A NOTE. THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE DISCUSSED.
COLORADO TITLE LOCATOR FILE. TRAINING WORKSHOP DESIGN.

THE 6-HOUR WORKSHOP DESCRIBED IS DESIGNED TO FAMILIARIZE LIBRARIANS WITH A NEW
REFERENCE TOOL, A UNION CATALOGUE ON MICROFICHE OF 40 ACADEMIC, SCHOOL,
PUBLIC, AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN COLORADO, AND TEACH THEM TO USE THIS TOOL IN
A VARIETY OF WAYS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE NULOS PROJECT.

DISCUSSES THE NULOS (NATIONAL UNION LIST OF SERIALS) PROJECT IN PAPUA NEW
GUINEA, 1ST PLANNED IN 1974. IT IS A COMPUTER-PRODUCED LIST OF SERIAL HOLDINGS
OF LIBRARIES WITHIN PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THE PRESENT PROGRAMME, WRITTEN IN COBOL,
ALLOWS ONLY A 93-CHARACTER INPUT. DESCRIBES NULOS 2, DUE FOR COMPLETION IN
LATE 1980, WITH DETAILS OF TITLE REPETITION, TYPE SIZE, VERTICAL LISTING AND
CROSS REFERENCES; AND NULOS 3, THE PROPOSED 3RD EDITION OF THE CATALOGUE,
SCHEDULED FOR 1982.
MISSOURI UNION LIST OF SERIAL PUBLICATIONS.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF THE MISSOURI UNION LIST OF SERIAL
PUBLICATIONS WHICH IS, EFFECTIVELY, MISSOURI'S 1ST STATEWIDE ON-LINE,
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. DESCRIBES THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARC-COMPATIBLE
DATA BASE, AND THE EDITORIAL CONVENTIONS AND PUBLICATION PROCEDURES. OUTLINES
ANTICIPATED PROGRAMME CHANGES AND FUTURE GROWTH POSSIBILITIES.
IMPLIFICATIONS OF HOLOGRAPHY FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

THE ADVANTAGES OF USING HOLOGRAPHY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND OTHER
APPLICATIONS ARE PRESENTED. THE ADVANTAGES ARE HIGHER STORAGE CAPACITY THAN
SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORIES, BUBBLE MEMORIES; UTILISATION FOR CHARACTER
RECOGNITION; 3-DIMENSIONAL PROJECTION; TELEVISION DISCS; COLOUR REPRODUCTION;
ABILITY TO COMBINE WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS OPTICAL FIBRES, VIDEODISC;
REFERENCE; AND FILE SECURITY SYSTEMS.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ORGANISATION OF U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSITORY COLLECTIONS.

THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE PROJECTS A 10% ANNUAL INCREASE IN SALES OVER
FIVE YEARS. RESEARCH ON ACCESSIBILITY TO FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IS SMALL. THIS MAIL
SURVEY, CONDUCTED IN 1979-1980, SOUGHT TO PROVIDE RELIABLE DATA ON STAFF SIZE
AND TYPE, COLLECTION SIZE AND ARRANGEMENT, AND METHODS EMPLOYED TO PROVIDE
DESCRIPTIVE AND SUBJECT ACCESS TO FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IN THE DEPOSITORY SYSTEM.
RESULTS INDICATED THAT ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT 40% OF DEPOSITORY ITEMS WERE BEING
SELECTED YEARLY AND ARRANGED IN SOME FORM OF SEPARATE COLLECTION. 1 IN 4
LIBRARIES DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY DESCRIPTIVE ACCESS; LESS THAN 6% OF THE
LIBRARIES PROVIDE SOME SUBJECT ACCESS. COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY (PARTICULARLY IN
THE FORM OF ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES) IS MODESTLY USED; ONLY 1/3 OF THE
RESPONDENTS INDICATED SUCH SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE. THERE IS NO CLEAR
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCREASED SELECTION OF FEDERAL DOCUMENTS AND INCREASED
USE OF ON-LINE SERVICE S, EXCEPT IN THOSE LIBRARIES CLAIMING TOTALLY SEPARATE
COLLECTIONS.
THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH CONDUCTED DURING A VISITING FELLOWSHIP, MAR
80-MAR 81, ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS' RETRIEVAL METHODS OF DOCUMENTS INDEXED BY
WEIGHTED INDEX TERMS; SIMILARITY MEASURES FOR BOOLEAN SEARCH REQUEST
FORMULATIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS; DOCUMENT-CLUSTERING-BASED INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL AND DOCUMENT CLUSTERING UTILISING PREVIOUSLY FORMED QUERY CLUSTERS;
AND A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN SYSTEMS WITH BOOLEAN
SEARCH REQUEST FORMULATIONS. A NUMBER OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES
APPLICABLE IN SYSTEMS BASED ON BOOLEAN SEARCHES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. SPECIAL
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO INCORPORATE INTO THE STANDARD BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL
SCHEMES A WEIGHTING MECHANISM TO PRODUCE RANKED LISTS OF DOCUMENTS. SEVERAL
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN OFFERED WHICH ARE BASED ON RESULTS OF FUZZY
SET THEORY AND FUZZY LOGIC, PROBABILITY THEORY AND DECISION ANALYSIS, AND THE
THEORY OF BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS.
SLIDE CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGING' FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

A FOLLOW-UP TO AN AUG 78 ARTICLE (SEE ABSTRACT NUMBER 79/1831) ON THE
CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING OF SLIDES USING COLOUR PHOTOCOPYING. PRESENTS
UNSOLICITED REACTIONS TO THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE BY VARIOUS LIBRARIANS, AS WELL
AS OTHERS, WHO BECAME AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF SLIDE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FROM
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SLIDE SYSTEM DEVELOPED FOR USE IN THE C-E REFRACTIONS,
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LIBRARY.
INTERNATIONAL PATENT CLASSIFICATION FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF JAPANESE USERS.

TO CLARIFY THE RULES OF IPC (INTERNATIONAL PATENT CLASSIFICATION), THE
JAPANESE PATENT OFFICE HAS ISSUED A WORKING STANDARD FOR ASSIGNING IPCS, THE
CONTENTS OF WHICH ARE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. IN SOME SELECTED GROUPS, THE JAPANESE
PATENT OFFICE USES AN IPC SUBDIVISION CALLED 'DEVELOPING MARKS'; IN OTHERS, A
SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION IS USED, CALLED 'FACET CLASSIFICATION MARKS'. MENTIONS
SOME JAPANESE PROPOSALS FOR THE 4TH EDITION OF IPC, PREPARATION OF WHICH IS
UNDER WAY.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AS AN AID TO THE REVISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT
CLASSIFICATION (IPC).

REPORTS RECENT WORK BY THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY ORGANIZATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER STATISTICAL DATA CONCERNING THE
APPLICATION OF SYMBOLS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT CLASSIFICATION (IPC) TO
PATENT DOCUMENTS CAN BE USED AS AN AID TO IDENTIFYING AREAS OF THE IPC IN NEED
OF REVISION. GIVES THE RESULTS OF 2 STUDIES WHICH HIGHLIGHT SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF IPC BOTH AT THE SECTION (OR HIGH) LEVEL AS
WELL AS AT THE SUBGROUP (OR LOW) LEVEL.
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADING PATTERNS IN OCLC MONOGRAPHIC RECORDS.

EXAMINES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBJECT HEADINGS OCCURRING IN CATALOGUING
RECORDS. ANALYSES A SAMPLE OF 33,455 MONOGRAPHIC RECORDS FROM THE OCLC DATA
BASE. THE SAMPLE CONTAINED A TOTAL OF 50,213 SUBJECT HEADINGS, 94% OF WHICH
WERE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADINGS. EACH RECORD HAD AN AVERAGE OF 1.4
LC HEADINGS, BUT 18.6% HAD NO LC HEADINGS. TOPICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS ACCOUNTED
FOR 70% OF ALL LCSH, AND 62% OF ALL RECORDS CONTAINED AT LEAST ONE LC TOPICAL
SUBJECT HEADING. EACH HAD AN AVERAGE OF 0.78 SUBDIVISIONS. FORM SUBDIVISIONS
WERE THE MOST COMMON TYPE FOUND, FOLLOWED BY PLACE AND TOPICAL SUBDIVISIONS.
PERIOD SUBDIVISIONS WERE USED RELATIVELY INFREQUENTLY.
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF COMPOUND WORDS IN THESAURI, WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO BS 5723' 1979.

ALTHOUGH MANY LARGE SYSTEMS HAVE BY-PASSED THE PROBLEM BY USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE, COMPOUND WORDS REMAIN A DIFFICULTY IN THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION. FORMER
ATTEMTS TO DEVISE RULES WHICH ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM VIA SYNTAX WERE
NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY. PROPOSES THAT THE MAJOR CRITERIA FOR HANDLING
COMPOUND WORDS SHOULD REST UPON THEIR ORTHOGRAPHY, LEXICOGRAPHY AND SEMANTICS,
WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE POSSIBLE OCCURRENCE OF HOMOGRAPHS (WORDS OF A
COMMON FORM BUT DIFFERENT MEANINGS). SUGGESTIONS CONTAINED IN BRITISH STANDARD
5723-2GUIDELINES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF MONOLINGUAL
THESAURI1-ARE ASSESSED IN RELATION TO THESE CRITERIA. THE STANDARD IS
CRITICISED FOR ITS INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION TO MECHANISED SYSTEMS' REQUIREMENTS
AND PARTIAL FAILURE IN NOT RECORDING THE DIVERGENT NEEDS OF PRE- AND
POST-COORDINATE SYSTEMS.

METHOD FOR GENERATING A CHEMICAL REACTION INDEX FOR STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF
INFORMATION.

A NEW METHOD FOR INDEXING CHEMICAL REACTIONS IS DESCRIBED. THE CALCULATION OF
A REACTION CONNECTIVITY INDEX RESULTS IN A UNIQUE NUMBER. THIS NUMBER DOES NOT
PROVIDE HIERARCHICAL OR RELATIONAL INFORMATION. IT ENCODES THE CONCEPT OF THE
REACTION PROCESS IN A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER WHICH IS SUGGESTED FOR USE, MUCH AS
THE CAS REGISTRY NUMBER IS USED, TO OPTIMISE EASE OF STORAGE, MANIPULATION,
AND RETRIEVAL FROM LARGE COMPUTER FILES.
ANALYSIS AND CODING OF GENERIC CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS.

PRESENTS A FORMAL LINGUISTIC APPROACH TO THE REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC
CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF USE OF THE ALWIN
LINE-FORMULA NOTATION (AN ALGORITHMIC VERSION OF THE WISWESSER LINE NOTATION).
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REPRESENTATION IS TO PERMIT SEARCHES FOR SPECIFIC
STRUCTURES AND FOR SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE GENERIC
EXPRESSION. THE RELEVANCE OF PATTERN ANALYSIS METHODS TO THIS PROBLEM IS
HIGHLIGHTED AND PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS ON ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT ARE PUT
FORWARD.

PROBLEMS OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY FOR THE EURONET USER.

A FRANKLIN INSTITUTE GMBH, MUNICH, TECHNICAL REPORT PREPARED FOR THE
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. ITS PURPOSE WAS TO THROW
LIGHT ON THE REQUIREMENTS, PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS CONCERNING DOCUMENT
ORDERING AND DELIVERY THROUGH EURONET/DIANE. MANY CLASSES OF INDIVIDUAL AND
ORGANISATION WERE INTERVIEWED, REVEALING A LEVEL OF DEMAND OF 6 MILLION
DOCUMENTS ANNUALLY WHICH IS INCREASING AT A RATE OF 4-10% PER YEAR. EURONET
ON-LINE SEARCHING COULD HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THESE FIGURES, ACCOUNTING
FOR 50% OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND. PRESENT DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES APPEAR TO
BE OPERATING AT CAPACITY AND AS AUTOMATED ORDERING SERVICE COULD BE HIGHLY
BENEFICIAL.
THE USE OF ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF COMPLEX LITIGATION.

DESCRIBES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPUTERIZED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
WHICH COULD BE USED BY ATTORNEYS ENGAGED IN SUCH COMPLEX LITIGATION AS (1)
CASES WHICH INVOLVE MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION; (2) CASES INVOLVING COMPLEX
ISSUES OF FACT, AS IN REGULATORY AGENCY ACTIONS; (3) CASES INVOLVING A LARGE
NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS; AND (4) CASES WITH A SHORT PREPARATION TIME. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

AUCKLAND PUBLIC'S ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE.

IN JUNE 80, A NEW ZEALAND POST OFFICE OASIS TERMINAL (OVERSEAS ACCESS SERVICE
TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS) STARTED OPERATING IN THE COMMERCE, SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF AUCKLAND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ITS ADVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY ARTICLES IN LOCAL PAPERS, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, AND BASIC ON-LINE TRAINING
OF LIBRARY STAFF. DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING THE 1ST 10 MONTHS OF
THE SERVICE AND DISCUSSES CHANGING PHILOSOPHIES WORLDWIDE. CONCLUDES THAT
ON-LINE SEARCHING IS COMING TO BE REGARDED AS AN EXTENSION OF TRADITIONAL
REFERENCE SERVICES; IT WILL NEVER BE SELF-FINANCING AND MUST BE PLANNED,
BUDGETED FOR, INTRODUCED AND DIRECTED LIKE ANY OTHER ASPECT OF LIBRARY WORK;
ITS SPEED HIGHLIGHTS THE PRESENT SLOWNESS OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY; AND IT IS A
NEW CHALLENGE TO THE LIBRARIAN'S PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND JUDGEMENT.
COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION RESOURCES IN CANADA.

THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEW, NON-PRINTING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH DISSEMINATE
INFORMATION ARE EXPLAINED. DESCRIPTIONS ARE GIVEN OF A MAGNETOGRAPHIC PRINTER
DESIGNED BY DUPONT, TELETEX, TELETEXT, VIEWDATA AND TELETEL, A FRENCH VIEWDATA
SYSTEM WHICH MAY WELL BE USED TO PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE DIRECTORY.
WIDE-BAND CABLE NETWORKS AND LASER-BASED INFORMATION STORAGE SYSTEMS ARE ALSO
DISCUSSED. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PRINTING INDUSTRY OF THESE NEW
TECHNOLOGIES ARE EXAMINED.
VIEWDATA/VIDEOTEXT MARKET IN EUROPE (PROSPECTUS ONLY).

AN ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL OF 2-WAY COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS BASED ON THE
TELEPHONE AND TELEVISION UP TO 1989 IS PRESENTED. THE REPORT CONSIDERS THE USE
OF VIEWDATA, OR VIDEOTEX, SYSTEMS IN THE UK, FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY. HOME,
BUSINESS AND PUBLIC USE OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED AND COMPARED. WHILE THE
MAJORITY OF THE REPORT IS DEVOTED TO EUROPE, A SECTION DEALS WITH THE US,
JAPAN AND CANADA.
VIDEOTEX DOSSIER' US WIRED AND BROADCAST SERVICES.

THIS SURVEY OF WORLD VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS INCLUDES DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MAIN
EXPERIMENTS AND PROJECTS, AND INFORMATION ON PARTICULAR COMPANIES' INTERESTS.
ANTIOPE, PRESTEL AND TELIDON ARE DISCUSSED. LEGAL PROBLEMS WITH VIDEOTEX IN
THE USA ARE DISCUSSED AND EXPERIMENTS WITH BROADCAST SYSTEMS AROUND THE USA
ARE DESCRIBED. NONBROADCAST SYSTEMS, ELECTRONIC NEWSPAPER PROJECTS,
TELESHOPPING, CAPTIONING AND OTHER TELETEXT SCHEMES ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.
MEDIA PROJECT: TELETEXT AND PRESTEL. NEW INFORMATION SERVICES FOR VOLUNTARY
ORGANISATIONS?.

THE WAY IN WHICH SOCIAL AGENCIES AND VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS COULD MAKE USE OF
TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR WORK TO SEEK
VOLUNTEERS, TO RAISE MONEY AND TO PROVIDE AN INFORMATION SERVICE IN THEIR AREA
OF WORK IS DISCUSSED.
TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA' A NEW CHALLENGE FOR THE DESIGNER.

TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA DISPLAYS PRESENT A STRONG CHALLENGE TO THE INFORMATION
DESIGNER. THE MONOSPACED DOT MATRIX CHARACTERS ARE RELATIVELY CRUDE IN THEIR
DESIGN, AND THEIR POSITIONING IS DETERMINED BY A FIXED GRID. THE GRAPHICS
FACILITY IS ALSO SOMEWHAT CRUDE. THE SCOPE FOR TYPOGRAPHIC AND SPATIAL CODING
OF INFORMATION IS THEREFORE VERY LIMITED. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY
OF USING COLOUR AS A WAY OF CODING INFORMATION. 7 COLOURS, INCLUDING WHITE,
ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEY ARE NOT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AND THIS HAS IMPORTANT
IMPLICATIONS FOR LEGIBILITY. BEARING IN MIND THE CONSTRAINTS AND FREEDOM
OFFERED BY THIS KIND OF DISPLAY, WAYS OF PRESENTING TEXT, TABLES, INDEXES AND
GRAPHICS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE DISCUSSED.
VIEWDATA AND THE INFORMATION AGE-PART 2' THEORY INTO PRACTICE.

VIEWDATA APPLICATIONS ARE SAID TO BE DIVIDED INTO 4 MAIN AREAS' RESIDENTIAL,
PUBLIC, BUSINESS, AND SPECIALISED. PREDICTS THAT, WITHIN 3 YEARS, THE RATIO OF
DOMESTIC TO BUSINESS USERS WILL BE AROUND 5 TO 1. VARIOUS APPLICATIONS ARE
DESCRIBED (E.G. VIEWDATA ADAPTED TO HELP THE DEAF COMMUNICATE VIA TELEPHONE).
PARTICULAR REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE USE OF MICROCOMPUTERS AS VIDEOTEX
RECEIVERS (OR VICE VERSA) TO FORM THE BASIS OF TELESOFTWARE. A BRIGHT FUTURE
IS PREDICTED FOR VIEWDATA AND TELETEXT WITH PLENTY OF POTENTIAL FOR DIVERSE
APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COUPLED WITH HOME MICROCOMPUTERS.
BUSINESS VIEWDATA EYES THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.

THE PROSPECTS FOR USING A VIEWDATA SYSTEM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE OFFICE ARE
CONSIDERED. THE SHIFT OF EMPHASIS FROM THE HOME TO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS IS
SHOWN, AND THIS IS EXTENDED TO PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS. 5 LEVELS OF
SOPHISTICATION ARE ENVISAGED, FROM INDIVIDUAL USERS TO INTERNATIONAL SERVICES.
BUSINESS ORGANISATION AND EQUIPMENT WHICH MAY BE SEEN IN THE FUTURE ARE
DISCUSSED.
A VIEWDATA INTERFACE FOR ARBITRARY COMPUTER PROGRAMS.

DESCRIBES THE MAIN ALGORITHMS IN A COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR INTERFACING A VIEWDATA
TERMINAL WITH ARBITRARY APPLICATION COMPUTER PROGRAMS (WHICH WERE NOT
SPECIALLY WRITTEN FOR THE TERMINAL). THE INTERFACE HANDLES THE PROBLEMS OF
PARTIONING THE INPUT AND OUTPUT TO OR FROM THE APPLICATION TO SUIT THE SMALL
AND NON-SCROLLING SCREEN OF THE VIEWDATA TERMINAL.
TALKING TO THE TELEVISION.

BRIGHTON POLYTECHNIC (IN COLLABORATION WITH ITV AND BBC) IS CONDUCTING A
PROJECT TO STUDY THE EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF TELETEXT. 10 SUITABLE
TELEVISION SETS WILL BE PLACED IN SCHOOLS, TEACHING MATERIALS WILL BE PRODUCED
FOR THEM AND THEIR USE WILL BE MONITORED. THE BBC'S CEEFAX, ITV'S ORACLE AND
THE GPO'S PRESTEL FORM THE BASIS FOR THE EXPERIMENT, BUT IT IS FELT THAT THESE
HAVE SHOWN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE IN THE PAST. A NEW
DEVELOPMENT, TELESOFTWARE, COULD OVERCOME SUCH LIMITATIONS. TELESOFTWARE
ALLOWS THE USER TO 'TALK' TO THE TELEVISION SET, PAGES OF INFORMATION BECOME
INSTANTLY AVAILABLE, SOME PAGES CAN CARRY INSTRUCTIONS, AND SPECIFIC
PROGRAMMES FOR MICROCOMPUTER USE MAY BE RECEIVED.
DATA QUALITY IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

UNTIL RECENTLY, DATA QUALITY WAS POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND SELDOM ACHIEVED, YET IT
IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EFFECTIVE USE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS. DISCUSSES THE NATURE
AND IMPORTANCE OF DATA QUALITY. THE ROLE OF DATA QUALITY IS PLACED IN THE LIFE
CYCLE FRAMEWORK. MANY NEW CONCEPTS, TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FROM BOTH PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGES AND DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE PRESENTED AND RELATED TO DATA
QUALITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE CONCEPT OF A DATA BASE CONSTRAINT IS CONSIDERED IN
DETAIL. SOME CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE PROPOSED.
DOMESTIC' A MINICOMPUTER BASED INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.

DOMESTIC (DEVELOPMENT OF MINICOMPUTERS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION CENTERS) IS A JOINT ISRAELI-WEST GERMAN PROJECT FOR
THE APPLICATION OF MINICOMPUTERS IN INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL. THE
DOMESTIC SOFTWARE PACKAGE INCLUDES FUNCTIONS FOR ON-LINE CREATION AND UDATING
OF INHOUSE DATA BASES; ASSIMILATION OF EXTERNAL DATA BASES; SETTING UP,
RUNNING AND REFORMULATING ON-LINE SEARCHES; VIEWING SEARCH RESULTS; PRINTING
THE OUTPUT IN SELECTED FORMATS; AND ACQUISITIONS, CATALOGUING AND CIRCULATION
TASKS. BY JUNE 80, THE DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
FUNCTIONS HAD BEEN PROGRAMMED AND DEVELOPMENT WAS UNDER WAY ON THE FUNCTIONS
FOR ON-LINE INPUT, DATA BASE MAINTENANCE, PRINT GENERATOR, AND LIBRARY
MANAGEMENT.
SELECTING A TERMINAL FOR ONLINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

DISCUSSES THE CRITERIA A USER MUST CONSIDER WHEN SELECTING A TERMINAL TO
ACCESS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ON-LINE DATA BASES. DIVIDED INTO 3 SECTIONS'
WHAT TERMINAL SHALL I CHOOSE?; MODEMS AND ACOUSTIC COUPLERS; AND TABLE OF
TERMINALS AND SLAVE PRINTERS SUITABLE FOR ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
EVALUATION OF THE ONLINE SEARCH PROCESS.

THE STUDY EVALUATED ON-LINE SEARCHING PERFORMED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
MEDICINE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IMPLICATIONS FOR TRAINING AND CONTINUING
EDUCATION. SEARCHERS WERE SELECTED WITH FORMAL AND INFORMAL TRAINING, FROM 3
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANISATION, AND WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE. IT
WAS FOUND THAT MOST SEARCHERS HAVE MASTERED THE BASICS OF SEARCHING, AND THAT
PERFORMANCE WAS UNAFFECTED BY SOURCE OF TRAINING, EXPERIENCE, ORGANISATIONAL,
OR EVEN SUBJECT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. THE MOST CONSISTENT SOURCE OF
DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SEARCH ITSELF. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
POLIS' PARLIAMENTARY ONLINE INFORMATION SYSTEM.

MPS AT THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVE URGENT INFORMATION NEEDS. THE HOUSE
OF COMMONS LIBRARY PRODUCES 9 STRIP INDEXES OF INFORMATION, BUT THESE HAVE
DISADVANTAGES, IN THAT ENTRIES USUALLY APPEAR UNDER 1 HEADING, ONLY SELECTED
PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN INDEXED, AND THE LIBRARY'S 3 LOCATIONS MAKE
ACCESS DIFFICULT. IN 1979 A NEW DATA BASE WAS BEGUN, AND IT WILL FORM A SINGLE
INDEX TO ALL MATERIAL PREVIOUSLY HELD ON STRIP INDEXES, AND OTHER INFORMATION
SUCH AS PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS. DESCRIBES THE INPUT FLOW FOR THE NEW ON-LINE
DATA BASE-POLIS, AND DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ARE GIVEN.

FOR AN ABSTRACT OF THIS PAPER SEE 81/1693.
PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES
AND THE FORMAT OF THE NEW PATENT INDEX, DERIVED FROM THE INPADOC DATA AND
INTRODUCED IN JAN 81.
MAGNETIC TAPE SERVICE OF VINITI.

REVIEWS BRIEFLY SOME OF THE DATA BASES AVAILABLE IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE USA
(INSPEC, BIOSIS, METADEX, CAS ETC). DISCUSSES THE WORK OF THE MAJOR PRODUCERS
OF USSR DATA BASES, AMONGST WHICH ARE' THE ALL-UNION INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION WHICH PREPARES MACHINE READABLE VERSIONS OF ITS
INFORMATION PUBLICATIONS; THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF PATENT
INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICAL STUDIES WHICH PROCESSES PATENT
INFORMATION FROM COMECON COUNTRIES WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE INPADOC DATABASE;
AND THE ALL-UNION SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRE WHICH PRODUCES
DATA BASES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THESES AND SCIENTIFIC REPORTS.
SUBSYSTEM 'FRAGMENT' WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INTEGRAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.

A STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHETHER FRAGMENTS, WHICH HAVE AN
INDEPENDENT MEANING AS FAR AS THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF SPECIALISTS ARE
CONCERNED, CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. IT IS SHOWN THAT IT IS
POSSIBLE TO CREATE A FILE CALLED 'FRAGMENT' AND TO USE THIS FILE, TOGETHER
WITH DOCUMENTARY AND DATA FILES, TO PRODUCE AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
THE 'FRAGMENT' FILE REPRESENTS A NEW TYPE OF INFORMATION SERVICE' IN RESPONSE
TO ASPECT ENQUIRIES, A NUMBER OF RELEVANT FRAGMENTS CAN BE LOCATED WITHOUT
USING PRIMARY SOURCES. THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE SELECTION AND INDEXING
OF THE FRAGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED.
TEXT PASSAGE RETRIEVAL BASED ON COLON CLASSIFICATION' RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE.

A SET OF EXPERIMENTS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE COLON
CLASSIFICATION AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS, REPRESENTATION AND
RETRIEVAL OF PRIMARY INFORMATION FROM THE FULL TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. FULL TEXT
DATA BASES WERE CREATED IN 2 SUBJECT AREAS AND QUERIES SOLICITED FROM
SPECIALISTS IN EACH AREA. AN AUTOMATED FULL TEXT INDEXING SYSTEM, ALONG WITH 4
AUTOMATED PASSAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, WAS CREATED TO TEST THE VARIOUS FEATURES
OF THE COLON CLASSIFICATION. 2 BOOLEAN-BASED SYSTEMS AND 1 SIMPLE WORD
OCCURRENCE SYSTEM WERE CREATED IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE RETRIEVAL RESULTS
AGAINST TYPES OF SYSTEMS WHICH ARE IN MORE COMMON USE. THE SYSTEMS' RETRIEVAL
PERFORMANCES WERE MEASURED USING RECALL AND PRECISION AND THE MEAN EXPECTED
SEARCH LENGTH REDUCTION FACTORS. OVERALL, COLON-BASED SYSTEMS DID NOT PERFORM
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE OTHER SYSTEMS.
LIBRARY STOCK AS A SYSTEM OF PARTIAL BOOKSTOCKS.

IN A PARTICULAR LIBRARY THE BOOKSTOCK IS A HETEROGENOUS ENTITY WHICH CONSISTS
OF MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND LANGUAGES, WITH DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL
AND REGIONAL CONNOTATIONS WHICH SERVE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF READERS. THUS, THE
AVAILABLE BOOKSTOCK NATURALLY SUBDIVIDES INTO A NUMBER OF ENTITIES WHICH
BELONG TO THE SAME CATEGORY AND THE SUBJECT MATTER APPEARS TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT CRITERION. LARGE LIBRARIES IN SLOVAKIA E.G. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE SPECIFIC READING ROOMS FOR PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK E.G. NATURAL SCIENCES OR
LIBRARIANSHIP. SPECIAL PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL PUBLICATIONS
SUCH AS THESES, RESEARCH REPORTS, INTERNAL TRANSLATIONS AND OTHERS. IN DEALING
WITH PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THE TYPE OF READER USING
IT (E.G. CHILDREN), THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE STOCK (TRADITIONAL OR MICRO),
GEOGRAPHICAL RELEVANCE AND THE FREQUENCY OF ITS USAGE. THE DIFFERENTIAL ASPECT
OF BOOKSTOCK IS WELL WORTH BEARING I N MIND FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF
UTILISING LIBRARY RESOURCES.

ARGUES THAT THE CLASSIFICATION OF JOURNALS IS NOT ALWAYS DESIRABLE. GIVES
REASONS FOR FILING SCIENCE JOURNALS BY TITLE, AND MAKES SOME SUGGESTIONS
CONCERNING THE ARRANGEMENT OF SCIENCE COLLECTIONS.
THE READING DIMENSION IN EFFECTIVENESS AND SERVICE.

ANALYSES OF FICTION HAVE INDICATED THAT FICTION PLAYS A MORE SIGNIFICANT AND
VALUABLE ROLE IN SOCIETY THAN APPRECIATED AND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LITERATURE
FORM AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY LEVEL. THE HABIT OF ARRANGING FICTION IN
ALPHABETICAL ORDER BY AUTHOR PRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF READERS WITH A DAUNTING
PROBLEM OF CHOICE. CATEGORISATION BY SUBJECT MATTER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SATISFY
THE PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN AND UNEXPRESSED DESIRES OF READERS FOR PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN
TYPES OF FICTION. THIS INCREASES THE LIBRARY'S EFFECTIVENESS. WITH AN EMPHASIS
ON THE READER, DISCUSSES OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCING LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.
INFORMATION OVERLOAD' WHAT THE CONGRESS AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

THE APPLICABILITY OF AUDIOVISUAL AIDS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND TRAINING IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

READING ABILITY IS THE RESULT OF A PROLONGED FORMAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS
REQUIRING PRACTICE, EXPERIENCE AND ACCESS TO PRINT MATERIALS. IT APPEARS
OBVIOUS THAT AUDIOVISUALS WOULD GREATLY AID COMMUNICATION, PARTICULARLY IN
COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF PRINT ILLITERACY OR SEMI-LITERACY,
AND THERE IS A WIDELY HELD ASSUMPTION THAT PICTURES ARE A FORM OF
TRANSCULTURAL LANGUAGE WHICH EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS AND CAN INTERPRET. DISCUSSES
PICTORIAL LITERACY, APPLICABILITY OF AUDIOVISUALS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
FORMS OF VISUALS AND THE VALUE OF THEIR CORRECT DESIGN, VALUES OF AUDIOVISUALS
PRODUCED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, STANDARDS OF PRODUCTION AND CHOICE OF
FORMAT, AND APPROPRIATE AUDIOVISUAL FORMATS.

DISCUSSES THE ORGANISATION OF A SYSTEM OF TERRITORIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES UNDER
FORMATION IN POLAND, BASED ON THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE 3RD ALL-COUNTRY MEETING
OF BIBLIOGRAPHERS, 1978. THE NEW SYSTEM IS BASED ON A PLANNED, CONTROLLED
SYSTEM OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES COVERING THE WHOLE TERRITORY OF THE COUNTRY, AND
SYNCHRONISED WITH THE COUNTRY'S PRESENT ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION. IT IS
DESIGNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, BY RECORDING
INFORMATION SOURCES NOT AT PRESENT COVERED BY IT. TERRITORIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES

PERIODICALS FOR THE DISABLED' THEIR IMPORTANCE AS INFORMATION SOURCES.

RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION MANDATES INTEGRATION OF DISABLED AMERICANS INTO THE
MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
PHYSICALLY DISABLED. LIBRARIANS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS MUST GAIN AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSPECTIVES AND CONCERNS OF DISABLED PEOPLE, AND THIS IS
BEST GAINED FROM PERSONAL CONTACT. WHERE THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, READING OF THE
PERIODICAL LITERATURE PUBLISHED FOR AND BY THE DISABLED IS RECOMMENDED. THESE
PERIODICALS HAVE CHANGED AS THE INFORMATION DEMANDS OF THE DISABLED HAVE
EVOLVED, AND THEY OFFER INFORMATION NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE. THEY CAN EDUCATE
LIBRARIANS, REHABILITATION WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEEDS AND
ABILITIES OF THE DISABLED IN THE USA.

HAS THE 'IN-HOUSE' SYNDROME GONE TOO FAR?.

THE 1959 NATIONAL PRINTING STRIKE FORCED MANY COMPANIES AND ORGANISATIONS TO
INSTALL IN-HOUSE PRINTING UNITS, AND MANY LATER ADDED MICROFORM UNITS. THE LOW
AVERAGE QUALITY OF MICROFORM PRODUCED AND THE POOR ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SUCH
UNITS, SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS IN THESE TIMES OF RECESSION AND INCREASING
COMPETITION IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MANY LARGE ORGANISATIONS TO CUT BACK
ON SUCH LUXURIES AND START TO SUPPORT SMALL LOCAL SERVICE BUSINESSMEN MORE.

PAPER PRESENTED AND THE MICROGRAPHICS IN BANKING AND INSURANCE SEMINAR,
BRISTOL, MAR 80. PRESENTS AN OUTLINE OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF THE
GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE ASSURANCE COMPANY, A COMPOSITE INSURANCE COMPANY
DEALING IN ALL CLASSES OF INSURANCE. FOR LEGAL REASONS PAPER RECORDS ARE
IMPORTANT, SINCE, ALTHOUGH MICROFILM IS ACCEPTED BY COURTS, THE EVIDENCE ON IT
MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED. USE OF MICROFILM TO SAVE SPACE IN KEEPING RECORDS HAS TO
BE SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE. A PILOT SCHEME WAS LAUNCHED AT 5 BRANCHES, USING
16 OF THE LARGEST AND MOST SUITABLE TABULATIONS FOR MICROFILM. A REPORT ON
PROBLEMS IN THE USE OF MICROFILM WAS PRODUCED, HIGHLIGHTING RESISTANCE TO
CHANGE, AND CRITICISMS OF THE MICROREADER. A MODIFIED FRONT PROJECTION READER
WAS OBTAINED AND WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH ACCLAIM. THE CONVERSION OF COMPUTER
TABULATED OUTPUT TO COM IS REACHING ITS CONCLUSION, AND THE COMPANY IS NOW

EFFECTS OF STANDARDISATION AT SHOP FLOOR LEVEL. A LIST OF SUB-COMMITTEES AND
THEIR CHAIRMEN IS PROVIDED.
NMA, APRIL 1980, NEW YORK: A PERSONAL VIEW.

PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THE NATIONAL MICROGRAPHICS ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE AND
EXPOSITION, NEW YORK, APR 80. THE CONFERENCE THEME WAS 'FOCUS ON
PRODUCTIVITY', ALTHOUGH IT WAS FELT THAT SOME SESSIONS HAD LITTLE RELEVANCE TO
THE THEME. SPECIAL INTEREST SUBJECTS WERE ALSO COVERED-COMPUTER-RELATED
SESSIONS, BANKING/FINANCE SESSIONS AND INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY SESSIONS.
DELEGATES WERE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY THAN ARE THEIR
UK COUNTERPARTS. THE EXPOSITION ATTRACTED ABOUT 150 EXHIBITORS. THE PRIME
INTEREST WAS IN COM, AND THE EXHIBITION WAS LESS GIMMICKY THAN EXPECTED.

OF THE 80S. OTHER SUBJECTS COVERED BY CIVIL SERVANTS IN LOCAL AUTHORITIES
WERE' CONDITIONS FOR AND CLAIMS ON THE SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT IN THE 80S;
COOPERATION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CIVIL SERVANTS AND POLITICIANS, AND
CIVIL SERVANTS' RIGHT OF FREE EXPRESSION. A SURVEY OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN
DENMARK SINCE 1909 WAS GIVEN BY LIBRARIANS. R. LYSHOLT HANSEN WAS RESIGNED TO
THE FACT THAT THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES DID NOT WISH TO ENTER INTO A JOINT
DIRECTORATE, BUT ARGUED THAT SOME WAY OF SECURING FAIR RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION
SHOULD BE FOUND. THE FINAL SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION WAS' PROVISION AND MANAGEMENT
IN THE LIBRARIES OF TOMORROW, WHEN THE  RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN CENTRALISATION,
NECESSARY IN A TIME OF CUTS, AND INDIVIDUALITY WAS DEBATED.
OUR TASKS.
     
THE OFFICIAL 1977-UNESCO STATISTICS SHOW THAT, AS FAR AS NUMBERS OF LIBRARIES
AND LIBRARIANS, AND ALSO ANNUAL ACQUISITIONS PER HEAD OF POPULATION, ARE
CONCERNED, BULGARIA LIES IN THE 7TH AND 4TH PLACES RESPECTIVELY IN THE WORLD.
HOWEVER, BULGARIA TAKES THE 14TH AND 19TH PLACES IN LOANS AND IN TURNOVER OF
CURRENT BOOK COLLECTIONS. THUS, HIGHER EFFICIENCY REQUIRED IN ALL FIELDS OF
THE NATION'S LIFE BY THE RECENT 12TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY
MUST ALSO BE AIMED FOR IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. GREAT ATTENTION
MUST BE PAID IN PARTICULAR TO SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES WHICH
NEED TO COPE NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESENT INFORMATION EXPLOSION, BUT ALSO WITH
SOARING PRICES OF WESTERN PUBLICATIONS AND BULGARIA'S LIMITED FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF
LIBRARIANS, THE NEEDS IN NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS, MECHANISATION, AUTOMATION, AND
UPDATING OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, NOT
ONLY AS KEEPER OF THE NATIONAL LITERARY HERITAGE, BUT ALSO AS THE MOST
IMPORTANT LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY, IS, IN ITSELF,
A SPECIAL CASE. IT SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF SOME OF ITS PROBLEMS ON THE OCCASION
OF THE 1300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BULGARIAN STATE.

EFFICIENCY, TAYLORISM, AND LIBRARIES IN PROGRESSIVE AMERICA.
     
THE SAME INTENSE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT SURROUNDED THE WORD 'ENERGY' IN THE
LATE 1970S WAS FELT IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORD 'EFFICIENCY' IN THE LATE 19TH
AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES. EFFICIENCY WAS FELT TO BE THE KEY TO PUTTING INTO
ORDER THE CHAOS RESULTING FROM THE TECHNOLOGICAL/INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. THE
PUBLICATION OF FREDERICK W. TAYLOR'S 2PRINCIPLES OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT1 IN
1911 IS OFTEN ERRONEOUSLY CITED AS THE BEGINNING OF THE EFFICIENCY CRAZE.
DISCUSSES THE PRINCIPLES PROPOUNDED BY TAYLOR, THE EFFICIENCY CRAZE, AND ITS
EFFECTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES.

TAKE PLACE IN LEIPZIG. THE MAIN THEME OF THE CONFERENCE WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY
EAST GERMANY WILL BE 'LIBRARY NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL
ORGANISATIONS'. THIS THEME IS CONSIDERED TO BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE ON AN
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AS IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL WITH VARIOUS ASPECTS
OF NATIONAL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION WITH SPECIAL
EMPHASIS ON THE EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS, PROFESSIONAL METHODICAL
CENTRES AND NATIONAL SERVICE FACILITIES FOR LIBRARIES. ABOUT 1,200 PEOPLE ARE
EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE WHICH WIL BE THE LARGEST CULTURAL EVENT YET

THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF AZ ORVOSI KONYVTAROS (MEDICAL LIBRARIAN).IN 195
     
6, THE 'REVIEW OF MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP' WAS PUBLISHED BY THE HUNGARIAN
MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE (SUCCEEDED BY THE MEDICAL INFORMATION CENTRE).
ONLY 2 ISSUES APPEARED, BUT ITS SUCCESSOR AZ ORVOSI KONYVTAROS WAS ESTABLISHED
IN 1961. NOW, 20 YEARS LATER, 80 ISSUES HAVE APPEARED, CARRYING 834 ARTICLES.
ANALYSES THE CONTENTS AND PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE PRODUCTION OF THE JOURNAL.
STANDARDISATION IN THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY' THE CURRENT
SITUATION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS.
     
STANDARDS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
THE IMPROVING OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. THEIR RELEVANCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP
INCLUDES IMPROVING READER SERVICES, MAXIMISING USE OF RESOURCES, ACCOUNTING
PROCEDURES AND INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION. IN 1976-78 EXISTING STANDARDS
RELATING TO LIBRARIES WERE REVISED AND COORDINATED AND A LONG-TERM PROGRAMME
OF STANDARDISATION COVERING INFORMATION WORK, LIBRARIANSHIP AND PUBLISHING WAS
INITIATED. ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AFFECTED BY STANDARDS INTRODUCED SINCE
THEN INCLUDE' THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC AND MAPS, REFERENCE
BOOKS IN SERVICE POINTS, BASIC TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
WORK, AND A SINGLE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS.
BULGARIAN PERIODICALS AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE ON LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
ONE OF THE SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES PUBLISHED BY THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS
NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA COVERS LITERATURE ON LIBRARIANSHIP, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE. FROM 1967-76, 4330 HEADINGS WERE LISTED. MORE THAN 90%
WERE ARTICLES AND SPECIAL PAPERS, AND ONLY THE REMAINING 10% INCLUDED BOOKS.
NATIONAL DAILIES AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND LOCAL PAPERS ALSO PAID ATTENTION TO
LIBRARIES. THEY EMPHASISED, HOWEVER, MOSTLY GENERAL ISSUES OR TOPICS OF LOCAL
INTEREST AND TIMING FREQUENCY AS WELL AS STANDARDS VARIED CONSIDERABLY. SINCE
1954, 2BIBLIOTEKAR1 HAS BEEN ALMOST THE ONLY STABLE PERIODICAL FOR LIBRARIANS
AND HAS SO FAR REMAINED THE ONLY BULGARIAN PERIODICAL OF THIS KIND KNOWN AND
ABSTRACTED ABROAD. INFORMATION SCIENTISTS HAVE LACKED THEIR OWN SPECIAL
PERIODICAL. THE GAP HAS BEEN PARTLY FILLED BY THE EFFORT OF THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY OF THE BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
MAKING LIBRARY RESEARCH RESULTS PAY.
     
EXAMINES GOOD (EVEN SOPHISTICATED) PRACTICE IN THE FIELD OF FINDING AND USING
RESEARCH RESULTS, COVERING PATTERNS OF COMMUNICATION, THE LITERATURE SEARCH,
HANDLING SEARCH RESULTS, PROBLEMS, BUILDING ON PREVIOUS RESEARCH, AND
STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING RESEARCH.
A LIBRARY SCIENCE RESEARCH READER AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC GUIDE.
     
A COLLECTION OF ESSAYS AIMING' TO STIMULATE MORE INTEREST IN THE PURSUIT OF
SYSTEMATIC INQUIRY PERTAINING TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE; TO HELP
POTENTIAL RESEARCH WORKERS GAIN A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF SELECTED STRATEGIES
FOR THE CONDUCT OF STUDIES, THE ANALYSIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA, AND THE EVALUATION
OF COMPLETED RESEARCH PROJECTS; TO ACQUAINT READERS WITH SOME IMPORTANT
CONSIDERATIONS FOR PLANNING STUDIES AND OBTAINING FUNDS TO UNDERTAKE PROJECTS;
AND TO PROVIDE USEFUL LISTS OF ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF PUBLISHED INFORMATION
ABOUT RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND ITS METHODS. INCLUDES PAPERS BY' CHARLES
H. BUSHA, LAUREL GROTZINGER, JEFFREY KATZER, CAROL MCCOMBS, STEPHEN B. WALTER,
AND CAROLYN GRADDICK TEAL, WITH A BIBLIOGRAPHY COMPILED BY CHARLES H. BUSHA.
THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM ON RESEARCH IN
DOCUMENTATION (ISORID).
     
A READING OF THE AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM
ON RESEARCH IN DOCUMENTATION (ISORID), A JOINT UNESCO-FID OPERATION, REVEALS
THAT THE SYSTEM HAS MET AS YET UNRESOLVED STRESSES THAT HINDER THE EFFECTIVE
CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY THAT THIS SYSTEM WAS EXPECTED TO MAKE. A
QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON WITH THE US-BASED 2LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES
TODAY1 (LIST) IS NOT KIND TO ISORID AND REFLECTS THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY THAT
ISORID HAS WITH ITS ESSENTIALLY COOPERATIVE BASIS FOR GATHERING DATA. THE
THEORETICAL BASIS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL REGISTER APPEARS SOUND, BUT
PRACTICALITIES ARE HINDERING ITS EFFECTIVENESS TO THE FIELDS OF DOCUMENTATION,
INFORMATION SCIENCE, AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
THE STATE OF RESEARCH IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN QUEBEC' SURVEY
RESULTS.
     
IN ORDER TO FULFILL ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE MANDATE CONFERRED UPON IT IN
JUNE 79, THE RESEARCH COMMITTEE IN LIBRARIANSHIP CONDUCTED A SURVEY TO FIND
OUT WHETHER QUEBEC LIBRARIANS ARE RESEARCH-MINDED. THE 203 QUESTIONNAIRES
RECEIVED, STUDIED AND ANALYSED, GIVE WITNESS TO SOME INTERESTING PROJECTS AND
REALISATIONS. BUT GIVEN THE TIME AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL CLIMATE, ONE QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED' WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF
RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP IN QUEBEC?.
LIFE AND WORK OF PROFESSOR ARNTZ. AN FID TRIBUTE.
     
PAPER BASED ON AN ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE FID CONGRESS BANQUET, HELD IN
COPENHAGEN 21 AUG 80. HIGHLIGHTS THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF
PROFESSOR H. ARNTZ IN THE FIELD OF DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND
TRACES HIS EARLY CAREER AND INTEREST IN MICROFILMS AND REPROGRAPHY. REVIEWS
THE ACTIVITIES OF FID WHEN PROFESSOR ARNTZ WAS PRESIDENT AND PAYS TRIBUTE TO
HIS WORK AND ACHIEVEMENTS WITHIN THE FEDERATION.
CARLOS E. CASTANEDA'S RENDEZVOUS WITH A LIBRARY' THE LATIN AMERICAN
COLLECTION, 1920-1927-THE FIRST PHASE.W
     
HILST CARLOS EDUARDO CASTANEDA ACHIEVED DISTINCTION AS A 1ST RATE HISTORIAN OF
THE SOUTHERN BORDERLANDS OF THE USA, MANY ARE UNAWARE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS HE
MADE TO THE PROFESSIONS OF HISTORY AND LIBRARY SCIENCE. DESCRIBES THE PERIOD
FROM 1920, WHEN CASTANEDA 1ST HEARD THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS WAS TO
ACQUIRE 'THE FINEST AND MOST EXTENSIVE HISTORICAL AND LITERARY COLLECTION OF
MEXICO', TO 1927, WHEN HE BECAME LIBRARIAN OF THE BENSON LATIN AMERICAN
COLLECTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN.
CARMEN DIANA DEARDEN' EDITOR AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE VENEZUELAN BANCO
DEL LIBRO.
     
AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE CHIEF PRIVATE VENEZUELAN
ORGANISATION CONCERNED WITH SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL
PUBLISHING. A BRIEF SUMMARY IS GIVEN OF HER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH BANCO DEL
LIBRO IN ORGANISING A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE. THE DISCUSSION COVERS LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH STATE COOPERATION;
ACTIVITIES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL; AND PUBLISHING PROJECTS UNDER THE
SPONSORSHIP OF EKARE, THE BANCO DEL LIBRO PUBLISHING HOUSE.
FRANCES NEWMAN' LIBRARIAN AND NOVELIST.
     
BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF FRANCES NEWMAN, (BORN IN ATLANTA IN 1888), WHO WAS BOTH
LIBRARIAN AND NOVELIST. DISCUSSES HER WRITING AS A REFLECTION OF THE SOCIAL
AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE PERIOD UP TO HER DEATH IN 1928.
AZARIAH SMITH ROOT AND SOCIAL REFORM AT OBERLIN COLLEGE.
     
AZARIAH SMITH ROOT WAS BORN IN MIDDLEFIELD, MASSACHUSSETTS, IN 1862. IN 1885,
HAVING GAINED MA AND BA DEGREES, HE ASSUMED A TEMPORARY POSITION CATALOGUING
THE LIBRARY COLLECTIONS AT OBERLIN COLLGE. IN 1887 HE WAS ELECTED COLLEGE
LIBRARIAN, A POSITION WHICH HE HELD UNTIL HIS DEATH 40 YEARS LATER. DISCUSSES
ROOT'S SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY, THE COLLEGE AND ITS HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO REFORMIST
NOTIONS, (IN 1835 IT ADMITTED BLACK STUDENTS, AND IN 1837 BECAME THE USA'S 1ST
COEDUCATIONAL COLLEGE), AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ROOT AND HIS OBERLIN
COLLEAGUES.
OSCAR G.T. SONNECK: ARCHITECT OF THE 'NATIONAL MUSIC COLLECTION'.
     
DISCUSSES THE WORK OF OSCAR GEORGE THEODORE SONNECK, (BORN IN NEW JERSEY IN
1873), WHO AS CHIEF OF THE MUSIC DIVISION, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, PRODUCED A
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE LIBRARY'S MUSIC COLLECTIONS, ASSEMBLED A VAST
GENERAL COLLECTION AND SPECIALISED COLLECTIONS, AND MAY JUSTLY BE DESCRIBED AS
THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC LIBRARIANSHIP.
LIBRARY PROFESSION OF INDIA AT CROSS ROADS.
     
TRACES THE GENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IN INDIA FROM
1924 WHEN MADRAS UNIVERSITY CREATED A LIBRARIAN'S POST WITH A STATUS AND
SALARY SCALE WORTHY OF A PROFESSION. DISCUSSES THE STATUS AND PRESTIGE OF
LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS AND MAKES A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SALARY SCALES IN 1959
AND 1969. DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATION AND LIBRARY
TECHNIQUES AND SUGGESTS MEANS BY WHICH THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION
CAN BE RAISED.
EDUCATING THE POTENTIAL SELF-CENSOR.
     
A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE DEVOTED TO CENSORSHIP ON
THE SELECTION BEHAVIOUR OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AND EDUCATION MAJORS.
DRAMATIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CENSORSHIP CASES.
     
INTERVIEWS JUDITH F. KRUG, LEADER OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S OFFICE
FOR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM. ITS WORK IS BASED ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION AND ON THE ALA'S LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS. IT BEGAN AS THE
INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM COMMITTEE IN 1940. UNTIL RECENTLY ALMOST ALL CASES CAME
FROM SCHOOL LIBRARIES, BUT SINCE THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE THE
MOST IMPORTANT CASES ORIGINATE WITH THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE OFFICE, HOWEVER,
DOES NOT CONFINE ITSELF TO TAKING UP CASES WITHIN THE LIBRARY SECTOR, BUT IT
KEEPS LIBRARIANS AND THE PUBLIC INFORMED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST
AMENDMENT, ISSUES PUBLICATIONS, AND HOLDS SEMINARS. MANY ATTEMPTS AT
CENSORSHIP COME FROM THE MORAL MAJORITY MOVEMENT. THE OFFICE FINDS IT EASIER
TO DEAL WITH LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE A CLEARLY FORMULATED SELECTION POLICY, AND
IN VERY FEW CASES DOES IT RECOMMEND REFUSAL TO ACQUIRE A PARTICULAR BOOK. THE
LEGAL SIDE OF ALA IS DEALT WITH BY A SEPARATE,  BUT RELATED BODY, THE FREEDOM
TO READ FOUNDATION.
THE YOUNG ADULT AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM IN THE LIBRARY. A SELECTIVE
BIBLIOGRAPHY AND CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE.
     
DESIGNED FOR LIBRARIANS PLANNING COMMUNITY ORIENTED PROGRAMMES, THIS ANNOTATED
BIBLIOGRAPHY CRITICALLY REVIEWS LITERATURE DEFENDING THE YOUNG ADULT'S RIGHT
TO INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ANNUAL REVIEWS AS INDICATORS OF THE DEVELOPING STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC
DISCIPLINES.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND.) EXAMINES THE 2ANNUAL REVIEW OF
INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY1 FROM 1966-75, FOR EVIDENCE OF THE
DEVELOPING INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE OF THE DISCIPLINE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE.
THIS STRUCTURE IS VIEWED AS BEING COMPOSED OF THE CONCEPTS WHICH FORM THE
INTELLECTUAL TERRITORY OF THE DISCIPLINE AND THEIR ORGANISATION INTO TOPICS
RESEARCH AREAS AND SUB-FIELDS. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF REVIEW LITERATURE IS SEEN
TO BE THE MAPPING OF THE INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE OF THE DISCIPLINE. EXAMINES
CONCEPTS UNDERLYING AUTHORS' NATURAL LANGUAGE. ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE A MODEL OF
THE LIFE CYCLE OF A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE, AND SUGGESTS A NUMBER OF FOLLOW-UP
STUDIES.
MEASUREMENT IN INFORMATION SCIENCE' OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE METRICAL SPACE.
     
IT IS ARGUED THAT IN INFORMATION SCIENCE WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH PHYSICAL,
OBJECTIVE, OR DOCUMENT SPACE FROM PERSPECTIVE, SUBJECTIVE, OR INFORMATION
SPACE. THESE 2 SPACES ARE LIKE MAPS AND LANDSCAPES' EACH IS A SYSTEMATIC
DISTORTION OF THE OTHER. HOWEVER, TRANSFORMATIONS CAN BE EASILY MADE ONCE THE
2 SPACES ARE DISTINGUISHED.
MYSTERIES OF THE DEEP' MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE OF KNOWLEDGE.
     
EVIDENCE OF THE USE, BY SCHOLARS AND OTHERS, OF MENTAL CONSTRUCTS OR MODELS OF
SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS IS PRESENTED TO ILLUSTRATE A NON-VERBAL
KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE TO EFFORTS TO
CONSTRUCT MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE OF KNOWLEDGE IS STATED, NOTING THE DANGER IN
SUCH MODELS.
AN EXTRAPOLATION APPROACH TO THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THE TRIAD 'DATA-INFORMATION-KNOWLEDGE' AND STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF
EXTRAPOLATION IN RELATION TO THE KNOWLEDGE ASPECT OF THIS CONCEPT. SHOWS THE
VARIETY OF FORMS WHICH EXTRAPOLATION MAY TAKE WHEN OBTAINING INFORMATION ON
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.
THE CONCEPTION OF PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INFORMATION FROM THE POINT
OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION OF SYMBOLS.
     
USING THE UNIVERSAL MODEL OF TRANSFORMATION OF INFORMATION AND THROUGH
STRUCTURE OF DATA FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF REFLECTION, THE
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY
INFORMATION ARE OUTLINED. ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE SYMBOL IS A REFLECTION OF
PHENOMENA OR A REFLECTION OF A SYMBOL (SIGN), VARIOUS ORDERS OF THE REFLECTION
ARE RECOGNISED, I.E. THE ORDER OF THE SYMBOL REFLECTION. THUS PRIMARY
INFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF A PHENOMENON DEPOSITED WITHOUT A SIGN/MARK,
SECONDARY INFORMATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE DEPOSITED SIGNS, ETC. THE
STATEMENT GIVING THE SPACE AND TIME IN WHICH A PHENOMENON IS VALID IS CALLED
THE ADDRESS.
THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN.
     
THE CAREER OF A LIBRARIAN SHOULD COMBINE THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF LIBRARIANSHIP
WITH ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH. NOWADAYS NEW RESEARCH IN LIBRARY SCIENCE
IS USUALLY CARRIED OUT IN TEAMS RATHER THAN BY INDIVIDUALS. MODERN LIBRARIANS
HAVE TO POSSESS A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE COVERING MANY FIELDS AND IT IS NO
LONGER USUAL FOR A LIBRARIAN TO BE AN EXPERT IN ONLY 1 SUBJECT. TEACHERS AT
LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN PART-TIME LIBRARIANS AND PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF DAILY LIBRARY ACTIVITY, WHICH PREVENTS COURSES FROM BECOMING
MERELY THEORETICAL. THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IS REFLECTED
IN THE SYLLABUSES OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS WHICH DEVOTE MORE TIME TO CURRENT LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECTS THAN BEFORE.
ARCHIVIST AND COMPREHENSIVIST.
     
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE VASTLY EXPANDED THE ARCHIVAL REALM. THE
ARCHIVIST RISKS BEING OUT OF TUNE WITH THE NEEDS OF ELECTRONIC TIMES. TODAY
THE 'COMPLETE' ARCHIVIST IS REQUIRED TO PLAY AN EVER WIDENING
INTERDISCIPLINARY ROLE. THE SPECIALIST MUST NOW BECOME THE COMPREHENSIVIST WHO
CAN USE THE APPROPRIATE HARDWARE WITH ALL HIS WITS AND SENSES.
IFLA DURING THE PRESIDENCY OF GUSTAV HOFMANN (1958-1963).
     
IN 1958 GUSTAV HOFMANN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF IFLA IN MADRID. HE WAS THE
GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARIES. DURING HIS PERIOD OF OFFICE
AS PRESIDENT OF THE IFLA FROM 1958-63 HOFMANN PROMOTED AND CARRIED OUT A GREAT
DEAL OF STRUCTURAL REORGANISATION INCLUDING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE REVISION OF
THE ARTICLES AND THE CONSTITUTION OF IFLA. THE ASSOCIATION GREW RAPIDLY DURING
THIS TIME AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO ORGANISE IT ALONG FEDERAL LINES WITH
VICE-PRESIDENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS. HOFMANN
SUCCESSFULLY ENGAGED PEOPLE IN IFLA PROJECTS AND CONTRIBUTED ACTIVELY HIMSELF.
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS' THEIR ROLE AND UTILITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
OF LIBRARY EDUCATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND REVIEWS THE CONTRIBUTION
OF THE UK LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO LIBRARY
EDUCATION. HIGHLIGHTS THE EDUCATION ACTIVITIES OF THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL
ASSOCIATIONS IN INDIA. REVEALS THAT MOST OF THE CERTIFICATE COURSES IN INDIA
ARE RUN BY ASSOCIATIONS. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS IN COLLABORATION
WITH UNIVERSITIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD TRY TO IMPROVE THE PROFESSION
THROUGH STANDARD METHODS OF LIBRARY EDUCATION.
JOHN HARRIS' NZ'S GIFT TO NIGERIAN LIBRARY EDUCATION.
     
NEW ZEALANDER JOHN HARRIS (1903-80) ARRIVED IN NIGERIA IN 1948 TO BE LIBRARIAN
OF THE FLEDGELING UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, IBADAN. HE ALMOST SINGLE-HANDEDLY
CREATED NIGERIA'S PREMIER ACADEMIC PRESS AND, WITH HIS WIFE, ITS 1ST
UNIVERSITY BOOKSHOP. HE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN FORMING THE WEST AFRICAN
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND INITIATED THE 1ST FORMAL LIBRARY EDUCATION COURSE IN
NIGERIA. THANKS LARGELY TO HIM, THE 1ST LIBRARY SCHOOL IN NIGERIA, THE
INSTITUTE OF LIBRARIANSHIP, WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1959 WITH A GRANT FROM THE
CARNEGIE CORPORATION-THIS IN THE FACE OF COMPETITION FROM OTHER WEST AFRICAN
STATES WISHING TO ESTABLISH SUCH A BODY.
EVEN AFTER 8 YEARS WITHIN THE COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY, LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING
IS STILL A CRISIS AREA.
     
ALTHOUGH NATIONAL GUIDELINES WERE DRAWN UP ON LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING, EACH
WEST GERMAN STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM, THEREFORE
CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS STILL EXIST CONCERNING LEGAL STATUS OF LIBRARY
SCHOOLS, ENTRY REQUIREMENTS, CURRICULA FOR COMPULSORY AND OPTIONAL SUBJECTS
AND ORGANISATION OF COURSES FOR PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. SOME SUBJECTS
ARE NOT TAUGHT AT ALL IN SOME SCHOOLS AND GENERALLY RELATED SUBJECTS ARE SPLIT
UP TOO MUCH. MANY LECTURERS PLACE TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON FORMAL LECTURES' MANY
STUDENTS ARE UNINTERESTED IN THEIR STUDIES. TRAINING COURSES MUST DEVELOP
STUDENTS' CRITICAL FACULTIES, ENCOURAGE CREATIVITY AND PROMOTE ACTIVE
COMMUNICATION WITH READERS AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS; BETTER
ORGANISATION AND MORE UNIFICATION AMONG LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED.
STUDENTS CRITICISE THE SITUATION CONCERNING TRAINING AT STUTTGART LIBRARY
SCHOOL.
     
REPORT OF DISCUSSION AT A WEEKEND SEMINAR, STUTTGART, JAN 81. MANY STUDENTS
HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING ACCOMMODATION BUT,
COMPARED WITH OTHER COURSES, FEW DROP OUT AND STUDENT-STAFF RELATIONSHIPS ARE
GOOD. LIBRARIANSHIP STUDIES SHOULD DEVELOP CRITICAL FACULTIES AND THE ABILITY
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH READERS. THE LIBRARY MUST BECOME A COMMUNICATION CENTRE,
UP TO DATE AND OPEN TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. REGIONAL NEEDS SHOULD BE EMPHASISED
RATHER THAN NATIONAL STANDARDISATION. LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES SHOULD CONTAIN NEW
FIELDS OF STUDY, LIKE SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES. SOME FORMAL LECTURES
SHOULD BE REPLACED BY SMALL STUDY GROUPS, EXAMINATION PROCEDURES SHOULD BE
IMPROVED AND BETTER USE MADE OF PRACTICAL TRAINING PERIODS.
AN EXPERIMENT IN M LIB SC TEACHING.
     
PRESENTS AN ANALYTICAL VIEW OF THE M LIB SC COURSE WHICH IS BEING OFFERED AT
BOMBAY UNIVERSITY. COMPARES THE COURSE CONTENT AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS
COURSE WITH THOSE AT DELHI UNIVERSITY AND BENARAS HINDU UNIVERSITY. ANALYSES
IN DETAIL THE METHOD OF TEACHING, EXAMINATION PATTERN AND OTHER RELATED
ASPECTS OF BOMBAY UNIVERSITY AND COMPARES THEM WITH THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES
OFFERING M LIB SC COURSES. CONCLUDES THAT THE BOMBAY UNIVERSITY COURSE HAS
STARTED A NEW EXPERIMENT WHERE REGULAR CLASSES ARE NOT REQUIRED AND NO
FULL-TIME TEACHERS ARE PROVIDED.
ON THE EXTENSION TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS.
     
SUMMARISES THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR EXTENSION TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS IN
HUNGARY SINCE 1963. APART FROM LECTURES AND COURSES, EXTENSION TRAINING MAY
ALSO TAKE THE FORM OF STUDY TOURS, THESES FOR DOCTORATES AND INDIVIDUAL
STUDIES FOR THE COMPLEMENTARY COLLEGE-LEVEL STATE EXAMINATIONS. DESCRIBES THE
DIFFERENT TRAINING ORGANISATIONS AND THE CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE IN THIS FIELD'
THE CENTRE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE AND METHODOLOGY AT THE NATIONAL SZECHENYI
LIBRARY (OSZK KMK); SPECIAL LIBRARIES; PUBLIC LIBRARIES; SCHOOL LIBRARIES; AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARIANS WHICH HELPS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PROFESSION WITH PROFESSIONAL DEBATES AND WITH RESEARCH WORK CARRIED OUT WITHIN
ITS SECTIONS. PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF EXTENSION
TRAINING WITHIN THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE OSZK KMK.
THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED DURING SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARY
STUDIES AT THE PHILOSOPHICAL FACULTY OF CHARLES UNIVERSITY IN INFORMATION
PRACTICE.
     
THE THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE GAINED DURING STUDIES IN THE 4-YEAR LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION COURSE AT THE PHILOSOPHICAL FACULTY OF CHARLES UNIVERSITY IN
PRAGUE IS COMPARED WITH THE AUTHOR'S 20 YEARS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF WORKING
IN AN INFORMATION CENTRE IN A BRANCH OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. THE DEMANDS
PLACED ON THE STUDENT FALL INTO 3 CATEGORIES' KNOWLEDGE OF THE METHODOLOGY AND
TECHNIQUES OF INFORMATION WORK (THE SYLLABUS OF THE SUBJECTS FORMING THE
INFORMATION CORE IS PRESENTED IN SOME DETAIL); KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES;
SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE (SUBJECT SPECIALISATION). LISTS THE AREAS IN WHICH STUDY OF
INFORMATION THEORY HAS HELPED IN PRACTICAL WORK.
WHEN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WANTS TO ALTER ITS ROAD-MAP.
     
REACTIONS OF LIBRARIANS TO RECENT PROPOSALS (TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE 1976-77
REPORTS ON POSSIBLE ELEVATION TO UNIVERSITY STATUS) FOR A NEW CURRICULUM IN
THE NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL. POINTS COVERED INCLUDE THE PROPOSED 2-YEAR
COMMON COURSE, WITH SPECIALISATION IN THE 3RD YEAR (GENERALLY APPROVED);
METHODS SUBJECTS (BIBLIOGRAPHY IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY, BUT SOME CONSIDER
COMPUTER STUDIES NOWADAYS EQUALLY ESSENTIAL); LITERATURE AND SOCIETY (THOUGHT
TO MERIT MORE ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, POPULAR LITERATURE,
AND SERVICES TO HANDICAPPED AND IMMIGRANTS); INFORMATION SCIENCE (SHOULD BE
INCLUDED IN 2 OR EVEN 3 YEARS); ADMINISTRATION (CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL); PRACTICAL TRAINING (SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXTENDED); EVALUATION OF
STUDENTS' WORK (GENERAL OPINION FAVOURS THE RETENTION OF MARKING TOGETHER WITH
CONTINUOUS EVALUATION); LECTURING STAFF (LIBRARY EXPERIENCE IS PREFERRED TO
ACADEMIC SPECIALISATION); INTAKE OF STUD ENTS (AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SHOULD COVER
THE WHOLE COUNTRY). BETTER LIAISON ON EDUCATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND LIBRARY
PROFESSION IS FELT DESIRABLE, BUT THERE SEEMS NO MAJOR DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND LIBRARIANS IN THE FIELD.
THIS ONE-SIDED PRAXIS-WORSHIP.
     
A NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENT REBUTS 3 CLAIMS MADE BY PREVIOUS
WRITERS (SPECIAL SECTION ON LIBRARY EDUCATION IN NORWAY, 2IBID1 46 (8) 1979;
2SEE1 81/60)' (1) THAT LECTURERS HAVE TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE
(&H HAVE EXTENSIVE LIBRARY EXPERIENCE, WHILE THE OTHERS MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
CURRENT LIBRARY PRACTICE); (2) THAT THE COURSE CONTAINS TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL
TRAINING (THE NEW 3-YEAR THEORETICAL CURRICULUM IS A STEP FORWARD. INTERNAL
AND EXTERNAL PRACTICAL WORK, THOUGH STILL NECESSARY, ARE OF LIMITED VALUE IN A
CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING NATIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL'S PRIMARY TASK IS TO
EDUCATE INDEPENDENT, CRITICAL LIBRARIANS WHO CAN EVALUATE THEIR ROLE IN A
SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND BE OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE); AND (3) THAT
INSTRUCTION IS TOO THEORETICAL (ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO
OVER-VALUE DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK, VIEWING LIBRARIANSHIP AS A SERVICE
INDUSTRY RATHER THAN A SCHOLARLY DISCIPLINE). A MORE LIBRARY /SOCIOLOGICAL-
AND PROJECT-ORIENTED CURRICULUM IS NEEDED, CALLING FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
COMMITMENT FROM BOTH STUDENTS AND LECTURERS.
BREADTH, SPECIALISATION AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING.
     
REPORTS ON A MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE SET UP TO REVISE THE DANISH LIBRARY
SCHOOL ACT. BOTH THE COURSES EXISTING TODAY, THE ONE FOR PUBLIC AND THE ONE
FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIANS, HAVE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD BE RETAINED IN ANY FUTURE
COMMON FOUNDATION COURSE. SUCH A COURSE SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS'
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION AND CULTURE, ITS PRECONDITIONS, FORMS AND AIM;
EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; INTERNAL ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION; AND SKILLS
AND TECHNIQUES. SPECIALISATION, IF ANY, COULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL
PROJECTS OR SUBSIDIARY COURSES. INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF IN-SERVICE COURSES
WAS CALLED FOR, FINANCED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE CAPACITY OF THE SCHOOL. THE
MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AGREES TO AN ORGANISATIONAL DIVISION INTO 2
SECTIONS' FOUNDATION COURSE AND FURTHER COURSES.
TEACHING BOOK AND PERIODICAL INDEXING AT LIVERPOOL.
     
DESCRIBES THE METHODS USED BY THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
STUDIES AT LIVERPOOL POLYTECHNIC TO TEACH MODERN INDEXING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS
CHAIN INDEXING, PRECIS, AND THE APPLICATIONS OF THE COMPUTER. GIVES THE SCALE
OF MARKING USED, AND INCLUDES EXTRACTS FROM 2 OF THE PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY
STUDENTS' AN INDEX TO VOLUMES 1-8 OF A LOCAL HISTORY JOURNAL 2THE
BLACKCOUNTRYMAN; 1AND THE INDEXING OF THE 2NORTH-WESTERN NEWSLETTER, 1A
PERIODICAL PUBLISHED BY THE NORTH WESTERN BRANCH OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
AND THE NORTH WEST DIVISION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS BETWEEN
1950 AND 1975.
LIBRARY PROVISION OF MUSIC-A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE TEACHING OF MUSIC LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL.
MENTIONS A SWEDISH PROTEST LETTER AGAINST THE PROPOSED ABOLITION OF SUCH
TEACHING. ALTHOUGH ABOLITION IS NOT SUGGESTED IN DENMARK, MUCH IN THE LETTER
IS APPLICABLE TO DANISH CONDITIONS. IT THUS POINTS OUT THAT LIBRARIES WITH
THEIR NON-COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVES CAN COUNTERACT THE PREDOMINANCE OF LARGE
FOREIGN RECORD COMPANIES. IT ARGUES THAT NOW THAT MUSIC DEPARTMENTS IN
LIBRARIES ARE BEING REDUCED, LIBRARIANS SHOULD RECEIVE MORE INSTRUCTION IN
MUSIC LIBRARIANSHIP SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES.
NOW WHEN THE TRAINING IS TO BE REVISED, THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE GRASPED TO
GIVE MUSIC A HIGHER PRIORITY IN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL.
EDUCATION FOR RARE BOOK LIBRARIANSHIP' A REEXAMINATION OF TRENDS AND PROBLEMS.
     
EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT AT LIBRARY SCHOOLS
FAVOURING ADVANCED EDUCATION FOR ARCHIVAL OR RARE BOOK LIBRARIANSHIP. COURSE
OFFERINGS AT 64 ACCREDITED LIBRARY SCHOOLS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING TRAINING FOR
RARE BOOK LIBRARIANSHIP WERE ANALYSED. THESE DATA ARE COMPARED WITH COMPARABLE
FIGURES FOR OTHER COURSE OFFERINGS, PLACEMENT STATISTICS, AND PREVIOUS SURVEY
DATA, GIVING A GENERAL PICTURE OF NEGLECT OF THIS FIELD. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE
FROM NTIS.
THE IMPACT OF LRC CONCEPT ON MEDIA EDUCATION.
     
REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEARNING RESOURCES CENTRE (LRC) CONCEPT AND THE
INTEGRATED LIBRARY MEDIA EDUCATION PROGRAMME IN THE USA; EXAMINES STUDIES
RELATED TO LIBRARY MEDIA EDUCATION; PROPOSES A CURRICULUM FOR A FULLY
INTEGRATED MEDIA EDUCATION PROGRAMME IN US LIBRARY SCHOOLS; AND DISCUSSES THE
IMPORTANCE OF SUCH A CURRICULUM CHANGE.
REPORT TO BLR&DD ON THE USE OF FORM DESIGNS FOR CATALOGUE INPUT' A PROJECT
INVOLVING THE HP2645A DISPLAY STATION.
     
DESCRIBES AN INVESTIGATION OF THE POTENTIAL OF A HEWLETT PACKARD HP2645A
TERMINAL IN TEACHING ON-LINE CATALOGUING, INCLUDING THE USE OF THE TERMINAL'S
EDITING FACILITIES, AND AN INVESTIGATION OF THE VALUE AND USEFULNESS OF
VARIOUS FORM OVERLAY DESIGNS FOR THE INPUT OF MARC CATALOGUING DATA. DIFFERENT
FORM DESIGNS ARE COMPARED THROUGH A STUDY OF THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED AND
THE ERRORS MADE BY A TEST GROUP CONSISTING MAINLY OF STUDENTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP.
INSTRUCTION TAPES FOR THE HP2645A.
     
THE AIMS OF THE PROJECT TEAM WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE FACILITIES OF THE HP2645A
TERMINAL, AND TO DEMONSTRATE ITS POTENTIAL AS A TEACHING TOOL, PARTICULARLY IN
RELATION TO THE TEACHING OF CATALOGUING. TWO TRIAL TAPES WERE PRODUCED TO RUN
ON THE TERMINAL. ONE WAS A PROGRAMMED TEXT ON CHAPTER 21 OF AACR2 (CHOICE OF
MAIN ENTRY), AND THE OTHER WAS AN INTRODUCTION TO MARC CATALOGUING. THE REPORT
DESCRIBES THE TAPES AND THE REACTIONS TO THEM OF A GROUP OF LIBRARIANSHIP
STUDENTS.
NEW TECHNIQUES IN THE TEACHING OF ONLINE SEARCHING. AN INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY
EDUCATORS (SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, MARCH 20-24, 1978). EXHIBITS AND SUMMARIES OF
PRESENTATIONS.
     
USING DATA BASES OF THE DIALOG SYSTEM NEW TEACHING TECHNIQUES AND MATERIALS
ARE PRESENTED TO AN AUDIENCE OF LIBRARY EDUCATORS. INCLUDED ARE SEARCH
DEMONSTRATIONS, TEACHING APPROACHES, SAMPLE EXERCISES AND INSTRUCTIONAL
PROJECTS, MULTI-DATE BASE SEARCHING METHODS, UTILISATION OF SEARCH AIDS AND
OFF-LINE RESOURCES, THE CONDUCT OF PRESEARCH INTERVIEWS, INFORMATION SEARCH
TACTICS, AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME PLANING. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
WITH BOOK ANALYSES AGAINST MORGAN KANE.
     
THE FINAL SESSION (NOV 79) OF A COMPULSORY COURSE FOR NORWEGIAN PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS DEALT WITH BOOK KNOWLEDGE, EVALUATION AND SELECTION. BASED ON
GENERAL NOVELS, IT ALSO INCLUDED HIGH QUALITY AND POPULAR LITERATURE,
INTRODUCING SYSTEMATIC BOOK ANALYSIS AND PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY. ASSIGNING
NOVELS TO GENRES WITH THE AIM OF SUPPLYING ALTERNATIVES TO SUBSTANDARD
LITERATURE (SUCH AS MORGAN KANE) WAS SEEN AS BEING PARTICULARLY USEFUL. THE
ART OF SKIMMING THROUGH A BOOK AND GRASPING ITS ESSENTIALS WAS PRACTISED.
STUDY OF BOOK REVIEWS REVEALED THAT EVALUATIONS OF THE SAME BOOK CAN DIFFER
WIDELY. AIDS TO BOOK SELECTION (ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO RURAL LIBRARIANS WITH
NO LOCAL BOOKSHOP) WERE DISCUSSED. 2 EVENING SESSIONS ON POETRY WERE HELD.
STUDENTS RETURNED TO THEIR LIBRARIES WITH A NEW INTEREST IN FICTION AND GOOD
INTENTIONS OF LEADING READERS, PARTICULARLY TEENAGERS, TOWARDS BETTER-QUALITY
LITERATURE.
PARAPROFESSIONAL WORKERS IN FOUR FIELDS' A COMPARATIVE STUDY.
     
COMPARES THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY TECHNICIANS WITH
THAT OF PARAPROFESSIONALS IN SOCIAL WORK, MEDICINE, AND ARCHITECTURE.
DISCUSSES THE EMERGENCE OF THE CONCEPT OF PARAPROFESSIONALISM; ROLES OF
PROFESSIONAL AND PARAPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS; GOVERNMENT POLICY AND FUNDING;
ROLE AND TASKS OF PARAPROFESSIONALS; MANPOWER NEEDS; AND AVAILABILITY AND
LEVEL OF TRAINING COURSES. CONCLUDES THAT THE PROPORTION OF PARAPROFESSIONALS
IN ALL 4 FIELDS IS LIKELY TO INCREASE; REDISTRIBUTION OF TASKS BETWEEN
PROFESSIONALS AND PARAPROFESSIONALS WILL BE FELT THE MOST SEVERELY IN
LIBRARIANSHIP; AND IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IN ALL 4 FIELDS.
MISSOURI UNION LIST OF AUDIO-VISUALS ON LIBRARY EDUCATION.
     
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NON-BOOK MATERIALS ON LIBRARY/INFORMATION SCIENCE
REPRESENTING THE HOLDINGS OF 40 PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN MISSOURI.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
TEACHING AND LEARNING MATERIALS FOR INFORMATION TRAINING. A REVIEW OF RELEVANT
AIDS PRODUCED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THEIR SUITABILITY FOR USE IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN EAST AFRICA.
     
THE QUESTION OF INVESTIGATING THE NATURE AND AVAILABILITY OF UK-PRODUCED
TEACHING/LEARNING MATERIALS IN THE FIELD OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE AND EVALUATING THEIR SUITABILITY FOR USE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
ESPECIALLY EAST AFRICA, HAS BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION SINCE 1978. THIS REPORT
SURVEYS THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TEACHING/LEARNING MATERIALS AVAILABLE AND
DISCUSSES THEIR SUITABILITY IN THE CLASSROOM AND FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT.
USE OF MINIS, MICROS AND TERMINALS IN THE EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.
     
DISCUSSES THE USE MADE OF MINIS AND MICROCOMPUTERS WITHIN THE 16 UK LIBRARY
SCHOOLS TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING COMPUTER RESOURCES AND ENABLE MANY STUDENTS TO
HAVE HANDS ON ACCESS TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN A WIDE RANGE OF COURSES. ALSO

LIBRARY HISTORY IN BRITAIN' PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS.
     
LITERATURE REVIEW OF WRITINGS ON THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIES IN BRITAIN, WITH
SOME COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY HISTORY STUDY, BASED ON A SURVEY OF
BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS. APPENDED ARE A REPRINTED
QUESTIONNAIRE, AND A TABLE OF THE EARLIEST MATERIALS HELD BY UK LIBRARY
SYSTEMS.
FRANCE FROM THE LIBRARIAN'S VIEW.
     
COMPARED WITH THE USA, UK AND THE SCANDINAVIAN STATES FRANCE HAS AWAKENED FROM
ITS DREAM LATE TO TRY TO DEVELOP AN UP-TO-DATE LIBRARIANSHIP. IN RECENT YEARS
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE 5-STORY CENTRE
GEORGES POMPIDOU INAUGURATED IN 1976. IT IS A COMPLEX OF MUSEUM, LIBRARY,
BOOKSHOP, RECORD SHOP, CINEMAS, THEATRE, CONCERT HALL, I.E. A KIND OF CULTURAL
CENTRE. AFTER AN ACCOUNT OF THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE, DESCRIBES THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY OF THE PARIS MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAS 2 PARTS-AN OLDER AND AN
UP-TO-DATE HOLDING. OBSERVING CRITICALLY, THE LIBRARY OF THE PARIS MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY FALLS BEHIND THE MORE MECHANISED US ONES BUT THE LIBRARIES OF
HUNGARIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITIES HAVE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO TO REACH
THIS 'MODEST' LEVEL.
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES CELEBRATING NATIONAL HERITAGE YEAR IN FRANCE.
     
SURVEY OF THE NUMEROUS DIVERSE ACTIVITIES ORGANISED BY FRENCH LIBRARIES TO
MARK THE OCCASION IN 1980. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF EXHIBITIONS, CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES, PUBLICATIONS, INVENTORIES AND RESTORATION PROJECTS, AND NOTABLE
ACQUISITIONS, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARIES WHICH THE
PRESS TENDS TO IGNORE IN FAVOUR OF PARIS EVENTS.
THE FIRST IN RUSSIA.
     
10TH CENTURY CHRONICLES TELL HOW MANY RUSSIAN PRINCES ENJOYED BOOK-COLLECTING
AND FOUNDED SCHOOLS. AN 11TH CENTURY CHRONICLE DESCRIBES THE 1ST RUSSIAN
LIBRARY'S CREATION, THE YAROSLAV LIBRARY, CONTAINING ABOUT 500 VOLUMES. OUR
ANCESTORS READ DEVOTIONAL BOOKS, LIVES OF THE SAINTS, ENCYCLOPAEDIC WORKS, AND
GEOGRAPHY. THE KIEVO-PECHERSKII MONASTERY IN KIEV HAD A LARGE COLLECTION OF
RUSSIAN AND GREEK BOOKS. A COLLECTION OF RYAZAN LITERATURE AT THE NIKOLA
CHURCH IN ZARAISK EVIDENCES THE WIDE DISSEMINATION OF CULTURE. HALF OF ALL
SURVIVING 11TH TO 14TH CENTURY RUSSIAN BOOKS COME FROM NOVGOROD. THE SOFIISKOI
CATHEDRAL LIBRARY IN NOVGOROD ATTRACTED MONKS FROM DISTANT RUSSIAN MONASTERIES
TO TRANSCRIBE THE BOOKS.
CHINESE LIBRARIES DURING AND AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
     
PAPER BASED PRIMARILY ON DATA COLLECTED ON A VISIT IN 1978 TO THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. PROVIDES A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY OF CHINESE
LIBRARIES IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA, AND ATTEMPTS TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY ARE MEETING
THE CHALLENGES OF A CULTURE MOVING AWAY FROM ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM TO
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCHES, AND WHAT THEIR SALIENT PROBLEMS ARE.
THE WORK IS IN 3 MAIN SECTIONS' BEFORE THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, 1949-1966; THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION, 1966-1976; AND AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, 1976-.
WHEN THE NATIONAL LIBRARIAN AGAIN SPOKE HIS MIND.
     
COMMENTS ON THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
(DANMARKS FORSKNINGSBIBLIOTEKSFORENINGS) GIVEN BY PALLE BIRKELUND, THE
NATIONAL LIBRARIAN. DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE NOT GIVEN THE SUPPORT FROM
THE STATE IN THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WHICH THEY RECEIVE IN SWEDEN. HE EXPRESSED
FEARS THAT THE PROPOSED LIBRARY ACT, FAR FROM CREATING UNITY WITHIN THE DANISH
LIBRARY SERVICE, WOULD EMPHASISE THE DIVISION BETWEEN RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER
THE CULTURAL MINISTRY AND THOSE UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY. HE HOPED THAT
THE CULTURAL MINISTER WOULD NOT BE UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE DANISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WHEN FORMULATING THE LIBRARY ACT RELATED TO RESEARCH LIBRARIES.
INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THEM FOR LACK OF OPENNESS TO THE PUBLIC THE MINISTER
SHOULD SEE THAT ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE REMOVED.
LIBRARIES AND BOTANICAL GARDENS.
     
SUGGESTS THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO 3 PARTS' THE LIVING
COLLECTION, THE DRIED COLLECTION AND THE LIBRARY. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE
STERLING MORTON LIBRARY AT THE MORTON ARBORETUM, CHICAGO AND DEPLORES THE
BREAKING UP AND SELLING OFF OF SOME MAJOR BOTANICAL GARDENS IN EUROPE AND NEW
YORK. ALSO STRESSES THAT A LIBRARY IS MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF BOOKS-IT IS A
SELECTION FOR A PURPOSE, CHOSEN WITH CARE AND SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETELY
REPLACED BY ELECTRONIC MEDIA.
REPORT ON THE 4TH WORLD CONFERENCE OF MEDICAL LIBRARIANS, BELGRADE, 2-5
SEPTEMBER 80.
     
THE AIM OF THE CONGRESS WAS TO REVIEW CHANGES IN MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP SINCE
THE AMSTERDAM CONGRESS IN 1969, AND TO ANALYSE THE VARIEGATED PROBLEMS OF
MEDICAL LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP IN BIHAR. A CHALLENGE TO THE PROFESSION.
     
DESCRIBES THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AND PRESENTS
A VIEW OF THE PRESENT STATE OF MEDICAL LIBRARIES IN BIHAR AND THE WORKING
CONDITIONS OF THE PROFESSIONALS ENGAGED THERE. STRESSES THE NEED FOR
REORGANISATION OF THESE LIBRARIES WITH IMPROVED TECHNICAL SERVICES. SUGGESTS
THAT THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD USE THE FACILITIES PROVIDED BY THE WORLD HEALTH
ORGANISATION, THE NATIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY IN DELHI AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
OF MEDICINE IN WASHINGTON.
A STUDY TOUR OF ART LIBRARIES IN GERMANY DURING SEPTEMBER 1979. PART 1.
     
THE 1ST PART OF A 2-PART ARTICLE REPORTING THE AUTHOR'S VISIT TO WEST GERMAN
ART LIBRARIES (PART 2 IS TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE NEXT ISSUE). CONCENTRATES ON
THE KUNSTBIBLIOTHEK AND THE MUSEUMSBIBLIOTHEK DER STAATLICHEN MUSEEN
PREUSSISCHER KULTURBESITZ IN BERLIN, THE BIBLIOTHEK DES GERMANISCHEN
NATIONALMUSEUM, NUREMBERG, AND THE KUNST- UND MUSEUMSBIBLIOTHEK DER STADT
KOLN, COLOGNE. DESCRIBES THE SCOPE AND ORGANISATION OF THESE LIBRARIES AND
DISCUSSES GENERAL TOPICS SUCH AS THE EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATION BETWEEN MUSEUMS
AND INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION.
THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP. OCCASIONAL PUBLICATION SERIES NUMBER TEN.
     
DEVELOPED TO SHED LIGHT ON UK THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP, THIS STUDY DEFINES
THEATRE LIBRARIES, ILLUSTRATES THE KIND OF WORK CARRIED OUT IN THEATRE

LIBRARIANSHIP FOR LEGISLATURES.
THE FRENCH BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE FROM 1975 TO 1981.
     
A SURVEY OF THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE'S MAIN ACTIVITIES SINCE REORGANISATION
IN 1975 SHOWING PROGRESS TO DATE IN CARRYING OUT ITS NEW FUNCTIONS. COVERS
GENERAL REORGANISATION TO MEET NEW RESPONSIBILITIES; BUDGETING AND STAFF;
REALLOCATION AND RESTORATION OF BUILDINGS TO HOUSE INCREASED HOLDINGS, WITH
DETAILS OF PROVINCIAL VENTURES; ENRICHMENT OF COLLECTIONS, WITH DETAILS OF
RECENT DONATIONS AND PURCHASES; CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS; INDEXING
AND INFORMATION WORK IN RELATION TO CATALOGUES; GENERAL PUBLICITY AND
EXHIBITIONS, WITH DETAILS OF PUBLICATIONS AND TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT
DISPLAYS; RESEARCH WORK IN PROGRESS; AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES.
FINALLY DISCUSSES ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL OBSTACLES INHIBITING A FULLER
REALISATION OF THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE'S ROLE.
A GLANCE ACROSS THE RHINE' THE FRENCH CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES.
     
THE 76 FRENCH CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES, COMPARABLE WITH THE GERMAN STATE
LIBRARY CENTRES, ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND
COMMUNICATION. EACH LIBRARY CONTAINS A GARAGE FOR THE MOBILE LIBRARIES, BOOK
STORES, OFFICES AND MULTI-PURPOSE ROOMS FOR COMMITTEE MEETINGS, CONFERENCES
AND STAFF TRAINING SESSIONS. LARGE BOOK STOCKS AVERAGING 300,000 VOLUMES LEAD
TO SPACE SHORTAGES. STAFF INCLUDE BOTH STATE EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS. HELP
FOR CULTURALLY UNDERPRIVILEGED AREAS IS PROVIDED BY' DIRECT LOAN TO THE PUBLIC
FROM MOBILE LIBRARIES; DEPOSIT LOAN IN FACTORIES, SCHOOLS, YOUTH CLUBS,
HOLIDAY RESORTS AND OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES; ORGANISATION OF BOOK-ORIENTED
ACTIVITIES. THE CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES' WORK REFLECTS THE CURRENT TENDENCY
TOWARD DECENTRALISATION.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE' HISTORICALLY ORIENTED THEORIES
AND HYPOTHESES OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
IDENTIFIES THOSE WRITINGS IN THE AREA OF LIBRARY HISTORY WHICH HAVE ATTEMPTED
TO STATE THEORETICALLY ORIENTED GENERALISATIONS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES; ASSESSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE THEORIES CONFORM TO THE
TYPES OF THEORIES USED IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES; AND DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO
WHICH THESE THEORIES OR GENERALISATIONS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL
RESEARCH. THE CENTRAL GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS IS ON THE US PUBLIC LIBRARY, BUT
ATTENTION IS ALSO PAID TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN WESTERN
EUROPE.
THE PEOPLE WANT PAP, OR IDEAS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF LIBRARY WORK.
     
A YOUNG LIBRARIAN CHALLENGES HIS COLLEAGUES TO QUESTION THE ATTITUDE THAT THEY
HAVE HELD TOWARDS THEIR WORK UNTIL NOW. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE AT PRESENT IN A
BLIND ALLEY. LIBRARIANS HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT BOOKS ARE NOT SIMPLY THE SOURCES
OF CERTAIN IDEAS' THEY ARE ALSO GOODS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF MARKETING, HENCE
THE PREDOMINANCE OF BEST-SELLERS AND TRIVIAL MATERIAL ON THE MARKET. IT IS
WRONG TO VALUE THE ABILITY TO READ ABOVE THAT OF PLAYING FOOTBALL; WHAT IS
VITAL IS DISCRIMINATION AND SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF THE
MATERIAL READ. LIBRARIANS ARE AFTER ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR ACTUAL AND
POTENTIAL READERS, BY WHOM THEIR WORK IS FINANCED.
ALL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE FOR ALL.
     
ARGUES THAT DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE NO LONGER FOLLOW THE DEMOCRATIC
TRADITION OF ANGLO-SAXON LIBRARIES, NOR DO THEY RESPOND TO THE NEW SIGNALS
COMING FROM THE UK AND THE USA, WHERE THE SOCIAL IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES AND
THE NEED FOR COORDINATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES ARE STRESSED AND WHERE IT IS
FELT THAT LIBRARIES AS ARSENALS OF KNOWLEDGE HAVE THE SOLUTION TO MAN'S GLOBAL
PROBLEMS. IN SWEDEN TOO THERE IS A TENDENCY TOWARDS A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM.
INSISTS THAT ALL LIBRARY TYPES SHOULD BE DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED UNDER 1
MINISTRY; THE SEPARATIST ATTITUDE OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS THEREFORE
REGRETTABLE. LIBRARIES SHOULD DEFINE THEIR USERS MORE BROADLY, NOW THAT THE
EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE POPULATION HAS RISEN AND USERS NEED MATERIAL AT ALL
LEVELS. ECONOMIC CUTS NECESSITATE A UNIFIED SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES.
USE OF THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN LIBRARIES IS A QUESTION OF THE
SURVIVAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC LIBRARY, IT CAN REVOLUTIONISE RURAL LIFE AN D
EDUCATION. IT IS SOCIETY THROUGH ITS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH MUST DECIDE
WHETHER INFORMATION IS TO BE A PUBLIC, DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED, OR A PRIVATE
CONCERN.
ALBANIA-A JOURNEY INTO THE PAST AND FUTURE.
     
DESCRIBES LIBRARY CONDITIONS IN ALBANIA. THE COUNTRY HAS A POLICY OF
SELF-SUFFICIENCY, WHICH CAN MAKE IT SEEM ISOLATED POLITICALLY AND
ECONOMICALLY. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
AND 26 CENTRAL, DISTRICT, LIBRARIES. THE LATTER COORDINATE LOCAL LIBRARY
ACTIVITIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN TIRANA, WITH 800,000 VOLUMES, HAS, LIKE
OTHER PUBLIC LIBRARIES, MAINLY TECHNICAL, SCIENTIFIC, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
WORKS, AND RECEIVES 15 COPIES OF EACH BOOK PUBLISHED IN ALBANIA. IT RUNS A
2-YEAR COURSE IN LIBRARIANSHIP. DESCRIBES VISITS TO LIBRARIES IN TIRANA AND
FIER AND TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN TIRANA, FOUNDED IN 1957, WITH 550,000
VOLUMES. CULTURAL ACTIVITIES ARE GIVEN HIGH PRIORITY, BUT TAKE PLACE OUTSIDE
LIBRARIES IN CULTURAL CENTRES.
FROM THE WORK OF THE HENTEL AIMAK LIBRARY.
     
THE STOCK OF THE HENTEL AIMAK LIBRARY IN MONGOLIA HAS GROWN FROM 200 VOLUMES
IN 1944 TO 50,000 VOLUMES TODAY. ACQUISITIONS ARE BASED ON AN ANNUAL
THEMATICAL PLAN, THE HIGHEST % BEING SOCIO-POLITICAL LITERATURE (26,3%)
FOLLOWED BY CHILDREN'S BOOKS (25,7%) AND BOOKS ON ARTS (24,7%). CIRCULATION
AND BOOK PROCESSING METHODS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. 1 OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE
LIBRARY IS THE PROVISION OF METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO SMALLER LIBRARIES IN
ITS AREA INCLUDING TOWN, VILLAGE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THIS IS DONE THROUGH
LIBRARY SEMINARS AND THE PUBLICATION OF METHODOLOGICAL MATERIALS. PRACTICAL
HELP IS PROVIDED BY LIBRARIANS-METHODOLOGISTS WHO TRAVEL TO THE SMALLER
LIBRARIES ON REGULAR VISITS.
LIBRARY SERVICES IN INDONESIA.
     
AS PART OF A PROGRAMME OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA
HAS LAID GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE PROVISION OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES FOR ALL
SECTORS OF THE POPULATION. AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS PROGRAMME THE
GOVERNMENT HAS DRAWN UP PLANS FOR THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL NETWORK OF
LIBRARY SERVICES TO PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND TO PROVIDE
INFORMATION FOR THE CULTURAL AND RECREATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.
IN 1974 THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE CREATED THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR
LIBRARY SERVICES TO SUPERVISE THE CARRYING OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME. IN THE LAST
5 YEARS A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES HAS BEEN SET UP THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY,
INCLUDING 19 REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES AND A NEW NATIONAL LIBRARY, AND 2,000
STAFF HAVE RECEIVED LIBRARY TRAINING.
TANZANIA AND ITS PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
SINCE TANZANIA BECAME INDEPENDENT IN 1961 THE LIBRARY SYSTEM HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. IN 1963 THE LIBRARY
SERVICES BOARD ACT WAS PASSED WHICH LED TO THE NATIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARY IN DAR
ES SALAAM BEING BUILT IN 1967. THE LIBRARY STARTED WITH A STOCK OF 136,000 AND
IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE TANZANIA LIBRARY SERVICES. FROM THIS CENTRE OTHER
LIBRARIES WERE PLANNED, FIRSTLY IN THE DISTRICT TOWNS, THEN ON A SMALLER SCALE
IN RURAL AREAS. CONVERTED LORRIES SERVED AS MOBILE LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS AT
FIRST. THE TOTAL STOCK OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES STILL ONLY TOTALS 900,000 FOR A
POPULATION OF 17,000,000. A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS FOUNDED IN DAR ES SALAAM IN
1961. AT PRESENT COMPLETE TRAINING FACILITIES FOR LIBRARY STAFF ARE NOT
AVAILABLE AND LIBRARY STUDENTS HAVE TO SPEND SOME TIME STUDYING ABROAD. A
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXISTS' TANZANIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND PUBLISHES A
JOURNAL CALLED 2MAKTABA1.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY MISSION STATEMENT AND ITS IMPERATIVES FOR SERVICE.
     
WORK PREPARED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION GOALS, GUIDELINES, AND
STANDARDS COMMITTEE. INTERIM STATEMENT, PRODUCED AS A BRIDGE TO THE NEW AND
LONG-DESIRED APPROACH TO LIBRARY STANDARDS. PRESENTS A STATEMENT ON THE
PRESENT US PUBLIC LIBRARY SITUATION, DETAILS OF NEEDED RESPONSES TO SOCIAL
CHANGE AND IMPERATIVES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
PROFILE OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
THE 5-YEARLY 2CENSUS OF LIBRARIES1, PUBLISHED BY THE NEW ZEALAND DEPARTMENT OF
STATISTICS, PROVIDES SO MUCH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON THE COUNTRY'S
LIBRARIES THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DIGEST AND INTERPRET. USING THE
1974 ISSUE (THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED), SETS OUT A METHOD OF PRODUCING A
PROFILE (IN THE FORMAT OF A GRAPH) OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY, BASED ON 5 FACTORS
(POPULATION SERVED, TOTAL BOOK-STOCK, CIRCULATION, NUMBER OF FULL-TIME STAFF,
AND OPERATING EXPENDITURE). THIS PROFILE ENABLES COMPARISONS TO BE MADE OF THE
RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF SIMILAR LIBRARIES.
IF CONFIDENCE VANISHES IN THE FUTURE' STATE LIBRARY CENTRE, WHITHER GOEST
THOU?.
     
MOST STATE LIBRARY CENTRES, EXCEPT THOSE IN BAVARIA, NOW HAVE TO FACE
FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, JUST AT A TIME WHEN INCREASES IN STOCKS AND SERVICES
ARE BADLY NEEDED. EVERYTHING THAT LIBRARY CENTRES HOPED FOR SEEMS THREATENED.
THE GERMAN TENDENCY TOWARDS PERFECTION APPLIES TO MEDIUM-SIZED RATHER THAN TO
SMALL ORGANISATIONS. THE INCREASED USE OF NON-BOOK MEDIA HAS CHANGED THE
CENTRES' ROLE. THE CENTRES HAVE PLAYED AN INVALUABLE PART IN DEVELOPING RURAL
LIBRARY SERVICES BUT THEIR GOLDEN AGE IS NOW PAST. LIBRARY POLICY COULD BE
ALTERED, HOWEVER, THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CENTRES' TASKS BY REGIONAL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE FORMED IN AREAS WHERE NONE
EXIST; BASED ON A CONSTITUTION WORKED OUT BY LOCAL POLITICIANS, THEY CAN WORK
TOWARDS IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY.
AVOIDING THE WORST' THE 29TH CONFERENCE OF THE STATE LIBRARY CENTRES IN
BURGHAUSEN.
     
REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE HELD IN SEPT/OCT 81, WITH A CENTRAL THEME OF
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS. SUBJECTS COVERED INCLUDED' THE
FORESEEABLE AND UNFORESEEABLE ASPECTS OF LIBRARY PLANNING; THE TASKS AND
FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SPATIAL PLANNING; AND
LITERATURE PROVISION WITHIN RURAL CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. WARNINGS WERE GIVEN
AGAINST EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS PROVIDED WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND
AGAINST RESIGNATION IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES. A BROADLY BASED,
DECENTRALISED LENDING SYSTEM SHOULD CATER FOR BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED
REQUIREMENTS. THE STATE SHOULD SUPPORT AND COMPLEMENT LOCAL LIBRARY SERVICES
BUT REFRAIN FROM EXCESSIVE INTERFERENCE IN THEM. BAVARIA IS THE STATE THAT HAS
MADE MOST PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION; ITS STATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME REFLECTS
THE IMPORTANCE OF SYSTEMATIC PLANNING.
BLACKPOOL LIBRARIES 1880-1980.
     
A BRIEF HISTORY TO COMMEMORATE 100 YEARS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BLACKPOOL, UK.
DESCRIBES EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE OPENING OF THE 1ST LIBRARY 18 JUNE 1880
WITH A STOCK OF 1,000. THE LIBRARY MOVED TO LARGER PREMISES IN ST. JOHN'S
MARKET BUILDINGS IN 1895 AND YET AGAIN INTO A NEW BUILDING FUNDED BY CARNEGIE
IN 1911. TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRANCH LIBRARIES AND REORGANISATION OF THE
SYSTEM AFTER WORLD WAR II. CONCLUDES WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE SITUATION SINCE
LANCASHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL TOOK OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR BLACKPOOL'S LIBRARY
SERVICE IN 1974.
IT'S A SQUASH IN NAESTVED.
     
REPORT ON NAESTVED PUBLIC LIBRARY, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS WITH USERS AND THE
LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARY IS CENTRALLY PLACED, HAS A TOTAL OF 1614 SQ.M. ON 3
FLOORS AND EMPLOYS 36 STAFF. WITH A POPULATION OF 45,000, NAESTVED NOW NEEDS A
MAIN LIBRARY OF 4000 SQ.M. IN ADDITION TO THE PLANNED BRANCH LIBRARY SERVING
THE TOWN'S EAST END. INTERVIEWS USERS OF THE NEWSPAPER READING ROOM, THE
GENERAL LENDING SECTION, THE MUSIC LIBRARY, WHICH LENDS RECORDS AND TAPES, AND
THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY; MOST OF THESE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES. CUTS
HAVE NOT AFFECTED ACQUISITIONS AS MUCH AS FEARED, BUT SERVICES SUCH AS THE
HOME LOAN SERVICE TO THE ELDERLY AND THE MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES ARE
OVERSTRETCHED, AND SPACE FOR MEETINGS AND ARRANGEMENTS IS INADEQUATE. FILMS
ARE SHOWN IN THE LOCAL CINEMA.
A GLANCE AT ALMA PUBLIC LIBRARY, QUEBEC.
     
AN ACCOUNT OF HOW SERVICES AT ALMA PUBLIC LIBRARY, QUEBEC WERE EXPANDED ON
RELOCATION IN MORE SPACIOUS QUARTERS, WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF SEVERE BUDGET
RESTRICTIONS. PRIORITIES WERE IMPROVEMENT OF THE REFERENCE SERVICE, CREATION
OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS, CATALOGUING NEW AND EXISTING STOCK, INTRODUCTION OF
READER SERVICES, COLLABORATION WITH SCHOOLS, AND ORGANISATION OF EXHIBITIONS.
FUTURE PROJECTS ARE OUTLINED.
THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSITY AT KAISERSLAUTERN.
     
KAISERSLAUTERN IS A SMALL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY WITH 3,500 STUDENTS AT PRESENT.
THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS AN INTEGRATED LIBRARY WITH A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND 5
DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES. AT PRESENT THERE IS NO 1 BUILDING FOR THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY WHICH IS SPREAD OVER 4 SITES, BUT A NEW BUILDING IS PLANNED FOR 1983.
THE LIBRARY HAS HAD INSUFFICIENT STAFF FROM THE START AND THIS PROBLEM REMAINS
UNSOLVED. THE LIBRARY IS BY NO MEANS A UNIVERSAL LIBRARY; ITS COLLECTION
COVERS ALL THE SUBJECTS OFFERED BY THE UNIVERSITY WHICH ARE TECHNICAL AND
SCIENTIFIC. THE STOCK AMOUNTS TO OVER 350,000 VOLUMES AND IS ANNUALLY
INCREASED BY A FURTHER 50,000.
TWO-YEAR COLLEGE LIBRARIES' A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF ACRL 2STANDARDS.
     
THE ANALYSIS OF 1977 HIGHER EDUCATION GENERAL INFORMATION SURVEYS (HEGIS) DATA
FOR 2-YEAR COLLEGE LIBRARIES IN TERMS OF THE 1979 ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES (ACRL) 2STANDARDS 1SHOWS THAT A MAJORITY DO NOT MEET THE
STANDARDS IN RESPECT TO NEARLY ALL THE VARIABLES AVAILABLE FOR STUDY. HEGIS
DATA DO NOT INCLUDE MEASURES OF SOME IMPORTANT FACTORS SUCH AS SPACE AND
EQUIPMENT, AND NOT ALL DATA ARE GATHERED IN TERMS THAT MATCH THE 2STANDARDS'
1DEFINITIONS. INCREASED FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO BRING THE LIBRARIES OF
THE USA'S 2-YEAR SCHOOLS UP TO STANDARD.
SLAVIC ETHNIC LIBRARIES, MUSEUMS AND ARCHIVES IN THE UNITED STATES' A GUIDE
AND DIRECTORY.

THE VATICAN LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE VATICAN LIBRARY. DESPITE NUMEROUS PLUNDERS AND DISPERSALS OF THE
COLLECTIONS THE LIBRARY HAS GROWN UNDER THE CARE OF MANY LIBRARY CARDINALS AND
POPES. THUS ON THE DEATH OF POPE NICHOLAS V IN 1455 IT CONTAINED EUROPE'S
LARGEST MANUSCRIPT COLLECTION. THE OFFICIAL FOUNDATION WAS LAID WITH SIXTUS
IV'S BULL IN 1475, THE COLLECTION WAS ORGANISED IN 4 PARTS, AND THE 1ST
CATALOGUE APPEARED IN 1485. A LIBERAL LENDING POLICY WAS STOPPED FOR ALL TIME
BY SIXTUS V, WHO ALSO HAD THE PRESENT BUILDING ERECTED IN 1588. EXPANSION
FORCED THE LIBRARY TO OCCUPY ROOMS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL SISTINE SALOON. THE
20TH CENTURY HAS SEEN MODERNISATION OF THE BUILDING AND OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. THE LIBRARY CONTAINS AMONG MANY PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS THE
COLLECTION BELONGING TO QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN. CATALOGUING OF MANUSCRIPTS,
INCUNABULA AND PRINTED BOOKS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE 15TH CENTURY.
THE VATICAN LIBRARY FROM LEO XIII TO JOHN PAUL II.
     
FROM 1879, UNDER THE PONTIFICATE OF LEO XIII, THE DOORS OF THE VATICAN LIBRARY
AND ARCHIVES WERE OPENED WIDER UNTIL, BY 1885, BOTH INSTITUTIONS WELCOMED ALL
WHO REPRESENTED THE WORLD OF LEARNING IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE, CREED OR CLASS.
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INSTITUTIONS TO THE PRESENT DAY, MENTIONING
THE MAJOR FIGURES AND THE ROLE OF THE US, PARTICULARLY THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS. TODAY THE LIBRARY CONTAINS 60,000 CODICES AND 700,000 PRINTED BOOKS
OF WHICH OVER 7,000 ARE INCUNABULA, ALSO 100,000 MAPS AND ENGRAVINGS. THE
ARCHIVES ARE MAINLY THE PAPAL WORKING FILES OF OTHER DAYS. BOTH HAVE SEPARATE
PHOTOGRAPHIC UNITS.
THE SMALL CHURCH LIBRARY' A GUIDE TO ORGANISING AND MANAGING IT.
     
DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A CHURCH LIBRARY UNDER
THE FOLLOWING HEADINGS' SIZE AND LOCATION; DECIDING ON A CLASSIFICATION
SCHEME; EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES; PREPARING BOOKS FOR THE SHELVES; TYPING AND
FILING CATALOGUE CARDS; SETTING UP THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM; MAKING SIGNS AND
SHELF LABELS; MAGAZINES AND OTHER MATERIALS; PUTTING THE LIBRARY INTO
OPERATION, SELECTING BOOKS, AND PROMOTING USE.
RESEARCH LIBRARIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF VIENNA.
     
UNLIKE MANY OTHER GERMAN SPEAKING DIOCESES, VIENNA HAS NO DIOCESAN LIBRARY AS
SUCH BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES ATTACHED TO VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS
BESIDES THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ADMINISTERED BY THE CHURCH. BRIEF HISTORIES ARE
GIVEN OF THE 9 EXISTING ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF THE DIOCESE. THE SEMINARY
LIBRARY IS THE LARGEST, WITH 65,000 VOLUMES AND THE ARCHDIOCESAN LIBRARY IS
THE OLDEST, FOUNDED IN 15TH CENTURY, AND HOUSING 30,000 VOLUMES. OTHER
LIBRARIES ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND QUITE SMALL. MORE COORDINATION BETWEEN THEM
WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AS WELL AS GREATER COOPERATION WITH THE PUBLIC
SECTOR.
RECONSTRUCTION PLAN OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY AT GERLE.
     
DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY AT THE NYIREGYHAZA COUNTY HOSPITAL HAS BEEN
PLANNED TO BECOME AN INFORMATION SUPPLY BASIS AND SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOP OF THE
PARENT ESTABLISHMENT. THE PRESENT POOR CONDITIONS ARE CHARACTERISED BY A
40-SQ.M READING ROOM, THE FREE-SHELF STORAGE ROOM IS AT THE SAME TIME A STUDY
ROOM. THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL READERS IS 250 PHYSICIANS, 1,200 NURSES AND
OTHER PROFESSIONALS. DEVELOPMENT PLANS RELATE TO A BETTER COVERAGE OF
HOLDINGS; SUBJECT CATALOGUE; INTRODUCTION OF SDI; AND BROADER INTERLIBRARY
LOANS.

WE SHALL NEED TO PESTER THE POLITICIANS.
     
SUMMARISES THE TALKS ON VARIOUS FORMS OF HANDICAP GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON THE
READING HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES ARRANGED BY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
J. PETERSEN: 'THE READING HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES IN THE FUTURE': HIGHER
PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO MATERIALS FOR THIS GROUP. S. HOLST: 'SERVICES TO
THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED': THIS IS THE MOST NEGLECTED GROUP; THE POLICY OF
COMMUNITY CARE NOW POSES AN INCREASING CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. S.
JENSEN: 'THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED': THESE ARE MAINLY THE ELDERLY. G.S.
NIELSEN: 'THE MOBILITY HANDICAPPED': THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY UNABLE TO READ,
BUT THEY DEPEND LARGELY ON DOMESTIC LENDING SERVICES AND SERVICES LIKE SPOKEN
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS. L. AAGAARD: 'THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING'. J.O. RIIS: 'THE
APHASICS': THESE OFTEN HAVE DEFECTIVE VISION, SO THAT READING MATERIAL MUST BE
CLEAR AND SIMPLE. J. KYNDBORG: 'DYSLEXICS'. B. PORS: 'TECHNICAL AIDS':
DESCRIBES AN EXHIBITION. A DANISH I NSTITUTE OF TECHNICAL AIDS HAS NOW BEEN
ESTABLISHED.
THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PUBLIC LIBRARIES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO HANDICAPPED
PEOPLE IN THE USA. CHANGES IN THE LAWS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE MAKING OF ALL
PUBLIC BUILDINGS ACCESSIBLE TO THE HANDICAPPED. THIS HAS LED TO NEW STANDARDS
FOR BUILDING AND THE RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS SOME OF WHICH HAVE REQUIRED
CONSIDERABLE WORK. THE NEW LAWS HAVE CAUSED CONTROVERSY IN SMALL TOWNS WITH
FEW, IF ANY, HANDICAPPED PEOPLE OVER WHO SHOULD PAY FOR RENOVATION WORK.
CONCLUDES THAT CLEARER GUIDELINES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO MAKE THE LAW MORE
FLEXIBLE AND TO GUARANTEE THAT SMALL TOWN BUILDINGS SUCH AS LIBRARIES ARE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD
ALSO CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING FOR ACCESSIBILITY RENOVATIONS.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE BLIND AND PRINT HANDICAPPED AND THE UNITED NATIONS

SERVING 900 USERS, ATTACHED TO A MONTREAL INSTITUTE FOR THE VISUALLY
HANDICAPPED. DESCRIBES THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY FROM ITS
FOUNDATION IN 1861, AND GIVES DETAILS OF CURRENT HOLDINGS OF BOTH BRAILLE AND
TALKING BOOKS. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE STAFF AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS IN COLLECTION
MANAGEMENT ARE DESCRIBED, AND THE OPERATION OF THE POSTAL LOAN SYSTEM
OUTLINED. PROCEDURES FOR SELECTING MATERIAL ARE DISCUSSED, AND THE ADVANTAGES
OF TALKING BOOKS OVER BRAILLE DEBATED.
AMERICAN LIBRARIES FOR THE BLIND ARE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT CUTS.
     
DESCRIBES, WITH FIGURES, THE PRESENT LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE BLIND IN THE
USA. THE SERVICES ARE COORDINATED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE
BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED UNDER THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (NLS). NLS
PRODUCES CATALOGUES, PR MATERIAL, AND A MANUAL, AND PROVIDES CONSULTANTS. IT
UNDERTAKES ALL SELECTION OF MATERIAL TO BE TRANSFERRED TO BRAILLE PRINT,
FLEXIBLE DISCS OR, MOSTLY, TO 4 TRACK CASSETTE TAPES. THESE ARE ISSUED MAINLY
BY POST THROUGH THE 56 REGIONAL LIBRARIES AND THEIR 102 BRANCHES. SOME
REGIONAL LIBRARIES ALSO ORGANISE RECORDINGS OF LOCAL MATERIAL BY VOLUNTEERS,
BUT THE ONE IN NEW YORK HAS HAD TO CURTAIL ITS SERVICES. 4 MULTI-STATE CENTRES
ACT AS SERVICE CENTRES FOR THE REGIONAL LIBRARIES. PRIVATE LIBRARY SERVICES TO
THE BLIND INCLUDE' RECORDINGS FOR THE BLIND, THE JEWISH GUILD FOR THE BLIND'S
CASSETTE LIBRARY, AND THE RADIO READING SERVICE; ALL USE VOLUNTEER READERS AND
PROVIDE SERVICES FREE.
ADAPTING AND ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL GOALS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE AUSTINE SCHOOL.
     
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND MEDIA CENTRES VARY WIDELY IN SIZE, QUALITY OF SERVICE,
ATMOSPHERE, AND CONTENTS OF COLLECTIONS. THIS DISPARITY IS DUE TO DIFFERENCES
IN BUDGETS, EDUCATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, ARCHITECTURE, CURRICULA,
AND GEOGRAPHY AND POPULATION OF THE SCHOOLS. AUSTINE SCHOOL AFFORDS A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE THOSE FACTORS WHICH MAKE ONE SITUATION UNIQUE, BY
REASON OF ITS SPECIALISED NEEDS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES OF SPACE, MONEY,
PERSONNEL AND MATERIALS. ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS IN
SUITING A SCHOOL LIBRARY'S OPERATION TO THE AIMS OF DEAF EDUCATION, TO
ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS IS DONE AT THE AUSTINE SCHOOL FOR HEARING HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN, AND TO DRAW GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW A SCHOOL'S LIBRARY CAN BE
SURE OF SATISFYING SPECIALISED NEEDS IN HARMONY WITH ITS ACADEMIC PROGRAMME.
QUEBEC DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
A REPORT OF A SURVEY OF 35 QUEBEC PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY QUESTIONNAIRE, TO WHICH
15 RESPONDED. POINTS COVERED INCLUDE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION WITH VOLUNTARY
ASSISTANCE, SERVICES OFFERED, AND PROJECTS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION.
WHO'S AFRAID OF THE REBELLIOUS YOUNGSTERS OF TODAY?: OR, LIBRARIANS WERE ALSO
YOUNG ONCE.
     
IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OF
HOOLIGANISM IN LIBRARIES CAUSED BY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE NETHERLANDS. A NUMBER
OF CONFERENCES HAVE BEEN HELD ON THE SUBJECT AND IN SEVERAL AREAS WORKING
PARTIES HAVE BEEN FORMED TO STUDY THE PROBLEM. THROUGHOUT THE NETHERLANDS THE
NUMBER OF REGISTERED LIBRARY USERS BELOW THE AGE OF 18 HAS INCREASED BY 93%
FOLLOWING THE ABOLITION OF MEMBERSHIP CHARGES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE REPRESENT THE NEXT GENERATION OF ADULT
READERS AND SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO MAKE USE OF LIBRARIES BY
PROVIDING SPECIAL ROOMS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE MAY LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MEET THEIR
FRIENDS.
POPULAR CULTURE AS A TEACHING TOOL IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA CENTER.
     
AN EXAMINATION OF THE PLACE OF POPULAR CULTURE IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
CENTRE AND THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALIST IN INTEGRATING IT INTO THE

SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON.) ASSESSES THE ATTITUDES OF
SECONDARY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TOWARDS LIBRARIANS' PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES, THE
CAPABILITY OR APTITUDE OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR FULFILLING THE ROLE, AND THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE. ALSO ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE
LIBRARIANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ADMINISTRATORS' ATTITUDES, AS WELL AS MAKE
SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGE TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICE AND TO MAKE THE LIBRARIAN
MORE EFFECTIVE. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 53 SECONDARY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN
WISCONSIN PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND 49 LIBRARIANS IN THE SAME SCHOOLS.
LIBRARY SERVICES IN DISTANCE TEACHING' PRESENT REALITIES AND FUTURE
POSSIBILITIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS OF PROVIDING LIBRARY SERVICES IN DISTANCE TEACHING,
WITH REFERENCE TO THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF THE LIBRARY PROVISION FOR
EXTERNAL STUDENTS OFFERED BY 36 AUSTRALIAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. SUGGESTS
SOME WAYS OF IMPROVING THESE SERVICES, AND DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT IN THE USE
OF MICROFICHE BY EXTERNAL STUDENTS CARRIED OUT BY THE TOWNSVILLE COLLEGE OF
ADVANCED EDUCATION. HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH ON THE
SUBJECT OF PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES IN DISTANCE EDUCATION.
THE PRODUCTION STIMULATING FACTORY LIBRARY IN WEST GERMANY.
     
DESPITE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY, PRIVATE WORKPLACE
LIBRARIES REMAIN IMPORTANT. THERE ARE 250 OF THESE WITH 1 1/2 MILLION VOLUMES
SERVING 800,000 EMPLOYEES. AN INVESTIGATION IN 1974 BY KONJETZKY AND PLOETZ
REVEALED AN ILLIBERAL BIAS IN BOOK SELECTION. THE FACTORY LIBRARIANS'
ORGANISATION JUSTIFIES THE LIBRARY BY ITS USEFULNESS TO THE FIRM AND REFERS TO
AN ARTICLE BY MUTH (THE READER AS A FACTOR OF PRODUCTIVITY IN THE FIRM), IN
WHICH HE ARGUES THAT THE AIM OF THE LIBRARY IS TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN THE
ABILITY TO READ, AS EFFICIENT READERS MEAN WORKERS WITH HIGH MOBILITY, AND
MONEY SPENT ON LIBRARIES IS LIKELY TO YIELD A HIGH RETURN.
WORKERS' LIBRARIES IN THE POTSDAM DISTRICT 1900-1933.
     
THE HISTORY OF THE WORKERS' LIBRARIES IN GERMANY FALLS INTO 3 PERIODS. THE 1ST
LIBRARIES CAME INTO EXISTENCE BETWEEN 1836-1889. FROM 1890-1914/18 RAPID
DEVELOPMENT TOOK PLACE. 1918-1933 THE LIBRARIES BEGAN TO DECLINE, WERE
INTEGRATED WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND MANY DESTROYED IN THE LITERARY PURGE OF
1933. THE LIBRARIES IN THE POTSDAM DISTRICT DATED FROM THE 2ND PERIOD AND WERE
ALL DESTROYED IN 1933. THE 1ST WORKERS' LIBRARY WAS IN RATHENOW AND GREW FROM
210 BOOKS IN 1899 TO A STOCK OF 6,000 IN THE 1920S. THE CENTRAL WORKERS'
LIBRARY IN BRANDENBURG EXISTED FROM 1902-1933.
WHEN THE READERS DON'T COME' AN ATTEMPT AT INTEGRATING THE LIBRARY INTO AN
AREA OF URBAN RENEWAL.
     
THE ST. PAULI DISTRICT OF HAMBURG IS A SOCIALLY UNDERPRIVILEGED AREA WHERE
SLUM CLEARANCE IS TAKING PLACE. IN 1980, LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 20,000
VOLUMES OF WHICH 800 ARE TURKISH LITERATURE PROVIDED FOR THE MANY FOREIGN
RESIDENTS; THERE ARE ALSO GAMES AND GERMAN AND TURKISH CASSETTES. THE BOOK
TURNOVER IS BELOW THE AVERAGE FOR HAMBURG LIBRARIES. SINCE MANY ADULT
RESIDENTS EITHER UNDERSTOOD LITTLE GERMAN OR ARE CONFUSED BY THE LIBRARY'S
TECHNICAL PROCEDURES, FEW OF THEM USE THE LIBRARY. LOCAL CHILDREN TEND TO USE
THE LIBRARY AS A MEETING-PLACE, WHICH CAUSES NOISE BUT DOES PROVIDE SOMEWHERE
TO PLAY. THE LIBRARIAN, MOVING AWAY FROM PURELY TRADITIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP,
WORKS CLOSELY WITH LOCAL SOCIAL WORKERS, VISITING FAMILIES TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS
AND ALLOWING THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY FOR MEETINGS; THIS HELPS TO INTEGRATE THE
LIBRARY INTO THE COMMUNITY.
A VISIT TO BRENT PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
A GERMAN LIBRARIAN RECORDS HER IMPRESSIONS OF THIS LONDON BOROUGH'S LIBRARY
WORK WITH FOREIGN MINORITY GROUPS, INCLUDING WEST INDIANS, AFRICANS, INDIANS
AND PEOPLE OF MIXED RACE. SINCE 5 DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN IN
BRENT, ALL LIBRARY NOTICES ARE PUBLISHED IN THEM AS WELL AS IN ENGLISH. THE
TRADITIONAL FORM OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY, COMPRISING A CENTRAL LIBRARY WITH
BRANCHES CLOSELY DEPENDENT UPON IT, SEEMED NO LONGER SUITABLE FOR THIS
COMMUNITY. A LARGE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY WAS THEREFORE GIVEN TO EACH BRANCH
LIBRARY, HELPING IT TO CATER BETTER FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF ITS DISTRICT.
BOOKS ARE LENT TO YOUTH AND SPORTS CLUBS AND ACTIVITIES ORGANISED FOR
DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS. INTENSIVE TRAINING IS PROVIDED FOR LIBRARY STAFF ON
THE HISTORY, CULTURE AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF THE AFRICAN, ASIAN AND
CARIBBEAN RACES.
LIBRARIANS AND THEIR WORK AMONG READERS.
     
THERE ARE 346 PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE TURGOVISHCHE REGION. (NORTH-EAST
BULGARIA) WITH COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN 1 1/2 MILLION VOLUMES, I.E. ABOUT 9
BOOKS PER HEAD OF THE POPULATION. EACH READER BORROWS, ON AVERAGE, ALMOST 13
BOOKS EVERY YEAR. 1/3 OF THE 171,000 INHABITANTS IN THE AREA ARE TURKS CATERED
FOR BY 47 LIBRARIANS. AFTER LITERACY COURSES AND READING ALOUD IN THE EARLY
POST-WAR YEARS, THE LIBRARIANS' EFFORTS CAN NOW BE GEARED TO ATTRACTING
READERS FROM EVERY FAMILY. LIBRARIES ARE HELPED BY CLUBS OF YOUNG FRIENDS OF
BOOKS AS WELL AS BY OTHER ORGANISATIONS. DISCUSSIONS ON SIGNIFICANT WORKS OF
LITERATURE AND OTHER EVENTS ARE ARRANGED BY THE LIBRARIES TO ENCOURAGE THE
TURKISH POPULATION TO ATTAIN A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING AND TO TAKE PRIDE IN
THEIR SOCIALIST HOMELAND. RESULTS OF THE CONCERTED EFFORTS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED
MOST TANGIBLY IN THE CHANGED LIFE OF TURKISH WOMEN. VEILED IN THE RECENT PAST,
THEY WORK NOW, NOT ONLY IN AGRICULTURE, BU T IN MANY OTHER FIELDS. THEY ALSO
SING IN MIXED CHOIRS AND APPEAR ON THE STAGE. HOWEVER, AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
BULGARIAN LANGUAGE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD AMONG THE TURKS IN BULGARIA, THE
READING OF BOOKS IN TURKISH HAS FOLLOWED A PROGRESSIVE DOWNWARD TREND.
LIBRARY NEEDS OF CHILDREN ATTENDING SELF-HELP MOTHER-TONGUE SCHOOLS IN LONDON.
     
124 LONDON MOTHER-TONGUE 'SATURDAY SCHOOLS' WITH 13,919 PUPILS WERE SENT
POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES; THEIR TEACHERS WERE INTERVIEWED; 200 CHILDREN WERE
QUESTIONED ON THEIR READING HABITS AND LIBRARY USE; AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
VISITED TO ASSESS THEIR SERVICES TO ETHNIC MINORITIES, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN.
124 CHILDREN READ IN THEIR MOTHER TONGUE; 121 HAD READ A BOOK IN THEIR MOTHER
TONGUE WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS; AND 170 USED PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PROBLEMS
INCLUDED LACK OF SUITABLE BOOKS, LANGUAGE EXPERTISE IN SOME LIBRARY
AUTHORITIES, AND SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY CONTACT. ALL CONCERNED WOULD BENEFIT
FROM MORE COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION.
LIBRARIES AND THE FRENCH-SPEAKING VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN CANADA.

LIBRARIES AND THE FRENCH SPEAKING VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN CANADA AND MAKES
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. STATISTICS SHOW THE EXTENT OF VISUAL HANDICAP
IN QUEBEC, THE EXISTING SUBSTITUTES FOR CONVENTIONAL READING MATERIALS ARE
BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND SERVICES IN THE U.K. AND U.S.A. ARE OUTLINED AS MODELS.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SPECIALISED MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN QUEBEC FROM THE
CANADIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND; THE NAZARETH AND LOUIS BRAILLE
INSTITUTE; AND THE QUEBEC TAPE LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND. THE READER SERVICES
OFFERED BY THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE CRITICISED AS INADEQUATE, AND THE RESULTS OF
A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF 60 USERS CONDUCTED IN MARCH 81 ARE PRESENTED AS
EVIDENCE OF THE EXTENT OF READERS' INTERESTS AND THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE
SERVICES AVAILABLE. PROPOSES ORGANISATION OF USER TRAINING PROGRAMMES,
ASSESSES THE ADVANTAGES AND INCONVENIENCES  OF ORDINARY LIBRARY SERVICES, AND
SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GENERAL.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR FOREIGN RESIDENTS.
     
FOREIGN WORKERS HAVE MADE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS WEST GERMAN
PROSPERITY BUT OUR SOCIETY IS ILL PREPARED FOR THE ACUTENESS OF THE PROBLEMS
FACING FOREIGN CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. THEIR EDUCATIONAL DEPRIVATION IS
GROUNDED ABOVE ALL IN THEIR INFERIOR SOCIAL POSITION. FOREIGN CHILDREN SHOULD
EXPERIENCE A SOCIALISATION PROCESS WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE INTEGRATED
INTO GERMAN SOCIETY AND RE-INTEGRATED INTO THE SOCIETY OF THEIR NATIVE LAND,
FOR WHICH THEY MUST GROW UP TO BE BOTH BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL. THE LIBRARY
SHOULD BE THE FOREIGN CITIZENS' CENTRE FOR INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND
CULTURE. BILATERAL LITERATURE PROVISION, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE. BILATERAL
LITERATURE PROVISION HELPS FOREIGN CITIZENS TO BECOME CODETERMINING, ACTIVE
AND CREATIVE WITHIN OUR PLURALISTIC CULTURE. GOOD LIBRARY SERVICES
COMPLEMENTING GOOD SCHOOLING ARE AN INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE.
WOMEN AND MEN AS READERS OF LITERATURE.
     
ILLUSTRATES WITH STATISTICAL DATA HOW GENDER PLAYS A PART IN THE SELECTION OF
READING MATERIAL. DEMONSTRATES THAT, IN ADDITION TO SIMILARITIES OF A LARGE
DEGREE, CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCES ARE PERCEPTIBLE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN
SELECTION OF READING MATERIAL.
A SURVEY OF NON-RESIDENT LENDING AND BORROWING ACTIVITY IN MASSACHUSETTS.
     
THIS SURVEY PRESENTING RAW DATA FOR THE PLANNING OF RESOURCE SHARING AND OTHER
COOPERATIVE LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN MASSACHUSETTS FOCUSES ON THE BORROWING AND
LENDING CHARACTERISTICS OF LIBRARIES WITH REGARD TO NONRESIDENT BORROWING
ACTIVITY. IT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE UP-TO-DATE ESTIMATES OF SUCH ACTIVITY,
FORMULATE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO FISCAL PROBLEMS, AND EXPAND ACCESS POTENTIAL
FOR LIBRARY USERS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE NEGLECTED RESOURCE' NON-USAGE OF LIBRARY-INFORMATION SERVICES IN INDUSTRY
AND COMMERCE.
     
A SMALL-SCALE EXPLORATORY STUDY OF SUB-OPTIMAL USAGE OF INDUSTRIAL AND
COMMERCIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES WAS CARRIED OUT BY ASLIB IN SUMMER
80. NON-USE, MISUSE, AND ABUSE WERE EXAMINED FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF UNIT
MANAGERS. MAJOR AIMS WERE TO ASSESS THE REALITY, NATURE, AND EXTENT OF ANY
NON-USAGE PROBLEM AND THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE POPULATION.
     
AMPLIFIES THE INFORMATION ON THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS
LEISURE TIME RESEARCH BY DESCRIBING A SURVEY OF MORE THAN 4,000 MEMBERS OF THE
DANISH POPULATION. USERS AS WELL AS NON-USERS WERE INTERVIEWED, INCLUDING
CHILDREN. THE REPORT IS SUBDIVIDED ACCORDING TO AGE; ADULTS, OLDER SCHOOL
CHILDREN, YOUNGER SCHOOL CHILDREN, AND PRESCHOOL CHILDREN, AND CONTAINS
SECTIONS DEALING WITH NON-USERS. HALF THE POPULATION USES THE LIBRARY, BUT THE
INCIDENCE DECREASES WITH AGE, AND THE HIGHER THE DENSITY OF POPULATION, THE
GREATER THE % OF LIBRARY USERS. THE MOST CONCLUSIVE FACTOR WAS THE PERSON'S
LENGTH OF EDUCATION. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
TURKISH CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS AS LIBRARY USERS.
     
LIBRARIANS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE VIEWS OF FOREIGN WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
ON LIBRARIES; MANY OF THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND LITTLE GERMAN. IN JULY 80 MUNICH
MUNICIPAL LIBRARY PRODUCED A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TURKISH CHILDREN, INCLUDING
QUESTIONS ON AGE, SEX, SCHOOLS AND TYPES OF CLASS, LENGTH OF TIME IN GERMANY,
ABILITY TO READ GERMAN, LIBRARY USE AND LIKES AND DISLIKES CONCERNING BOOKS,
CASSETTES AND LIBRARY FACILITIES. LANGUAGE PROBLEMS LED TO SOME
MISUNDERSTANDINGS; THE DESIGN OF FUTURE QUESTIONNAIRES MUST BE IMPROVED.
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE AVERAGE READER IS 10-13 YEARS OLD, MALE, IN A TURKISH
CLASS AT SCHOOL AND CAN READ SOME GERMAN BOOKS. HE CAME TO GERMANY WITHIN THE
LAST 4 YEARS, LEARNT ABOUT THE LIBRARY FROM FRIENDS, HAS A READER'S TICKET AND
VISITS THE LIBRARY AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.
ARMENIANS IN LONDON' A CASE-STUDY OF THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF A SMALL AND
SCATTERED COMMUNITY.

LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NEEDS; TO HIGHLIGHT ANY SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION
WITH PROVIDING LIBRARY SERVICES TO THEM; AND TO IDENTIFY ANY COMMON PROBLEMS
AND NEEDS THAT THE ARMENIANS MAY HAVE WITH OTHER SMALL, SCATTERED MINORITY
GROUPS.
FEAR OF TALKING' WHICH STUDENTS IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY ASK LIBRARIANS FOR
HELP?.
     
FOR MANY LIBRARY USERS, THE LIBRARIAN IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ANY SEARCH
STRATEGY. AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS
OF 1 COMMUNICATION VARIABLE, COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION (CA), THE FEAR OF
TALKING, ON THE USER'S DECISION TO SEARCH A LIBRARY INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH THE
LIBRARIAN'S ASSISTANCE. IT WAS FOUND THAT RESPONDENTS, REGARDLESS OF CA LEVEL,
BEHAVED SIMILARLY IN SEARCHING A LIBRARY WHEN MEASURED IN TERMS OF INITIAL
STEP, NUMBER OF STEPS, AND LENGTH OF SEARCH TIME. CA WAS ELIMINATED AS A
VARIABLE INFLUENCING THE INITIATION OF AN INTERACTION WITH A LIBRARIAN.
FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE ITS POSSIBLE EFFECTS ONCE THAT
INTERACTION HAS BEGUN.
EXTENDING SCHOOL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO A SCATTERED POPULATION.
     
PAPER DELIVERED TO THE IFLA CONFERENCE, MANILA, AUG 80. THE GEOGRAPHY OF PAPUA
NEW GUINEA, ITS DIVERSE CULTURES AND LANGUAGES AND AN UNEQUAL DEVELOPMENT OF
EDUCATION AND LITERACY HAVE ALL HINDERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONWIDE
LIBRARY SERVICE. SOLUTIONS MIGHT INCLUDE THE INCREASING OF EFFICIENCY OF THE
PRIMARY SCHOOLS, THE USE OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN ADULT LITERACY TRAINING, AND
THE USE OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE CENTRE.
PROMOTING RECREATIONAL READING.
     
PRESENTS A RANGE OF STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES THAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS CAN

BROOKES AND BIBLIOMETRY' WITH ST. MATTHEW AND ROBIN HOOD IN FINLAND.
     
DISCUSSES BIBLIOMETRY AND ITS USES, IN CONNECTION WITH A COURSE HELD IN
FINLAND, IN OCT 81. BIBLIOMETRY IS A MATHEMATICAL AID FOR ANALYSING LIBRARY
PROBLEMS. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL LIBRARY STATISTICS, WHICH USE GROUPS, BIBLIOMETRY
RANKS INDIVIDUAL UNITS. IT IS A METHOD BASED ON SIMPLE LOGARITHMIC RELATIONS
AND IS USED TO DESCRIBE GROWTH, OBSOLESCENCE AND SPREAD. ITS USEFULNESS IS
ESPECIALLY APPARENT IN A TIME OF CUTS. GIVES AN EXAMPLE WHICH SHOWS THAT
BIBLIOMETRIC SCALES OF THE USE OF PERIODICALS CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE CUTS,
AND ANOTHER IN WHICH BIBLIOMETRY HAS BEEN USED TO ANALYSE THE ATTRACTION
EXERCISED BY A FEW PERIODICALS AND THEIR EFFECT ON PUBLICATION OF ARTICLES.

TO SELECT THOSE SOURCES, AND PROVIDES A RETROSPECTIVE LIST OF OUTSTANDING
NON-BOOK REFERENCE SOURCES SELECTED BY THE 1979-80 COMMITTEE.
EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNICAL DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPAEDIAS.
     
INCREASING INVOLVEMENT OF BULGARIA'S INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS
AND EXPERTS IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS, HAS LED TO MUCH HIGHER DEMAND
FOR DICTIONARIES, ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND FOREIGN REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS. THE
AUTHOR'S POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH IN MAJOR SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND OTHER
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN SOFIA HAS SHOWN GREAT CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN IN THE
CONTINUOUS UPDATING OF THE RELEVANT COLLECTIONS. THE PUBLICATIONS ARE, AT
LEAST PARTLY, AVAILABLE TO THE USERS IN OPEN ACCESS DEPARTMENTS AND/OR IN
SPECIALISED READING ROOMS, AS IN THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY.
NEVERTHELESS, IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE ACQUISITION DEPARTMENTS PAY EVEN CLOSER
ATTENTION TO REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS. COMPILATION OF A GENERAL CATALOGUE OF ALL
REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS IN THE CAPITAL'S LIBRARIES WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL.
REEDITED EVERY FEW YEARS, OR SUPPLEMENTED WITH AMENDMENTS AND APPENDICES, SUCH
A CATALOGUE WOULD BE AN INVALUABLE ASSET FOR THE PROSPECTIVE COMPUTERISED DATA
BANK OF SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY.
FACING THE PUBLIC.
     
NOTES THE WIDE MEDIA COVERAGE OF CENSORSHIP ATTEMPTS CONCERNING US PUBLIC
LIBRARIES, POINTING OUT THAT LIMITED CENSORSHIP PROBLEMS IN SMALL TOWNS GET

AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL; PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN FINDING MATERIAL AND OPERATING
EQUIPMENT; AND OPINIONS ON THE VALUE OF THE COLLECTION. CONCLUDES THAT THERE
IS A NEED TO IMPROVE AND PROMOTE THE COLLECTION OF CLINICAL AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL; LECTURERS SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE SELECTION AND PROMOTION OF
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL; AND THAT, ALTHOUGH STUDENTS RECOGNISE THE VALUE OF THIS
MATERIAL, AV DOES NOT REPLACE BOOKS OR LECTURES-IT JOINS THEM TO PRODUCE A
SYNERGISTIC EFFECT.

PLOVDIV HAVE THE LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF MAPS AND ATLASES IN BULGARIA. COVERS
ONLY MAPS ISSUED UP TO 1944, IN WHICH BULGARIA IS INCLUDED. THE OLDEST OF THEM
ARE NOT VERY ELABORATE, WITH TEXT IN LATIN ONLY. FROM THE 16TH CENTURY,
PARALLEL TEXT IN GERMAN AND/OR FRENCH WAS ADDED. UP TO THE 18TH CENTURY, THE
MAPS WERE PRINTED AND PUBLISHED MAINLY IN AMSTERDAM, ROME, AUSBURG AND
NUERBURG, BULGARIA'S OWN CARTOGRAPHIC FACILITIES STARTED WITH THE FIRST MAP
PRODUCED BY A BULGARIAN IN BULGARIAN WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1843. EVEN THEN,
HOWEVER, MAPS WERE PRINTED IN VIENNA. ANOTHER STEP FORWARD WAS THE LIBERATION
FROM TURKISH RULE (1878), FOLLOWED BY THE FOUNDATION OF VARIOUS NATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS, HEADED BY THE STATE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE (1891) AND
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA (1898) WITH THE CHAIR OF GEOGRAPHY . THERE WERE ALSO
HISTORIC MAPS PUBLISHED FROM 1878 TO 1944. AMONG THEM, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS
THE MAP OF UPRISING AND CLASS STRUGGLE, AIMING TOWARDS AND EVENTUALLY LEADING
TO THE LIBERATION AND UNIFICATION OF THE BULGARIAN NATION.
LOCAL CARTOBIBLIOGRAPHY-RESOURCE SHARING AT THE GRASS ROOTS.
     
PAPER GIVEN AT A MEETING OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND MAP DIVISION DURING THE SPECIAL
LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE IN HAWAII, JUNE 79. REPORTS A PROJECT, BASED
AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BINGHAMTON, AIMED AT LOCATING AND
ARRANGING ACCESS TO LOCALLY HELD AREA CARTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS. DESCRIBES THE
WAY IN WHICH THE PROJECT WAS CARRIED OUT, AND GIVES BRIEF DETAILS OF THE
RESULTING PUBLICATION-2A GUIDE TO MAPS, ATLASES, AND AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF
BROOME COUNTY, NEW YORK1.
CARTOBIBLIOGRAPHY AND MAP LIBRARIANSHIP' THE STATE OF THE ARTS WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 8TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN MAP CURATORS
CIRCLE, 1980. AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR'S INVESTIGATION INTO CARTOBIBLIOGRAPHY
AND MAP LIBRARIANSHIP IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA (WA) AND THE KEY ROLE OF THE WA
HISTORY DIVISION OF THE WA STATE LIBRARY (THE BATTYE LIBRARY) WITH REFERENCE
TO THE SITUATION IN MAP LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD VISITED BY THE AUTHOR.
AUSTRALIAN MAP CURATORS CIRCLE-9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE.
     
3 PAPERS FROM THE AUSTRALIAN MAP CURATORS CIRCLE'S 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE,
SYDNEY, FEB 81' PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS-MAPS FOR EVERYONE, BY D.F. PRESCOTT;
THEMATIC MAPPING BY THE DIVISION OF NATIONAL MAPPING, BY G.W. PARKINSON (THESE
HAVE NOT BEEN ABSTRACTED); AND PLANNING A NEW MAP LIBRARY, BY W.H. LAMBLE, FOR
AN ABSTRACT OF WHICH +S+E+E THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBER'.
INSURANCE MICROPUBLISHING' A NEW APPROACH.
     
THE CONTINENTAL INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE CREATED A NEW APPROACH TO
MICROPUBLISHING WHICH HAS CONVERTED A SYSTEM THAT FORMERLY CONTAINED OVER 9
FEET OF PRINTED MANUALS DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE TO MORE THAN 2,000 INDIVIDUALS.
THE PAPER MANUAL SYSTEM REQUIRED FREQUENT UPDATING (20-25% OF THE MANUALS WERE
UPDATED MONTHLY) AND WAS USED DAILY BY THE 2,000 RATER/CODERS. INTRODUCES
CONTINENTAL'S MICROFICHE CODING MANUAL SYSTEM-AN EXAMPLE OF AN INSURANCE
COMPANY'S APPLICATION OF MODERN MICROPUBLISHING TECHNOLOGY.
TAPE-SLIDE PROJECTORS FOR LIBRARIES' A TECHNICAL REVIEW.
     
REVIEWS THE TECHNICAL FEATURES OF 3 MODELS OF TAPE-SLIDE PROJECTORS WHICH
APPEAR TO BE SUITABLE FOR USER ACCESS IN LIBRARIES' THE FAIRCHILD
SYNCHROSLIDE' THE SINGER CARAMATE; AND THE BELL & HOWELL RINGMASTER. DISCUSSES
A NUMBER OF POINTS WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN PURCHASING THIS TYPE OF
MACHINE FOR USE IN LIBRARIES.
LIBRARIES IN A SOCIETY OF PICTORIAL ABUNDANCE' DO THEY HONOUR THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY?.
     
PAPER GIVEN AT THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING. DESCRIBES
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VIDEO FIELD, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN
ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES COMPETING ON OUR TV SCREENS. THIS SITUATION HAS BOTH
PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES. THE OUTPUT OF VIDEO CASSETTES CONSISTS MAINLY OF
LOW QUALITY ACTION FILMS AND THE DELAY IN THE PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF
SWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES, WHICH SHOULD HEIGHTEN THE QUALITY, IS REGRETTABLE. BUT
THE NEW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO OFFERS NEW FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND INDEPENDENCE
OF TRANSMISSION TIMES. VIDEO TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL FOR MINORITIES SUCH AS THE
DEAF AND IMMIGRANTS. THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT
LIBRARIES SHOULD SHOW VIDEO FILMS, LEND THEM AND TRANSMIT THEM VIA CABLE.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROVIDER OF VIDEO.
     
DESCRIBES THE AVAILABILITY OF VIDEOTAPES AND EQUIPMENT IN DANISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THIS AMOUNTED IN 1977 TO 5 LIBRARIES. MOST OF THE PROGRAMMES ARE
LOCALLY PRODUCED BY AMATEUR GROUPS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND LOCAL HISTORICAL
PURPOSES. ONLY 1 LIBRARY HAS TAKEN UP THE OFFER OF DEPOSIT OF VIDEO CASSETTES
FROM THE STATE FILM CENTRE. REFERS TO VARIOUS REPORTS WHICH MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
VIDEO IS A MATERIAL WHICH PROPERLY BELONGS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY AND CAN BE
ACQUIRED WITH PUBLIC MONEY. THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMES
AVAILABLE FOR LOAN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS OFTEN BEEN POINTED OUT, BUT THIS
WOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN THE COPYRIGHT ACT OR DIRECT NEGOTIATION BY THE
LIBRARIES WITH THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS. ARCHIVES FOR RADIO AND TV PRODUCTIONS
SHOULD BE SET UP AND THE LAW ON LEGAL DEPOSITS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE NON-BOOK
MATERIAL. COOPERATION WITHIN THE NORDIC COUNCIL IS URGED, AND EXPERIMENTS IN
SELECTED LIBRARIES ARE RECOMMENDED.
THE VIDEO MEDIUM AND THE LIBRARIES' FUTURE PROVISION OF PICTURES.
     
DESCRIBES THE GROWTH OF VIDEO FILMS. CALLS FOR A FORUM OF LIBRARIANS WHO CAN
INITIATE PILOT PROJECTS AND EXAMINE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF VIDEO IN RELATION TO
LIBRARIES. AS THIS MEDIUM IS CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE
THAN FILMS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LIBRARIES COOPERATE WITH OTHER CULTURAL
INSTITUTIONS IN SECURING A QUALITY PRODUCTION TO COUNTERACT THE PRESENT LOW
QUALITY OUTPUT. THE MEDIUM ALSO RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF LIBRARIES
ESTABLISHING WORKSHOPS WHERE EVERYONE CAN USE EQUIPMENT FOR VIDEO PRODUCTION.
DESCRIBES A PROJECT LIBRARY AND VIDEO IN HVIDOVRE PUBLIC LIBRARIES, IN APR 80.
VIDEO PROGRAMMES WERE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE LIBRARY'S VIDEO COLLECTION AND
THROUGH A VIDEO WORKSHOP, IN WHICH THE PUBLIC WERE ENCOURAGED TO EXPERIMENT
WITH THE EQUIPMENT THEMSELVES.
THE USE OF THE SOVIET EXPERIENCE IN THE PROMOTION OF SOCIO-POLITICAL
LITERATURE IN MONGOLIAN LIBRARIES.
     
EMPHASISES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SOCIO-POLITICAL LITERATURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MARXIST-LENINIST OUTLOOK OF THE MONGOLIAN POPULATION AND ITS ROLE IN
THE CURRENT SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING. FORMS AND METHODS OF
WORK WITH SOCIO-POLITICAL LITERATURE IN MONGOLIAN LIBRARIES ARE REVIEWED
INCLUDING EXTENSION WORK. THE ROLE OF SOVIET GUIDANCE IN THE PROMOTION METHODS
EMPLOYED IS STRESSED. FUTURE PLANS WILL INCLUDE THE INTRODUCTION OF A
CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEM, MECHANISATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
SERVICES. THE MONGOLIAN VARIANT OF THE RUSSIAN LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
CLASSIFICATION IS IN PREPARATION.
ESSENTIAL RESEARCH TOOLS FOR CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.
     
OFFERS SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE RESEARCH TOOLS THAT CAN PROVIDE US CRIMINAL
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WITH UP-TO-DATE AND THOROUGH INFORMATION ON CRIMINAL LAW AND
PROCEDURE. THE EMPHASIS IS ON THOSE MATERIALS WHICH ARE MOST WIDELY USED IN
FEDERAL CRIMINAL DEFENSE PRACTICE, ALTHOUGH REFERENCE TO TOOLS USEFUL IN
CALIFORNIA STATE CRIMINAL DEFENSE PRACTICE FURTHER PROVIDES A PARADIGM FOR
MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN A STATE JURISDICTION.
REFERENCE MATERIALS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE' A SELECTIVE ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
THIS ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRPAHY IS A SELECTED GUIDE TO MATERIALS IN THE FIELD OF
CRIMINAL JUSTICE THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE REFERENCE COLLECTIONS OF THE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY. THE
LISTING COVERS MATERIALS RELATED TO THE TOPICS OF CRIME, JUVENILE DELINQUENCY,
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND PENOLOGY; CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE ARE NOT
COVERED. CONTAINING MORE THAN 100 ENTRIES, THE BIBLIOGRAPHY IS DIVIDED INTO 4
SECTIONS' INDEXES AND ABSTRACTS, BIBLIOGRAPHIES, DICTIONARIES/DIRECTORIES, AND
GENERAL WORKS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
DIRECTORY OF ORGANIZATIONS WORKING FOR WOMEN'S EDUCATIONAL EQUITY.
     
THIS LISTING IDENTIFIES ORGANISATIONS WHICH HAVE WOMEN'S CONCERNS AS A MAJOR
FOCUS, AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH PROVIDE TRAINING PROGRAMMES, WORKSHOPS,
CONFERENCES, SEMINARS, CURRICULA, AND MATERIALS THAT ENHANCE WOMEN'S CAREERS
OR SELF DEVELOPMENT. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
JOURNALS AND CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS OF CHEMICAL HISTORY, EDUCATION AND
DOCUMENTATION.
     
THE APPROPRIATE SECTIONS OF VOLUMES 70 AND 71 (1969) AND 90 AND 91 (1979) OF
2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1WERE SEARCHED TO LOCATE ALL PAPERS AND CONFERENCE
PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO CHEMICAL HISTORY, EDUCATION, AND DOCUMENTATION. A
TABULATION WAS MADE OF THE NUMBER OF ITEMS PUBLISHED IN EACH AREA BY JOURNAL
AND LANGUAGE OF PUBLICATION. A COMPARISON WAS MADE OF THE CHANGING PATTERNS OF
PUBLICATION.
THE BEILSTEIN HANDBOOK OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY' THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS.
     
THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF 2BEILSTEIN'S HANDBOOK OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY1 IS
REVIEWED, AND THE GENERAL VALUE AND SIGNIFICANCE AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPAL
CONCEPTS AND MAIN GOALS OF THIS UNIQUE WORK IN THE FIELD OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
ARE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED.
REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPLY OF LITERATURE IN PHARMACEUTICAL TRAINING.
     
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS AND OTHER
NATURAL SCIENCE TRAINING. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF TRAINING
ACTUALLY IS, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT PHARMACISTS MUST BE TRAINED TO PRACTISE
IMMEDIATELY IN A PHARMACY, AT A SICK-BED, IN A RESEARCH INSTITUTE OR A
PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY. THOSE INVOLVED IN TRAINING NEED SPECIALIST BOOKS AND
JOURNALS. IN HUNGARY, THESE CAN BE PURCHASED BY EVERYBODY, ALTHOUGH PURCHASE
OF FOREIGN MATERIALS MAY BE FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT. LIBRARY BUDGETS SHOULD
PERMIT THE PURCHASE OF EXPENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, AND
REFERENCE BOOKS, LIBRARIANS INSISTING ON THEIR CONTINUOUS ACQUISITION.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED BY BUDGETS WHICH FOLLOW PROPORTIONAL PRICE
INCREASE, AND BY GOVERNMENTS WILLING TO REDUCE IMPORT PROFIT RATES OF
MATERIALS FOR EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND MEDICAL TREATMENT. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE
WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TERMINOLOGY, TRAINING SYSTEM AND LITERATURE OF THEIR
FIELD, AND BE QUALIFIED TO INTRODUCE READERS TO INTELLECTUAL WORK.
FILMS ON MENTAL RETARDATION.
     
PUBLIC LAW 94-142, THE US EDUCATION OF ALL HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ACT OF 1975,
HAS BROUGHT A NEW AWARENESS OF THE NEEDS AND PROBLEMS OF THE HANDICAPPED.
LIBRARIANS CAN HELP TO DEVELOP THIS AWARENESS, PARTICULARLY AMONGST CHILDREN,
BY PROVIDING FILMS. PRESENTS AN ANNOTATED LIST OF FILMS ABOUT THE MENTALLY
RETARDED AND THEIR ROLE IN SOCIETY.
A PICTURE LENDING SCHEME' THE DUBLIN EXPERIENCE.
     
DUBLIN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INITIATED A PICTURE LENDING SCHEME IN 1979. DISCUSSES
THE OPERATION UNDER' GENERAL POLICY; STOCK COVERAGE; SELECTION PROCESS;
CATALOGUING; THE VISUAL RECORD; FRAMING; DISPLAY AND STORAGE; AND REGULATIONS.
FRAMING TAKES MORE THAN 50% OF THE COST OF THE COMPLETED PICTURE.
MICROFORMS AND ART LIBRARIES.
     
FROM THE DUAL REFERENCE POINTS OF 2MICROFORM REVIEW'S1 SUMMER 79 VISUAL ARTS
ISSUE AND THE ART LIBRARIES SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN
FEB 81, EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF MICROFORMATTED
VISUAL MATERIALS FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH. PERSISTENT PROBLEMS PERTAINING TO
RESOLUTION, COLOUR FIDELITY AND PERMANENCE, AND LARGE AUDIENCE IMAGE DISPLAY
ARE DISCUSSED AGAINST SOME NEW TRENDS IN PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION WHICH
CAN VASTLY INCREASE THE HOLDINGS AND RESEARCH CAPACITIES OF INDIVIDUAL
INSTITUTIONS.
DEICHMAN LIBRARY AND SERIES BOOKS FOR CHILDREN.
     
IN SPRING 79 DEICHMAN LIBRARY, OSLO, STOPPED BUYING CHILDREN'S SERIES BOOKS
AND DISCARDED WORN-OUT STOCK COPIES. THEY WERE SURPRISED BY HOSTILE PUBLIC
REACTION (A SELECTION OF READERS' LETTERS TO OSLO NEWSPAPERS IS APPENDED),
HAVING REGARDED THE MOVE AS CORRECTING A LONG-STANDING MISTAKE. SINCE THE
MID-60S DEICHMAN HAD BOUGHT A FEW COPIES OF 2HARDY BOYS1 AND SIMILAR TITLES,
RECOGNISED AS SUB-STANDARD LITERATURE, BUT INTENDED TO LEAD CHILDREN TO BETTER
BOOKS AND INCREASE THE THEN INADEQUATE SELECTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. BY
1979 THE STANDARD OF NORWEGIAN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAD GREATLY IMPROVED AND
THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TITLES INCREASED. IN VIEW OF RISING BOOK PRICES,
PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO GOOD NORWEGIAN CHILDREN'S BOOKS RATHER THAN ADULT AND
FOREIGN BOOKS IN CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS (EXCEPTING BOOKS FOR IMMIGRANTS).
SERIES BOOKS WERE EXCLUDED FOR A YEAR AS AN EXPERIMENT.
STATEMENT OF POLICY RELATING TO ARCHIVES.
     
A STATEMENT OF POLICY RELATING TO ARCHIVES IN THE UK DEVELOPED BY THE MUSEUMS
ASSOCIATION, SOCIETY OF ARCHIVISTS AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, WITH AN
INTRODUCTION BY PATRICK J. BOYLAN. THE POLICY COVERS' THE LEGAL POSITION OF
ARCHIVE COLLECTIONS IN MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES; COLLECTING
RESPONSIBILITIES-GENERAL COLLECTIONS; SPECIAL COLLECTIONS; OTHER COLLECTING
AGENCIES; PURCHASE GRANTS; DISPOSAL OF COLLECTIONS; RECORDS MANAGEMENT; AND
AREAS OF POSITIVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE 3 PROFESSIONS.
THE ADMINISTRATION OF A SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY AND THE ORGANISATION
OF THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH LESS THAN 30,000 INHABITANTS MAY
ORGANISE THEIR OWN LIBRARY SERVICE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE REQUIRED BY THE DUTCH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT TO WORK IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE COUNTY LIBRARY
NETWORK. LIBRARY COMMITTEES IN THESE AREAS SHOULD INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVE
CROSS-SECTION OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMITTEE
MEMBERS WITH LOCAL CONNECTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THE AREA. HOWEVER, WHERE THE LOCAL LIBRARY COMMITTEE INSISTS ON FOLLOWING
ITS OWN POLICIES, THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM MAY BE PREVENTED FROM PURSUING A
COORDINATED POLICY FOR ALL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT ITS REGION. THE INTERESTS OF
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN BE SERVED BY THE CREATION OF LIBRARY USERS' COMMITTEES
IN EACH AREA.
A QUEBEC REGIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMITTEE.
     
DESCRIBES THE INCEPTION OF A QUEBEC REGIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMITTEE,
INVOLVING 11 LIBRARIES, IN 1978. INITIALLY CONCEIVED AS A FORUM FOR GENERAL
DISCUSSION, THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES EXPANDED TO INCLUDE STRATEGIES FOR SOLVING
COMMON PROBLEMS SUCH AS ACQUISITION OF NEW EQUIPMENT, AND BULK COOPERATIVE
PURCHASING.
LONG-TERM PLANNING' AN IMPORTANT TASK IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
LONG-TERM PLANNING IS VITAL TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND HAS BEEN A FEATURE OF
SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP SINCE THE 1ST 5-YEAR PLAN. DISCUSSES THE METHODOLOGICAL
ASPECTS ONLY. THE PURPOSE OF LIBRARY PLANNING CAN BE DEFINED AS 'THE CREATION
OF THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR SATISFYING READERS' REQUIREMENTS AND OVERCOMING
INCONSISTENCIES IN THE READING HABITS OF DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUPS'. THE
PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN SUCH PLANNING INCLUDE POLITICAL COMMITMENT AND A
SCIENTIFIC BASIS, AND THERE IS A TENDENCY NOW TO USE A WIDE RANGE OF LOGICAL,
STATISTICAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED MODEL.
PLANNING A NEW MAP LIBRARY.
     
PAPER DELIVERED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN MAP CURATORS
CIRCLE, SYDNEY, FEB 81. THE LIBRARY BOARD OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA IS IN AN
ADVANCED STAGE OF PLANNING A NEW LIBRARY SERVICES BUILDING, THE ALEXANDER
LIBRARY BUILDING. IT WILL CONTAIN 3 MAP COLLECTIONS' ONE WITHIN THE J.S.
BATTYE LIBRARY OF WEST AUSTRALIAN HISTORY AND STATE ARCHIVES, ANOTHER WITHIN
THE GENERAL REFERENCE LIBRARY, AND A MAP LENDING LIBRARY. DISCUSSES THE EFFECT
OF THE LIBRARY BOARD'S HISTORY, ROLE, AND ORGANISATION ON THE MAP COLLECTION
PLANNING OPTIONS; THE GENERAL PLANNING PRINCIPLES USED; AND THE SOLUTION OF
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.
RESEARCH SEMINAR ON TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.
     
REPORT BASED ON A RESEARCH SEMINAR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD,
POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (UK), 20 JUNE 80.
AIMS OF THE SEMINAR WERE' TO ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE PARTICULAR FORCES OF
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE OPERATING UPON LIBRARIES/INFORMATION AGENCIES AND TO
DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE DESERVED SYSTEMATIC STUDY; AND TO DISCUSS AND SUGGEST
RESEARCH TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES APPROPRIATE TO SPECIFIC CHANGE ISSUES AND
PROBLEMS. SUMMARISES THE DISCUSSIONS AND A KEY ADDRESS BY PETER CLARK.
SOME ASPECTS OF LIBRARY NETWORKING IN THE USA.
     
3 TYPES OF AMERICAN LIBRARY NETWORKS ARE DEFINED' ORGANISATIONAL, SPECIALISED
AND FUNCTIONAL. PUBLIC LIBRARIES BELONG TO THE FIRST GROUP, WHOSE PLANNING AND
DEVELOPMENT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE LIBRARIES. SPECIALISED NETWORKS
LINK TOGETHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES DEVOTED TO THE SAME SUBJECT DISCIPLINE
(NATIONWIDE NETWORKS OF MEDICAL OR AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES BELONG TO THIS
GROUP). THE LAST TYPE BRINGS TOGETHER LIBRARIES WHOSE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ARE
BASED ON THE USE OF THE SAME DATA BASE (E.G. OCLC). ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
OF THE NETWORKS IS DISCUSSED TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER ASPECTS INCLUDING
USERS, CENTRALISED CATALOGUING AND BOOK PROCESSING, LONG TERM PLANNING,
COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS, INTERLIBRARY LENDING AND COMPILATION OF UNION
CATALOGUES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
THE LIBRARY WITHIN THE COOPERATION BETWEEN TWIN TOWNS.
     
THE IMPORTANCE OF TWINNING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN NORDIC TOWNS FOR THE
FURTHERANCE OF NORDIC CULTURE IS RECOGNISED, BUT THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN THIS
COOPERATION IS NOT CLEAR. THE LIBRARY IS THE NATURAL POINT FOR COLLECTION OF
MATERIAL ABOUT THE TWIN TOWNS AND FOR THE TRANSFER OF MATERIAL FROM THE HOME
TOWN TO THE TWIN TOWNS. IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE READING OF THE NEIGHBOURING
COUNTRIES' LITERATURE. DESCRIBES THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN JAMTLAND
REGIONAL LIBRARY IN SWEDEN, AND SOUTH TRONDELAG LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE
REGIONAL LIBRARY IN TRONDHEIM, NORWAY. JOINT SEMINARS ON NORDIC LITERATURE ARE
HELD EVERY OTHER YEAR. IT IS HOPED EVENTUALLY TO EXTEND COOPERATION TO THE
FINNISH AND DANISH TWIN TOWNS.
INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA PROGRAMS IN THE STATE LIBRARY NETWORK. A POLICY STATEMENT.
     
THE POLICY BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES AND USERS STAND
TO BENEFIT FROM INCREASED COOPERATION WAS ADOPTED BY THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT
OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN 1979. THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT OF BOTH FORMAL AND
INFORMAL COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IS ENCOURAGED AS A MEANS TO FACILITATE
RESOURCE SHARING AMONG ALL SCHOOLS WITHIN A DISTRICT. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE
FROM NTIS.
REGIONAL SUPPORTING LIBRARIES IN THE NETHERLANDS' THE PROVINCIALE BIBLIOTHEEK
VAN ZEELAND.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION) IN THE MID-60S IN THE NETHERLANDS A MEETING OF ABOUT 50
LIBRARIANS FROM PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES ATTEMPTED TO FIND A SOLUTION TO
THE PROBLEMS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND THE PROVISION OF STUDY LITERATURE TO
NON-UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. 2 ANSWERS WERE DISCUSSED' (1) A CENTRALISED
LITERATURE PROVISION SYSTEM, IN WHICH 1 SCHOLARLY LIBRARY WOULD BE SET UP TO
SERVE THE NON-UNIVERSITY STUDENTS; AND (2) A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM, ENSURING
THAT STUDY LITERATURE WOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH A NETWORK OF REGIONAL CENTRAL
LIBRARIES BASED IN THE PROVINCES, AS SUPPORTING LIBRARIES FOR THE
UNIVERSITIES. 12 SUCH PROVINCIAL LIBRARIES WERE PROPOSED. REVIEWS THE PROBLEMS
ENCOUNTERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM IN THE 70S, THE NEED FOR
COOPERATION, AND THE PRESENT SYSTEM.
NETWORKS AND NEWS-ONE WOMEN'S VIEW OF THE 1981 CONFERENCE.
     
A REPORT ON THE UK SERIALS GROUP ANNUAL CONFERENCE, MAR 81, MANCHESTER. THE
THEME WAS COOPERATION IN SERIALS LIBRARIANSHIP AND INCLUDED COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING, SUBJECT SPECIALISATION AND RESOURCE
SHARING IN AFRICA.
APPROACHES TO FORECASTING DEMANDS FOR LIBRARY NETWORK SERVICES.
     
THE PROBLEM OF FORECASTING MONTHLY DEMANDS FOR LIBRARY NETWORK SERVICES IS
CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF USING FORECASTS AS INPUTS TO POLICY
ANALYSIS MODELS AND IN TERMS OF THE USE OF FORECASTS AS AN AID TO BUDGETING
AND STAFFING DECISIONS. FORECASTING METHODS CONSIDERED INCLUDE BOX-JENKINS
TIME-SERIES METHODOLOGY, ADAPTIVE FILTERING, AND LINEAR REGRESSION. USING
DEMAND DATA FROM THE ILLINOIS LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK FOR 1971-78, IT
IS SHOWN THAT FADING-MEMORY REGRESSION IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD, IN
TERMS OF BOTH ACCURACY AND EASE OF USE.
OHIO REGIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS AS PROPOSED BY THE OHIO
MULTITYPE INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION COMMITTEE.
     
THE ESSENCE OF THE PROPOSED OHIO REGIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM IS TO
PROVIDE EVERY OHIOAN ACCESS TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESOURCES AND SERVICES
THROUGH MULTITYPE LIBRARY COOPERATION. OUTLINES FACTORS INFLUENCING THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE OHIO REGIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM; ITS PURPOSE;
SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION, STRUCTURE, AND OPERATION; FUNDING; AND DEFINITIONS.
ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SYSTEM.
TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE REGIONAL APPROACH TO LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE PROVISION OF
REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES IS NOW BECOMING APPARENT. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW
THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES WILL
NECESSITATE THE CREATION OF A NETWORK OF WELL-STOCKED LIBRARIES IN EACH
REGION. IN ORDER TO FINANCE SUCH A POLICY WHILST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE
SUFFERING SEVERE ECONOMIC RESTRAINTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUGGESTED THAT LESS
ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE RECREATIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN
ADDITION, RESEARCH BY THE BIBLIOTHEEKRAAD (LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL) INTO
INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT
COOPERATION ON ACQUISITION POLICIES AMONGST THE LIBRARIES OF EACH REGION. IN
ORDER TO BRING LIBRARIES TOGETHER IN CLOSER COOPERATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY
TO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS AND TO CHANGE THE PRESENT
LAW RELATING TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
POLITICAL SETTING OF LIBRARIES IN POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS.
     
DISCUSSES THE RELEVANCE OF POLITICAL POWER TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF A
POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTION LIBRARY, IN RELATION TO THE REPORTING STRUCTURE,
LIBRARY/SENATE RELATIONS, STATUS OF THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE, THE ROLE OF THE
CHIEF LIBRARIAN AND OTHER LIBRARIANS ON UNIVERSITY COMMITTEES, INDEPENDENCE OF
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT, PROTECTION OF THE LIBRARY, NETWORKS, AND RELATIONS WITH
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.
THE INVISIBLE LIBRARY.
     
ARGUES THAT THE NEGLECT OF PR ACTIVITIES BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS LED TO AN
INCREASING LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BASIC AIMS AMONG POLITICIANS AND A
CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN THEIR BUDGETS. THE LIBRARY SERVICE OCCUPIES A MODEST
PLACE IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE COMPARED TO OTHER SECTORS BECAUSE IT HAS NO
COMPETITORS AND THE PUBLIC LACKS A BASIS FOR COMPARISON. LIBRARY MATTERS GET
LITTLE PUBLICITY EITHER IN THE NATIONAL, LOCAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRESS. ACTIONS
BY USER GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ARE GENERALLY RESPECTED CITIZENS, CAN BE
VERY EFFECTIVE AND CONTACT WITH ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
AND THE TRADE UNIONS SHOULD BE NURTURED BY THE LIBRARY. THIS COULD TAKE THE
FORM OF 'FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS, AS FOUND LARGELY IN THE USA, OR, MORE
IN LINE WITH DANISH PRACTICE, USER COUNCILS.
LOBBYING FOR LIBRARIES.
     
INTERVIEWS EILEEN COOKE, LEADER OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S
WASHINGTON OFFICE. THE OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1945. IT HAS HELPED TO BRING
ABOUT THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BUILDING OF MANY NEW LIBRARIES. BUT THE PASSING OF THE ACT DOES NOT
ENSURE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF GRANTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN,
PERSISTENT LOBBYING OF THE CONGRESS COMMITTEE IS NECESSARY. THE OFFICE KEEPS
INTERESTED CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES INFORMED OF LIBRARY ISSUES, FOLLOWS THE
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN RELEVANT AREAS, AND BRIEFS MEMBERS BEFORE HEARINGS, BUT
IT IS NOT ALLOWED, NOR DOES IT SEEK TO, GIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUAL
CANDIDATES' ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.
PROFESSIONAL DIRECTIVES OF THE 6TH FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
AN EXTRACT FROM A HUNGARIAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE DOCUMENT WHICH LAYS DOWN THE
EDUCATIONAL TASKS FOR THE 6TH 5 YEAR PLAN. LIBRARIANS MUST AIM FOR 3
OBJECTIVES' TO DEVELOP INFORMATION ACTIVITY IN THE FIELD OF SPECIAL
LITERATURE; TO EXTEND THE CIRCLE OF LIBRARY USERS (PARTICULARLY YOUNG
READERS); AND TO IMPROVE COOPERATION BY DEVELOPING SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND THE
QUALITY OF THEIR SERVICES. THE DIRECTIVE CONSIDERS IN DETAIL THE PROBLEMS OF
CENTRALISED LIBRARY SERVICES, THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED FOR RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT AND THE SPECIAL TASKS OF LIBRARIES ACCORDING TO THEIR FUNCTION.
EXCERPTS FROM NEW YORK STATE EDUCATION LAW, RULES OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS, AND
REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION PERTAINING TO PUBLIC AND FREE
ASSOCIATION LIBRARIES, LIBRARY SYSTEMS, TRUSTEES AND LIBRARIANS.
     
THIS COLLECTION OF EXCERPTS CONTAINS NEW YORK STATE EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION,
BOARD OF REGENTS REGULATIONS, AND THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION'S RULES
RELATED TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES, LIBRARY NETWORKS, BOARDS OF TRUSTEES, AND LIBRARY
PROFESSIONALS. IT INCLUDES ALL PERTINENT CHANGES IN EDUCATIONAL LAW ENACTED
THROUGH THE OCTOBER 1979 LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND CHANGES OF REGENTS RULES AND
COMMISSIONER'S REGULATIONS THROUGH THE REGENTS MEETING IN NOVEMBER 1979.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
BEFORE A NEW LIBRARY LAW' THE SERVICE LEVEL MUST BE PRESERVED, BUT THE RATE OF
INCREASE LOWERED.
     
INTERVIEW WITH LASSE BUDTZ, CHAIRMAN OF THE DANISH FOLKETING'S CULTURAL
COMMITTEE AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY SPOKESMAN ON LIBRARY AFFAIRS. THE
PROPOSAL FOR A NEW LIBRARY LAW WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE SESSION 1981-82, AND IT IS HOPED TO GET BROAD PARTY SUPPORT
FOR IT. THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTS, NOT A JOINT DIRECTORATE, BUT LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER RESPONSIBLE FOR TASKS COMMON TO PUBLIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INTERLENDING SERVICES. WOULD PREFER SCHOOL LIBRARIES TO
BELONG UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY, BUT THEY SHOULD CATER FOR LEISURE READING
AS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE LEFT
TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATION OF COMPREHENSIVENESS IN BOOK SELECTION, AND LOCAL
POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT EXERCISE ANY FORM OF CENSORSHIP PRIOR TO SELECTION.
STANDS FIRM ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NO CHARGE FOR ANY LIBRARY SERVICES. LIBRAR IES
CANNOT BE IMMUNE FROM CUTS AND THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR WAS AN ATTEMPT TO RETAIN
THE LEVEL OF SERVICES WHILE LOWERING THE RATE OF INCREASE.
A NEW CANADIAN FEDERAL LAW ON ARCHIVES.
     
CONSIDERS THE PRESENT SITUATION RELATING TO CANADIAN ARCHIVES AND DISCUSSES
THE KIND OF LEGISLATION REQUIRED TO ENSURE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE ARCHIVE
OPERATION, PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE NEW LAW. SURVEYS BRIEFLY THE
RECENT SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AFFECTING ARCHIVES, AND SUMMARISES TO
DATE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING THE
LAW. EXAMINES THE DEBATE ON LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS,
AND PUBLIC AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES, AND ANALYSES THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEFINING
ARCHIVAL DOCUMENTS, THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES, AND THE FUNCTIONS OF
ARCHIVES IN GENERAL. IN CONCLUSION, EMPHASISES AS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THE
NEED TO SAFEGUARD GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND EQUALLY TO FACILITATE ACCESS FOR
RESEARCHERS, BY RESTRUCTURING THE ARCHIVE SYSTEM SO THAT IT CAN ADAPT TO
MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
BRITISH AND SCANDINAVIAN LAWS ON AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
A STUDY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN UK, DENMARK, FINLAND AND NORWAY. A
COMMON FEATURE OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE DUTY OF LIBRARIES TO PROVIDE
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL IN THEIR COLLECTIONS.
RESOURCE NOTEBOOK ON ORGANIZATION.
     
FOCUSES ON IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY ORGANISATION. THE INTRODUCTION PROVIDES
BACKGROUND AND A REVIEW OF ANALYTICAL METHODS. THE FIRST SECTION PROVIDES
EXAMPLES OF DATA GATHERING TOOLS AND APPROACHES TO GATHERING INFORMATION. THE
SECOND GROUP OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATES METHODS OF DESCRIBING AND ANALYSING
LIBRARY ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES AND RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE FINAL SECTION
CONTAINS EXAMPLES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENT WHICH HAVE
BEEN MADE BY LIBRARIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
OMS ANNUAL REPORT, 1979.
     
1979 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES,
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
HEIGHTENING THE SCIENTIFIC POTENTIAL.
     
HEIGHTENING LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS MEANS IMPROVING THE WORK OF METHODOLOGICAL
CENTRES, (MCS). LIBRARY CENTRALISATION, 1974-80, WAS THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF
MCS AND CULTURAL AGENCIES. IN THE 11TH 5-YEAR-PLAN MCS MUST IMPROVE
CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS AS A UNIFIED INSTITUTION WHOSE STOCKS CAN FULFIL
ENHANCED PUBLIC DEMAND. IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY IN' LIBRARIANS' AND
READERS' BIBLIOGRAPHIC TRAINING; REFERENCE STOCK; FORMATION OF BOOKSTOCKS;
DISTRIBUTION OF METHODOLOGICAL PUBLICATIONS; MC COORDINATION. TO ASSIST
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS A SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGICAL AID TO USSR
LIBRARIES IS NEEDED. A DOCUMENT WILL SHORTLY APPEAR CONCERNING PROGRESSIVE
METHODS OF WORK IN LIBRARIES AND MCS. COORDINATION OF MCS IN THE USSR LIBRARY
SYSTEM AIMS FOR BETTER RESULTS IN METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR LIBRARIES.
CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY' LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND ACTION FOR FEDERAL
ASSISTANCE 1938 TO 1956.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY.) EXAMINES THE ACTIONS OF THE US
CONGRESS, 1938-56 WITH RESPECT TO LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATING FEDERAL
FUNDS FOR THE EXTENSION AND IMPROVEMENT OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, LEADING TO
THE LIBRARY SERVICES ACT, 1956. INCLUDES HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR
THE PASSAGE AND FAILURE OF SUCH LEGISLATION.
INTERIM REPORT WITH MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR LIBRARIES.
     
THE LATEST INTERIM REPORT FROM THE NORWEGIAN JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL
GOVERNMENT REFORM, 2NEW FINANCE SYSTEM FOR COUNTY AUTHORITIES1, COULD
SERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IF ITS PROPOSALS ARE IMPLEMENTED, FINANCIAL
ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE
ABOLISHED, AND STATE SUBSIDIES GIVEN ONLY WHERE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. STATE
SUPPORT OF LIBRARIES AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS CONSIDERED NEITHER DESIRABLE
NOR NECESSARY. THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE, IN REPLY, CONSIDERS THE PRESENT STATE
GRANTS VITAL IN OPERATING A SATISFACTORY LIBRARY SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE
LIBRARY ACT. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT LEGALLY OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER COUNTY
LIBRARIES; WITHOUT STATE SUPPORT, LIBRARIES MIGHT RECEIVE ONLY MINIMAL SUMS,
LEADING AT WORST TO THE CLOSURE OF COUNTY LIBRARY SERVICES IN SOME COUNTIES.
SINCE PUBLIC AND MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE NOWADAYS CLOSELY LINKED TO COUNTY
LIBRARIES, THIS WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE PROVISION OF  AN ADEQUATE NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICE.
WILL THE STATE TAKE THE FINANCIAL BACKBONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY ACT?.
     
STATE GRANTS TO THE VEST-AGDER (NORWAY) COUNTY LIBRARY AMOUNTED IN 1980 TO 35%
OF ITS BUDGET. RECENT PROPOSALS BY THE JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT
REFORM WOULD MEAN THE WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUPPORT. IF RESPONSIBILITY FOR
LIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARY
DUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SINCE EVEN THE
REVISED LIBRARY ACT OF 1971 DID NOT OBLIGE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A LIBRARY
SERVICE, THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED LARGELY THROUGH THE
INFLUENCE AND SUPPORT OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. THE BASIS FOR THE 1971 ACT WAS THE
LONG-STANDING REGIONAL IMBALANCE IN SCHOOL LIBRARY AND PUBLIC LIBRARY
STANDARDS. UNDER THE NEW PROPOSALS, LIBRARIES IN THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS WOULD
BE IN MOST DANGER, AND CULTURAL ACTIVITY AS A WHOLE WOULD BE VULNERABLE TO
POLITICAL MOTIVATION.
METROPOLITAN PUBLIC LIBRARY FUNDING AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL RELATIONS'
CONCEPTS AND ISSUES.
     
COMPETITION AMONG THE MANY PUBLIC SERVICES FOR TAX SUPPORTED FUNDING IS A
MAJOR CONCERN FOR METROPOLITAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SEEKING FINANCIAL SUPPORT.
PROBLEMS IN LIBRARY FINANCING ARE INTERWOVEN THROUGH THE FABRIC OF ISSUES
FUNDAMENTAL TO U.S. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIFE AND CANNOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING THEIR COMPLEXITIES. THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH PATTERNS OF
METROPOLITAN AREAS AS OPPOSED TO THEIR ACTUAL LEGAL TAX RAISING BOUNDARIES ARE
A CRITICAL FACTOR. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
FACING THE PUBLIC.
     
BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE EFFECT THAT INCREASED US FEDERAL FUNDINGS FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WOULD HAVE ON THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY BOARDS AND ARGUES THAT
TRUSTEES MUST FIGHT HARDER TO GET MONEY FOR LIBRARIES FROM CITY COUNCILS.
FROM THE STATE LIBRARIAN.
     
DISCUSSES THE BUDGET CUTS INFLICTED ON THE WESTERN AUSTRALIA LIBRARY BOARD IN
THE 1980-81 FINANCIAL YEAR, PARTICULARLY THE 10.24% CUT IN THE BOOK FUND.
STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES IN MODERN AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY AND REGRETS
THAT GREATER USE OF LIBRARIES AND SUCH SEVERE CUTS HAVE COINCIDED.
A SURVEY OF BUSINESS MANAGERS AND LIBRARY DIRECTORS TO IDENTIFY THE VARIABLES
AFFECTING THE FINAL DECISION ON LIBRARY BUDGETS IN INSTITUTIONS AWARDING AT
LEAST THE BACCALAUREATE, BUT LESS THAN THE DOCTORATE DEGREE.
     
(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) 75 INSTITUTIONS, 5.3% WERE RANDOMLY
SELECTED FROM A 1,412 POPULATION AND SURVEYED IN MAR 78. A TOTAL OF 125
(83.3%) QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED FROM 150 MAILED TO BUSINESS MANAGERS AND
LIBRARY DIRECTORS OF SAMPLE INSTITUTIONS. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS RETURNED BY
EITHER THE BUSINESS MANAGER, LIBRARY DIRECTOR OR BOTH FROM 73 OF THE 75 SAMPLE
INSTITUTIONS GIVING AN INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE OF 97.3%. 49 BUDGETING VARIABLES
WERE IDENTIFIED BY LIBRARY DIRECTORS AND 45 BY BUSINESS MANAGERS WITH 38
COMMON VARIABLES. BY COMBINING THE WEIGHTED PERCENTAGE OF EACH VARIABLE, THE
OVERALL TOP 10 BUDGETING VARIABLES WERE FOUND. A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE ON
LIBRARIANSHIP AND HIGHER EDUCATION, AN ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE VARIABLES
AND THOSE IDENTIFIED BY TH E SAMPLE RESPONDENTS, REVEALED THAT THE VARIABLES
CHOSEN BY RESPONDENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE LITERATURE.
THE NEXT DECADE: WHAT WILL IT MEAN TO LIBRARIES? FACSIMILE: THE LONG DISTANCE
COPYING MACHINE.
     
OUTLINES THE FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES OF FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT AND
IDENTIFIES SOME DEVELOPMENTS NEEDED TO MAKE THE EQUIPMENT'S USE ECONOMIC IN
LIBRARIES (FLAT-BED MACHINES WITH STAFF-SAVING DEVICES, CONSIDERABLE DROP IN
PRICE, AND BASING OF COMMUNICATION COSTS ON USE RATHER THAN DISTANCE).
INTEGRATING MICROGRAPHICS WITH WORD PROCESSING.
     
IN 1974, THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (CRS) INSTALLED A WORD PROCESSING
(WP) SYSTEM TO MEET EXPANDING CONGRESSIONAL NEEDS. THE WP SYSTEM INCREASED
OUTPUT, STRAINING THE ABILITY OF CRS TO HANDLE ITS STORAGE NEEDS. PAPER WAS
USED FOR QUICK DISTRIBUTION OF EYE-READABLE MATERIALS, MAGNETIC TAPE FOR QUICK
RETRIEVAL OF MACHINE-READABLE STORAGE, AND MICROFORM FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.
MAINTAINING COMPATIBILITY AMONG THE 3 STORAGE SYSTEMS BECAME A FORMIDABLE
TASK, AND THE SOLUTION SEEMED TO BE TO INTEGRATE STORAGE TO 1 MEDIUM.
MICROFORMS OFFERED THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF MEETING THE TOTAL STORAGE
REQUIREMENTS.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
     
ANALYSES THE INFORMATION SITUATIONS WHERE NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN USEFULLY BE
EMPLOYED AND DISCUSSES THE LEARNING WHICH IS NECESSARY TO AVOID POSSIBLE
PROBLEMS IN HARNESSING THIS CHEAPER POWER. DESCRIBES SOME DIFFICULTIES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY GENERALLY AND
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED WITH LOW COST EQUIPMENT.
PRESENTS THE COST OF CUSTOM MADE SOFTWARE AND THE EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO
CREATE PERSONAL PROGRAMS. ALSO GIVES DETAILS OF PITFALLS WHICH THE NEW USER
USUALLY FAILS TO APPRECIATE, INCLUDING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER HOUSEKEEPING
ROUTINES, DOCUMENTATION AND SECURITY OF DATA.
MINIS, MICROS AND TERMINALS FOR LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES'
PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE ORGANIZED JOINTLY BY THE INSTITUTE OF
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS AND THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SPECIALIST GROUP OF THE
BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY, HELD AT THE NATIONAL COMPUTING CENTRE, MANCHESTER,
6-7 NOVEMBER 1980.
     
PROCEEDINGS OF A CONFERENCE ORGANISED TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION
SCIENTISTS IN THEIR CHOICE OF APPROPRIATE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. FOR ABSTRACTS OF
THE INDIVIDUAL PAPERS SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'-.
OF MEN AND MACHINES.
     
DISCUSSES THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPUTER AND ITS APPLICATION TO
LIBRARIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INDIA. CONCLUDES THAT BEFORE COMPUTERS ARE
INSTALLED IN LIBRARIES, FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND SURVEYS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO
FIND OUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS. REVEALS
THAT OTHER ASPECTS OF MECHANISATION HAVE A GREATER IMPACT THAN COMPUTERISATION
ALONE.
LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.
     
THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2 QUESTIONS' WHETHER
COMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM IN
PARTICULAR IS OF VALUE. INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS MEANS THAT LIBRARY STAFF
BECOME DEPENDENT ON EXPERTS. AS PROCESSES BECOME AUTOMATED THEY ALSO BECOME
DEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF.
SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOME
ROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIER
TO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THE
LIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE,
EXPERIENCED USERS, BUT DISCOURAGES THE INEXPERIENCED AND THE BROWSERS. THE
COST OF GATHERING OF STATISTICS THROUGH THROUGH BUMS AND TRAINING OF STAFF IN
DATA TECHNOLOGY MUST BE SET AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE USES OF THE RESOURCES.
AS AMERICAN AS HAMBURGERS AND APPLE PIE.
     
SUMS UP THE IMPRESSIONS OF AUTOMATION IN US LIBRARIES. MOST LARGER LIBRARY
SYSTEMS HAVE NOW AUTOMATED THEIR TECHNICAL PROCESSES, BUT AUTOMATION OF THE
MORE COMPLICATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, SUCH AS LITERATURE SEARCHING WHICH
NECESSITATE UNIFORM AND WELL DEVELOPED CATALOGUING, IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE
PROCESS OF AUTOMATION STARTED IN THE 60S SPURRED LARGELY BY THE GENERAL US
OPENNESS TOWARDS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PRESSURE FROM COMMERCIAL
FIRMS. THE LACK OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION AND OF STANDARDISATION OF WORK
ROUTINES IN US PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS ENCOURAGED THE ADOPTION OF AUTOMATION
SYSTEMS TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES. THE GENERAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION
HAS NOT BEEN MUCH STUDIED, BUT THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY
HAD LED TO CENTRALISATION, LESS INDEPENDENCE FOR BRANCHES, BETTER
INTERLENDING, AND HAD FREED RESOURCES FOR OTHER SERVICES. ALTHOUGH FEWER STAFF
TENDED TO BE EMPLOYED, NONE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY MADE REDUNDANT. NO COST-BENEFIT
ANALYSES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE REACTIONS OF USERS, BOTH STAFF
AND READERS, WERE LARGELY FAVOURABLE, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN BRANCH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
A SURVEY OF THE STATUS OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN LOUISIANA.
     
A SURVEY ON THE EXTENT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN
LOUISIANA WAS UNDERTAKEN. THE SURVEY MADE INQUIRY INTO SUCH AREAS AS DATA
PROCESSING STAFFING, LIBRARY HARDWARE, COMPUTER SERVICE BILLING, FUTURE
APPLICATIONS, SHARED PROGRAMMES, FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION,
AUTOMATION BENEFITS, AUTOMATION SUITABILITY, AND INHIBITING FACTORS. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PLANNING FOR NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
LOW COST COMPUTING HARDWARE WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, OR THE REVISION OF
EXISTING, INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE PROCEDURES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THE
PLANNING STAGE OF SUCH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE COSTS INVOLVED AND
THE DECISION MAKING IS MORE IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OR UNIT WITHIN AN
ORGANISATION THAN IT WAS. A STAGED PROCEDURE WITH A CHECKLIST OF ACTIVITIES,
APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION AND CONSIDERATIONS TO BE TAKEN AT EACH STAGE IS 1
WAY TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF ERROR IN THE DECISIONS MADE IN THE PLANNING
PROCESS.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROMOTER OF TECHNO-FASCISM' THE (ANTI-)SOCIAL
CONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION.
     
MODERN SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, INSUFFICIENT
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION. THE
PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE NETHERLANDS HAVE UNDERTAKEN
NO STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THEIR MEMBERS' BEHALF APART FROM THE
NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND
LITERATURE), WHICH IN 1979 FORMED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WAYS OF
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE MISUSE OF PERSONAL
INFORMATION IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
COMMITTEE WERE REJECTED IN 1980 BY NBLC MEMBERS AS TOO RADICAL. AUTOMATION
WILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF POSTS IN LIBRARIES AT ALL LEVELS AND
LIBRARIANS MUST ACT NOW TO PREVENT A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE SITUATION.
MINICOMPUTERS AND AVAILABLE PACKAGES.
     
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPUTER FIELD IN RECENT YEARS ARE DESCRIBED WITH
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR THE MECHANISATION OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION TASKS. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MINICOMPUTERS A NEW ERA
OPENED UP FOR INFORMATION WORKERS BUT A MAJOR PROBLEM HAD TO BE OVERCOME,
NAMELY THE LACK OF SUITABLE SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE THOSE FACILITIES. FOLLOWING
THE INTRODUCTION OF IBM'S STAIRS PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
ON A LARGE MAINFRAME COMPUTER, SIMILAR PROGRAMS SOON BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE
ON THE RANGE OF MINICOMPUTERS WHICH HAD STARTED TO PENETRATE THE MARKET. MANY
WERE SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION USE; DISCUSSES CAIRS
AND STATUS. A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH CAME WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF WORD
PROCESSORS, PARTICULARLY THE PROGRAMMABLE SHARED LOGIC SYSTEMS. MANUFACTURERS
STARTED TO PRODUCE SPECIFIC SOFTWARE PACKAGES, INCLUDING INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL PROGRAMS, FOR THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. EXAMPLES OF RELEVANT
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND VARIOUS APPLICATIONS ARE GIVEN.
INTELLIGENT TERMINALS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION WORK.
     
DISCUSSES THE NATURE OF INTELLIGENT TERMINALS, THEIR USEFUL FACILITIES, AND
THEIR POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, WITH SPECIAL REGARD TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF
THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION COMMUNITY. SECTION 1 DEALS WITH THE CURRENT BASIC
TERMINAL AND THEN ELABORATES ON THE FACILITIES WHICH MAY BE ADDED TO IMPROVE
ITS INTELLIGENCE, SUCH AS INTERNAL MEMORY, ENHANCED DISPLAY, MULTIPLE
PERIPHERALS, IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS ABILITY, SOPHISTICATED CONTROL
FACILITIES, AND PROGRAMMABILITY. THE FACILITIES ARE DESCRIBED AND SOME IDEA OF
THEIR UTILITY IS GIVEN. THE USES OF THE TERMINAL ARE DISCUSSED IN AREAS SUCH
AS INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, CATALOGUING, TRAINING, DATA ENTRY, AND LIBRARY
HOUSEKEEPING. USEFUL FACILITIES OF AN INTELLIGENT TERMINAL ARE OUTLINED AND
EXAMPLES GIVEN. THE FUTURE IS CONSIDERED UNDER THE HEADINGS OF HARDWARE,
SOFTWARE, AND NETWORKING DEVELOPMENT. HERE PROJECTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TERMINALS AND THEIR USE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
TOWARD A WORK-FORCE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROFESSIONAL.
     
A STUDY OF THE SALARY AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALIST.
STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SETTING.
     
THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE CRUCIAL IN DETERMINING THE SUCCESS OF ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES IN COPING WITH FUTURE DEMANDS AND CONSTRAINTS. ONE MAJOR ELEMENT IN
THIS EFFORT IS DEVELOPING AND EDUCATING EXISTING LIBRARY STAFF. RESULTS OF A
SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN 1979 TO FIND OUT HOW UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES RESPONDED TO
STAFF DEVELOPMENT, ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OF A 1976 SURVEY. MAJOR SUBJECT AREAS
COVERED IN STAFF DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970S AS WELL AS FUTURE TOPICS ARE
IDENTIFIED. STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES STILL NEED
FURTHER GROWTH IN ORDER TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE
1980S.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TASK FORCE TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF RELEASE TIME. A REPORT
TO THE LIBRARY FACULTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
     
BASED ON THE RESPONSES OF 40 LIBRARY FACULTY MEMBERS TO A QUESTIONNAIRE
EXPLORING THE AREA OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, 7 POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS ON RELEASE TIME FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH WERE
DEVELOPED BY A TASK FORCE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
TIME MANAGEMENT FOR LIBRARY STAFF.
     
WITH PRESSURES AND WORK LOADS INCREASING FOR LIBRARY STAFF AT ALL RANKS, WAYS
MUST BE FOUND TO MAXIMISE USE OF TIME. SUGGESTIONS ARE GIVEN FOR BOTH
SUPERVISORS AND OTHER LIBRARY STAFF FOR SETTING PRIORITIES, COPING WITH
STRESS, AND ANALYSING TIME-RELATED ISSUES. A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES FOR
OPTIMISING WORK TIME ARE LISTED.
RATIOS OF STAFF TO USERS. IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY-INFORMATION WORK AND THE
POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION.
     
A STUDY OF THE UK SPECIAL LIBRARY/INFORMATION FIELD. COVERAGE INCLUDES'
STAFF-USER RATIOS; STAFF AND USER POPULATION STRUCTURES; QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE ADEQUACY OF CURRENT STAFFING; TRAFFIC ANALYSIS; AND AUTOMATION
POTENTIAL. DATA WAS COLLECTED BY QUESTIONNAIRE IN LATE OCT 79.
JOB-SHARING IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF JOB SHARING, AND DISCUSSES THE
EXPERIENCES OF 2 LIBRARIANS SHARING A PROFESSIONAL POST IN AN AUSTRALIAN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY. REVIEWS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF JOB SHARING FROM
THE VIEWPOINTS OF BOTH SHARERS AND EMPLOYERS.
APPLICATION OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY TO LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE 1ST AND FOREMOST TASK OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA IS TO EDUCATE THEIR
READERS AND TO EXERCISE INFLUENCE ON THEIR READING HABITS. TO BE CAPABLE OF
PERFORMING THE JOB SUCCESSFULLY, LIBRARIANS MUST ACQUIRE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE
OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY. THUS, THEY WILL NOT ONLY SEE EACH
READER AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH HIS/HER OWN FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND,
PERSONAL QUALITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, BUT THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE
TO MAKE THE BEST OF A LEADER'S AUTHORITY IN A GROUP. EDUCATION OF CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS HAS BENEFITTED FROM COLLABORATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS
AND THE EXPERIENCE GAINED MUST NOW BE USED MORE FULLY IN ADULT EDUCATION. ON
THE OTHER HAND, SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY MUST BE APPLIED TO SET
CRITERIA FOR THE PERSONALITY OF A GOOD LIBRARIAN, LIBRARY MANAGEMENT AND THE
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE OF THE RANK AND FILE LIBRARY STAFF.
LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION WORK' JOB CHARACTERISTICS AND STAFFING NEEDS.
     
RESULTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF A JOB-DESCRIPTION QUESTIONNAIRE TO MEMBERS OF
STAFF IN A REPRESENTATIVE 5% SAMPLE OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION UNITS ARE
REPORTED. THE FORM OF JOB DESCRIPTION, COVERING THE INTELLECTUAL, SOCIAL, AND
PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF THE WORK AND WORK ENVIRONMENT, ENABLES THE PERSONNEL
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE JOBS TO BE INFERRED FAIRLY DIRECTLY. AN ASSESSMENT IS
MADE OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH EXISTING PERSONNEL MEET THE DEMANDS OF THEIR JOBS.
THE WAY IN WHICH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION WORK IS CHANGING, AND THE ROLES OF
MEN AND WOMEN; AND OF GRADUATES ARE DISCUSSED. A JOB CLASSIFICATION BASED ON
CLUSTER ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES IS ALSO ATTEMPTED.

ADMINISTRATION, EITHER AS HEADS OF LARGE RESEARCH LIBRARIES OR AS DIRECTORS OF
LIBRARY SCHOOLS. DISCUSSES PROGRAMMES EITHER DEVELOPED BY OR OF SPECIAL
INTEREST TO THESE LIBRARIANS AND SOME OF THE FACTORS WHICH HAVE INFLUENCED THE
CAREERS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. CONCENTRATES PARTICULARLY ON THE ADVANTAGES FOUND
AND PROBLEMS FACED BY THESE WOMEN IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT AND IN
ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATION.
A NORTH AMERICAN MODEL' TORONTO CITY LIBRARY.
     
OPENED IN 1977, THIS LIBRARY, A CENTRAL LIBRARY IN A SYSTEM WITH 12 BRANCH
LIBRARIES, IS A FINELY DESIGNED MODERN BUILDING STOCKING OVER 2 MILLION
VOLUMES. THE GROUND FLOOR CONTAINS THE GENERAL REFERENCE DEPARTMENT, INCLUDING
QUICK REFERENCE AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES, AND SPECIAL SERVICES INCLUDING
CHAIR LIFTS AND READING EQUIPMENT FOR THE HANDICAPPED, MUSIC STUDIOS
CONTAINING PIANOS AND MEDIA FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC, STUDY CARRELS FOR LANGUAGE
COURSES AND MICROFILM READERS, ROOMS FOR MEETINGS AND A CAFETERIA. THE 12
SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS ARE ARRANGED IN 4 GALLERIES ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR. THEIR

OPERATIONS OUTLINED. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT ON SERVICES AFTER AN INITIAL
10 WEEKS IS PRESENTED, WITH REFERENCE TO PLANS STILL TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
THE SPINE OR THE HEART' THE UNIVERSITY OF JOS IN SEARCH OF A LIBRARY BUILDING
MODEL.
     
THE UNIVERSITY OF JOS, NIGERIA, RECENTLY CONSIDERED THE SPINE LIBRARY BUILDING
CONCEPT (ALSO CALLED LINEAR LIBRARY OR CONTINUUM) ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS KNOWN.
PRESENTS REASONS WHY THIS DESIGN WAS NOT ADOPTED.
JUST LIKE HOME AND CHEAPER THAN THE CAFE.
     
REPORT ON KARUP LIBRARY, WITH AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LIBRARIAN, BIRTE
ELLERMANN. THE LIBRARY IS HOUSED IN A CONVERTED RAILWAY STATION. THE LACK OF
SPACE AND THE RETENTION OF THE OLD INNER WALLS CONTRIBUTE TO THE INTIMATE AND
FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE. 75% OF THE POPULATION USE IT, COMPARED TO 30% BEFORE
CONVERSION. THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S ROOM ON THE 1ST FLOOR IS A POPULAR MEETING
PLACE FOR THE 13-16 YEAR OLDS. B. ELLERMANN, THEN LIBRARIAN AT THE NEARBY
KARUP AIRFORCE BASE, WAS ASKED TO DRAW UP A PLAN FOR THE LIBRARY STRUCTURE IN
THE AREA. HER DECENTRALISED PLAN OF 3 INDEPENDENT LIBRARIES GAVE HER A DANISH
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION PRIZE. LOCAL CRAFTSMEN HAVE EXECUTED HER OWN INTERIOR
DESIGN. EXHIBITIONS ARE MADE LOCALLY, AND BOOKS ARE RECEIVED FROM A LOCAL
BOOKSELLER AND MADE READY IN THE LIBRARY SO THAT THEY REACH THE SHELVES WHILE
STILL TOPICAL.
RECENT TRENDS IN WEST GERMAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BUILDING PLANNING.
     
REVIEWS WEST GERMAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND DESCRIBES 5 BUILDINGS
COMPLETED SINCE 1973 AT' RUHR UNIVERSITY OF BOCHUM; DORTMUND UNIVERSITY;
BIELFELD UNIVERSITY; WESTPHALIAN WILHELMS UNIVERSITY OF MUNSTER; AND BREMEN
UNIVERSITY. SOME COMPARISONS AND CONTRASTS ARE MADE BETWEEN THESE BUILDINGS
AND OTHERS IN WEST GERMANY BUILT OR RESTORED BETWEEN 1945 AND 1973.
COVER PICTURE (WURZBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY).
     
A NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FOR WURZBURG WAS OPENED IN JULY 81 IN A NEW BUILDING
COMPLEX WHICH ALSO COMPRISES BUILDINGS FOR BOTH ARTS AND SCIENCES. OF THE
400,000 VOLUMES ON OPEN SHELVES, 317,000 ARE IN THE MAIN READING ROOM AND
THERE IS SPACE FOR 800,000 ARE IN THE MAIN READING ROOM AND THRE IS SPACE FOR
800,000 VOLUMES OF PERIODICALS. 580 STUDY PLACES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN 5 READING
ROOMS, WITH A FURTHER 71 PLACES IN INDIVIDUAL CARRELS. THE LIBRARY, WHICH ALSO
SERVES AS A REGIONAL LIBRARY FOR LOWER FRANCONIA, IS NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL AT
PRESENT BECAUSE OF STAFF SHORTAGES.
DATELINE-WASHINGTON.
     
AN ACCOUNT OF A TOUR OF THE RENOVATION WORK IN PROGRESS AT THE FOLGER
SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY, ACCOMPANIED BY THE LIBRARY'S DIRECTOR, O.B. HARDISON.
OPENED IN 1932 AS A GIFT FROM THE INDUSTRIALIST HENRY CLAY FOLGER, THE LIBRARY
CONTAINS MATERIAL ON AND ORGANISES ACTIVITIES CONCERNING SHAKESPEAREAN AND
ENGLISH RENAISSANCE STUDIES. THE RENOVATIONS INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
RARE BOOK STORAGE AREA AND A NEW READING ROOM.
SPACE REQUIREMENTS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
THE COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION PUBLISHED ITS REPORT ON SPACE
REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN MAY 81. THE REPORT DEALS WITH 22
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. IN THE 70S THE TOTAL ANNUAL GROWTH OF SHELF METRES WAS
ABOUT 3%. THE COUNCIL FORECASTS A GROWTH OF ABOUT 4% FOR THE 80S. IT DOES NOT
THINK THAT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN MICROFORMS AND COMPUTERISED SERVICES WILL
CHANGE THE SITUATION IN THE NEXT 15 TO 20 YEARS. SOME OF THE COUNCIL'S
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE' SHELF MEASUREMENT FOR COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE THE
FOLLOWING' OPEN SHELVES 6.3 METRES PER SQ METRE; CLOSED ACCESS 8 SHELF METRES
PER SQ METRE; STORAGE 9.3 METRES PER SQ METRE; AND STACKS 19 METRES PER SQ
METRE. A NATIONAL COOPERATIVE STORAGE LIBRARY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. LIBRARIES
SHOULD HAVE MORE ENCLOSED READING ROOMS AND RESEARCH ROOMS.
REDUCING NOISE IN A COLLEGE LIBRARY.
     
INCREASING REPORTS OF NOISE IN THE LIBRARY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
COLLEGE AT CORTLAND PROMPTED INTEREST IN REDUCING NOISE LEVELS. CHAIRS, TABLES
AND CARRELS WERE ADJACENT AND FREQUENTLY ARRANGED IN CLUSTERS; PREVIOUS
RESEARCH INDICATED THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT MAY INCREASE TALKING AND THUS
NOISE LEVELS. IT WAS HYPOTHESISED THAT DISASSEMBLING THE CLUSTERS AND
SEPARATING THE 3 TYPES OF FURNITURE WOULD REDUCE NOISE. A MULTIPLE BASELINE
DESIGN WAS USED WITH 2 MEASURES OF NOISE' AN ELECTROMECHANICAL (OBJECTIVE)
SYSTEM AND SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF PERCEIVED NOISE. RESULTS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE
DUE TO THE OBJECTIVE MEASURE BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SUBJECTIVE RATINGS,
F(1,773)#8.80, P5.005. COMPARES THE UTILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE 2 MEASURES AND
DISCUSSES ISSUES IN NOISE CONTROL IN LIBRARIES.
RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION. TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND IN
LIBRARIES OF HIGHER EDUCATION.
     
IN 1979, AN INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT INTO THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT (E.G.
AUDIO-VISUAL AND REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT) AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC AND HIGHER
EDUCATION LIBRARIES IN HUNGARY. IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION NETWORK, COLLEGE
LIBRARIES WERE THE MOST ILL EQUIPPED WHILE THE LARGE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES HAD
A STOCK OF MODERN EQUIPMENT. IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK, CITY AND VILLAGE
LIBRARIES HAD THE MOST INCOMPLETE STOCKS.
DESIGNED FOR USERS.
     
DISCUSSES THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN OF CHAIRS IN LIBRARIES WITH EXAMPLES OF
FURNITURE PRODUCED BY HERMAN MILLER, INC., KRUEGER INC., CRAMER INDUSTRIES,
INC., EKORNES AND THONET INDUSTRIES, INC.
HOW TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE READERS' WORK IN THE LIBRARY.
     
AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE 5-YEAR-PLAN IS TO SAVE READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT
IN USING LIBRARIES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES SHOW WIDE POTENTIAL. READERS'
REQUESTS ARE TRANSMITTED TO LARGE LIBRARIES' BOOKSTORES ALONG T.V.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. DOCUMENT REPRODUCTION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESSENED
READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT. AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONING, CATALOGUING,
INTERLIBRARY LOANS, SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL ALSO SAVE READERS' TIME. LARGE
LIBRARIES HAVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR ISSUING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, ABSTRACTS, UNION
CATALOGUES. LARGE INFORMATION-COMPUTER CENTRES WILL BE CREATED FOR COLLECTIVE
USE AS INFORMATION TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS. THE STATE AUTOMATED SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD ECONOMISE ON LIBRARIANS' AND READERS'
TIME' THE GOVERNING FACTORS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION.
PHOTOGRAPHY & ITS USE IN LIBRARY WORK.
     
PHOTOGRAPHY HAS TAKEN ON AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN PUBLIC LIBRARY
WORK. MOST OFTEN THOUGHT OF IN TERMS OF OUTREACH WORK AND PUBLICITY, ITS
EFFECT HAS BEEN EVEN MORE DRAMATIC IN THE IMPACT OF MICROFORMS. AMONG READER
SERVICES THE AVAILABILITY OF PHOTOCOPIERS IS ALREADY TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND IN
THE NEAR FUTURE IMPROVED MODELS CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING TONE ILLUSTRATIONS OR
INSTANT COPIERS USING POLAROID FILM WILL BE EQUALLY COMMON. SUGGESTS SOME
IDEAS AND SOME METHODS FOR CREATIVE APPLICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHY IN LIBRARY
WORK, TOGETHER WITH SUFFICIENT TECHNICAL INFORMATION TO ENABLE THE
NON-PHOTOGRAPHER TO PUT THEM INTO EFFECT.
PRACTICAL PUBLIC RELATIONS' EFFECTIVE PR TECHNIQUES FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY/MEDIA
SPECIALISTS.
     
THIS HANDBOOK OF PUBLICITY IDEAS SUGGESTS ACTIVITIES AND THEMES TO HIGHLIGHT

STUDENTS, FACULTY, ADMINISTRATION, AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
BOOK WEEK 1981 IN THE BERLIN SUBURB OF MARZAHN.
     
MARZAHN IS ONE OF THE LARGE, NEW URBAN AREAS IN EAST GERMANY. SINCE A NEW
LIBRARY IS NOT YET AVAILABLE, SERVICES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN 4 LIBRARIES IN THE
OLDER PART OF TOWN, A PROCESSING CENTRE AND SEVERAL 'MINILIBRARIES'
ESTABLISHED TEMPORARILY IN YOUTH CLUBS, OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES, HOSPITAL PREMISES
AND ADULT EDUCATION CENTRES. DURING BOOK WEEK, 31 DIFFERENT EVENTS FOR ADULTS
AND CHILDREN WERE ORGANISED, MAINLY IN THE LIBRARIES. THE PROGRAMME INCLUDED
SALE OF BOOKS, GRAPHIC WORKS, CERAMICS AND GLASS, LITERACY DISCUSSIONS AT CLUB
EVENINGS, POETRY RECITALS, QUIZZES AND BAZAARS, WITH THE WELCOME PARTICIPATION
OF 19 DIFFERENT AUTHORS. GOOD PUBLICITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVENTS OF THIS
NATURE.
CHANGING PATTERNS OF INFORMATION USE IN PLANNING.
     
2 STUDIES CONDUCTED OVER A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS REVEALED A NUMBER OF
CONSISTENCIES IN THE USE OF INFORMATION IN PLANNING, BOTH AS FAR AS THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION IS CONCERNED AND THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN UTILISATION OF
EXISTING SOURCES ON THE SUPPLY SIDE. DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THAT
PERIOD REFLECT THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS OF BOTH ADVISORY AND
STATUTORY NATURE. THESE RESULT IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMS-WIDE APPROACH
AND AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF IMPROVED INFORMATION BASES. FURTHER
IMPROVEMENTS ARE STILL DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, NOTABLY IN THE FORM OF IMPROVED
LINKAGES AND CONTINUED DISSEMINATION OF EXPERIENCE WHETHER POSITIVE OR
NEGATIVE.
A RELEVANT LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
LIBRARIES COLLECT, STORE AND DISSEMINATE RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION TO
NATIONAL POPULATIONS. THE TERM 'RELEVANT INFORMATION' IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION
TO THE KENYAN POPULATION. APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE KENYAN POPULATION IS MADE
UP OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND A RELEVANT LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD BE AWARE OF
THE PROBLEMS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO FACE. THE CONTENT OF THE INFORMATION
COMMUNICATED, THE WAY IN WHICH IT IS COMMUNICATED AND THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT
IS COMMUNICATED ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS WHICH NEED TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE
LIBRARY SERVICE IF IT IS TO SUPPLY INFORMATION TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT
MOST. THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS CITED AS A COUNTRY WHERE SOME SUCCESS
HAS BEEN MADE IN OVERCOMING THESE PROBLEMS. MUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS
ACCUMULATED OVER THE YEARS AMONG THE POPULATION AND COULD BE USEFULLY APPLIED
IF IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDED TO THOSE WHO NEED IT.
INFORMATION IMPACT ON THIRD WORLD SOCIETIES.
     
PAPER BASED ON THE TALK DELIVERED AT THE DOCUMENTATION RESEARCH AND TRAINING
CENTRE AT BANGALORE AS PART OF THE DRTC RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM HELD ON 22 MAR 80
AND AT THE 135TH IASLIC STUDY CIRCLE MEETING HELD ON 25 JUNE 81 AT CALCUTTA.
DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE INFORMATION EXPLOSION ON THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND
THE REASONS FOR THEIR INABILITY TO COPE WITH THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY. DISCUSSES SOME SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IN
CERTAIN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND IN PARTICULAR THE RURAL INFORMATION SERVICE
SYSTEM (RISS) IN INDIA.
INFORMATION DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A JOINT SEMINAR OF THE INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION SCIENTISTS
(IRISH BRANCH) AND THE UNIVERSITY AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES SECTION, LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND, DUBLIN, 7 NOV 80. A REVIEW OF THE INCREASE IN THE

THE SELECTION POTENTIAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION, AND THE
'NUCLEAR' ENVIRONMENT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL. THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION COMMUNICATED BETWEEN RESEARCH
SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCH ENGINEERS IN AN R&D LABORATORY SETTING. RESULTS
SUPPORT THE PREMISE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A
SCIENTIST'S 'NUCLEAR' ENVIRONMENT AND HIS SELECTION POTENTIAL AS A SOURCE OF
STI. A MULTIVARIATE MODEL IS DESIGNED FOR USE IN EVALUATING FORMAL AND
INFORMAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS IN THE ORGANISATION.

REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION STRATEGY OF CHINOIN.
     
IN HUNGARY, PHARMACEUTICAL WORKS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR INCOME TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COMPOUNDS. PATENTS MAY ONLY BE ISSUED FOR NEW MATERIALS AND
METHODS, SO INFORMATION ON PATENTS AND SPECIAL LITERATURE MUST BE UP TO DATE.
FOR THIS THE CHINOIN TECHNICAL LIBRARY USES CLASSIC AND MODERN COMPUTERISED
SERVICES. THE LIBRARY SUBSCRIBES TO ONLY 212 JOURNALS, BUT USES DERWENT MANUAL
CARD AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES, AND THE 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 SEARCH SYSTEM.
RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING IS CARRIED OUT MANUALLY THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE,
2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1. IT IS PROPOSED TO COOPERATE DIRECTLY WITH THE COMPUTER
STATION AT THE OFFICE FOR SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DATA BANK, INCLUDING NEW
COMPOUNDS OF CHINOIN REPRESENTS A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WITHIN
THE SYSTEM.
INFORMATION BY, AND RELATIONS OF THE HOSPITAL PHARMACIST WITH THE LIBRARY
INFORMATION NETWORK.
     
HOSPITALS INCREASINGLY DEMAND QUICK AND SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION.
AT THE DISPENSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL OF SZEGED, INFORMATION
REQUESTS IN 1979 WERE ANALYSED. 20% REFERRED TO INDICATION, 11% EACH TO
TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESSIBILITY. &L OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED HIGH
QUALIFICATION, THE OTHER &D RELATED TO ECONOMICS. PHARMACISTS NEED UP-TO-DATE
INFORMATION, BUT HUNGARIAN UNIVERSITY PHARMACIES HAVE NO ON-LINE SYSTEM. IN
ADDITION TO THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL
INFORMATION AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PHARMACY, PHARMACISTS RELY SOLELY ON
THEIR OWN DOCUMENTATION SYSTEMS. A CARD-FILE SYSTEM INCLUDING ABSTRACTS HAS
BEEN DEVELOPED. PHARMACISTS IN SZEGED ALSO USE THE LIBRARIES OF THE MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY AND THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY. AT PRESENT, INFORMATION SUPPLY
MEETS REQUIREMENTS.
INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS AND POSSIBILITIES OF DISPENSING PHARMACISTS.
     
SPECIAL LIBRARIES OF THE HUNGARIAN PHARMACEUTICAL CENTRES ARE PRESENTLY
INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY NETWORK, AND ALL REQUIRE INFORMATION
QUICKLY AND DAILY. DISCUSSES THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION AND THE USE MADE
OF IT, WITH ATTENDANT LANGUAGE PROBLEMS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE SUPPLY OF
MATERIALS WHICH ONLY PARTIALLY SATISFY INFORMATION DEMANDS.
REPORT ON A VISIT TO UVLI IN PRAGUE, 7-12 SEPTEMBER 80.
     
REPORT OF A VISIT TO STUDY LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION ACTIVITIES OF
CZECHOSLOVAKIAN INSTITUTIONS WHICH COLLECT AND PROCESS PHARMACEUTICAL AND
PHARMACOTHERAPEUTICAL LITERATURE, AND TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH REPROGRAPHIC
NETWORKS. UVLI, THE NETWORK CENTRE OF CZECHOSLOVAKIAN MEDICAL LIBRARIES
COLLECTS DOMESTIC LITERATURE AND PROCESSES IT IN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
DESCRIBES THE INSTITUTE OF DRUG CONTROL, THE CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICAL
INSTITUTE, AND THE BIOCHEMICAL AND DRUG RESEARCH INSTITUTE, AND COMPARES THEM
WITH THEIR HUNGARIAN COUNTERPARTS.
DOCUMENTATION OF HUNGARIAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.
     
THE TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE UNITED WORKS OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND DIETETIC
PRODUCTS, HUNGARY, HAS SET UP A SPECIAL COLLECTION THAT RECORDS THE DOCUMENTS
OF THE WORKS' PRODUCTS. THE COLLECTION IS BASED ON THE ENTIRE DOCUMENTATION OF
ORIGINAL HUNGARIAN COMPOUNDS, AND A TITLE BIBLIOGRAPHY COVERING WORLD
LITERATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DRUGS LICENSED IN HUNGARY IS COMPILED BY THE
LIBRARIAN. IN THE COLLECTION ARE USE INSTRUCTIONS, LITERATURE SUMMARIES,
PRODUCT INFORMATION, CHEMICAL SUMMARIES, THE TITLE BIBLIOGRAPHY, ABSTRACTS,
REPORTS ON INVESTIGATIONS, CONTROL CERTIFICATES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS, ALL OF
WHICH ARE RECORDED IN AN ACCESSION-BOOK AND ENTERED IN A PRODUCT AND
SUBJECT-WORD CATALOGUE. MEDICAL REPORTS ON EACH DRUG ARE TRANSLATED INTO
FOREIGN LANGUAGES, DUPLICATED AND SUPPLIED TO THE NATIONAL SZECHENYI LIBRARY
ON COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT. WHILST TRADITIONAL MEANS OF ANSWERING QUERIES HAVE SO
FAR BEEN USED, A COMPUTER WILL HAVE TO BE USED IN THE FUTU RE.
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OF DRUGS USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THE HUNGARIAN
MEDICAL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE.
     
INFORMATION SPECIALISTS MUST BE FULLY AWARE OF DOCTORS' REQUESTS FOR DRUG
INFORMATION. THEY NEED TO KNOW' (1) THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPOUND; (2)
OTHER COMPOUNDS WHICH CAN BE USED IN THE TREATMENT OF THE SAME ILLNESS; AND
(3) THEY NEED CLINICAL/PHARMACOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE TO ASSESS AND COMPARE RESULTS
OF SIMILAR/IDENTICAL CLINICAL EXAMINATIONS. THEY MUST ALSO BE ACQUAINTED WITH
THE IMPORTANT PARAMETERS OF DRUG IDENTITY.
THE IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATION FOR THE UTILISATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL LITERATURE.
     
HUNGARIAN NON-INDUSTRIAL PHARMACEUTICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH
SPECIAL LITERATURE. THEIR LIBRARIES AND BOOK COLLECTIONS BELONG TO THE MEDICAL
LIBRARY NETWORK, BUT THEY ARE THE 'STEPCHILDREN' OF THE NETWORK, AND DO NOT
UTILISE ADVANTAGES TO BE EXPECTED FROM COOPERATION. CONDITIONS IN BUDAPEST ARE
MORE FAVOURABLE THAN ELSEWHERE IN HUNGARY, AS PHARMACISTS CAN VISIT THE
NETWORK CENTRES, THE HUNGARIAN TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE
HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. ELSEWHERE, PHARMACISTS CAN ONLY RELY ON A SMALL
AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE LITERATURE. RECOMMENDS IMPROVEMENTS IN ACQUISITIONS, AND
INTERLIBRARY LOANS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY COOPERATION, AND
DISCUSSES A DATA BANK ESTABLISHED BY THE HUNGARIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
PHARMACEUTICS, WHICH HOLDS INFORMATION ON FOREIGN DRUG COMPOUNDS, THEIR
PRODUCERS, INDICATIONS AND COUNTERINDICATIONS, SIDE-EFFECTS, AND POSSIBLE
HUNGARIAN EQUIVALENTS.

THE COST CONDITIONS AFFECTS THE PREFERENCES, THAT AN INTERACTION EFFECT EXISTS
BETWEEN COST AND SEQUENCE, AND THAT IF COST HAS AN EFFECT ON PREFERENCES, THEN
METAINFORMATION PREFERENCES WILL VARY INVERSELY WITH COST.
STUDY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION IN WASHINGTON STATE.
     
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY USEFUL WAYS BY WHICH
WASHINGTON STATE CAN INCREASE ITS CAPACITY FOR USING TECHNOLOGY IN MEETING THE
NEEDS OF TOP-LEVEL DECISION-MAKERS. THE PROJECT WAS DIVIDED INTO 2 PHASES' A
GENERAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE OVERALL STATUS OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, AND A
SPECIFIC FACTFINDING EFFORT WITHIN EACH SAMPLE AREA CONSISTING OF 9 STATE
AGENCIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
THE CULTURAL APPRAISAL OF EFFORTS TO ALEVIATE INFORMATION INEQUITY.
     
SUGGESTS THAT ACTION TO ALLEVIATE INFORMATION INEQUITY SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THE
PRINCIPLES OF CONTEXTUALISM, INCREMENTALISM, MOTIVATION OF INFORMATION USERS,
AND MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSORPTIVE PROCESS THAT IS UNIQUE TO EACH CULTURAL
GROUP. TO DO THIS, INFORMATION SERVICES SHOULD RECOGNIZE CULTURAL PLURALISM
AND THE NEED TO ELIMINATE INFORMATION POVERTY AS VIEWED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE
GROUPS BEING SERVED.
MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT FOR INFORMATION HANDLING.
     
MENTIONS THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION AS A VITAL NATURAL RESOURCE AND
EMPHASISES THE NEED FOR READY ACCESS TO IT THROUGH VARIOUS WAYS OF INFORMATION
DISSEMINATION. BRINGS OUT THE NEED FOR NATIS. EXPLAINS THE NEED FOR MANPOWER
TRAINING FOR INFORMATION HANDLING AND DESCRIBES THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF
PERSONNEL FOR THIS PURPOSE. GIVES DETAILS OF A FORMAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
PROGRAMME. OUTLINES THE TRAINING PROGRAMME IN INDIA, AND ALSO, BRIEFLY,
PROGRAMMES IN PAKISTAN, BANGLADESH AND IRAN, AS WELL AS UNESCO'S ROLE IN

ACCOMMODATION OF NEW CONCEPTS IN EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES, MISLEADING
TITLES, 'TRASH' LITERATURE, REPETITION, INADEQUATE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL,
COST, TIME LAG, AND LACK OF INFORMATION AWARENESS); AND SUGGESTS MEASURES FOR
OVERCOMING SUCH BARRIERS.
APPLICATION OF AN ENTROPY MEASURE FOR JOURNAL EVALUATION AND ITS COMPARISON TO
OTHER QUANTITATIVE MEASURES.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO). USING A SET OF 856
JOURNALS INDEXED IN 1978 BY 2INDEX MEDICUS1 AND BY THE CITING JOURNAL PACKAGE
OF 2JOURNAL CITATION REPORTS1, A NEW QUANTITATIVE MEASURE HAVING A THEORETICAL
BASIS (ENTROPY MEASURE) WAS TESTED. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF 4
OTHER MEASURES REPRESENTING AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH. ALL 5 SETS OF RESULTS WERE
COMPARED WITH CORE JOURNAL LISTS AND A PEER REVIEW RANKING OF SOME OF THE
TITLES. THE 5 MEASURES SEEMED TO REPRESENT DIFFERENT JOURNAL PROPERTIES. THE
ENTROPY MEASURE INVOLVED THE BRILLOUIN INFORMATION MEASURE (THE CONTRIBUTION
OF A JOURNAL TO THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK RELATED TO A JOURNAL POPULATION).
THE JOURNAL SELECTION PROCESS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE USE OF ANY OF THE 5
MEASURES, EVEN THOUGH THEY PRODUCE VARYING RESULTS.

INFORMATION FLOW AMONG ENGINEERS IN A DESIGN COMPANY.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.) STUDY OF THE WAY
TECHNICAL INFORMATION FLOWS THROUGH FORMAL AND INFORMAL CHANNELS AMONG
ENGINEERS IN A DESIGN COMPANY. ENGINEERS' INFORMATION NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED,
AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR WHILE SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION, OR WHILE OBTAINING IT BY
CHANCE, WAS ANALYSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INFORMATION CHANNELS, BOTH FORMAL
AND INFORMAL, INTERACT IN A COMPLEX WAY, ALTHOUGH FOLLOWING SPECIFIC PATTERNS,
AND THAT THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER DURING THE PROCESS OF INFORMATION
ACQUISITION.
TELECONFERENCED GROUP DECISION MAKING' DESIGNING FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE. (2
PARTS).
     
THIS PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH TRYING TO GET THE BEST OUT OF TELECONFERENCING.

COMMUNICATION SYSTEM TO LINK MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVE AND THE
MILITARY COMMAND AT TIMES OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY WHEN IT MAY BE INOPPORTUNE OR
INADVISABLE TO HAVE ALL THE CONTRIBUTORS TO DECISION MAKING IN 1 PLACE.
NETWORK FILE STORAGE SYSTEM.
     
THE COMMON FILE SYSTEM (CFS) IS A LARGE ON-LINE CENTRALISED STORAGE SYSTEM FOR
THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY'S COMPUTER NETWORK. THE CFS PROVIDES LOS
ALAMOS COMPUTER USERS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE SET OF PRIMITIVES WITH WHICH THEY
CAN STORE AND RETRIEVE FILES. A TREE-STRUCTURED DIRECTORY ALLOWS THE USERS TO
ORGANISE THEIR DATA IN A LOGICAL AND REASONABLE MANNER.
INDEX SYSTEM FOR PERSONAL REFERENCE SOURCES.
     
SEVERAL NORWEGIAN BUSINESS INFORMATION ORGANISATIONS COOPERATED DURING 1974-76
TO DEVELOP A COMPUTERISED REFERENCE SYSTEM (USIS) FOR LINKING ENQUIRERS WITH
PERSONAL, NOT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL, REFERENCE SOURCES. PEOPLE PRODUCE KNOWLEDGE;
THE HUMAN BRAIN IS AN UNSURPASSED 'DATA BASE'; AND PRECISE INFORMATION CAN BE
REQUESTED AND OBTAINED THROUGH CONVERSATION. THE BASIC REFERENCE UNIT CHOSEN
WAS THE SPECIALIST DEPARTMENT OR INSTITUTION, AND IN APR 79 1,200 REFERENCE
SOURCES WERE REGISTERED, REPRESENTING 550 NORWEGIAN INSTITUTIONS. INDEXING OF
SOURCES IS BASED ON ANNUAL REPORTS, CHECKED BY THE INSTITUTIONS. INSTITUTIONS
CAN BE APPROACHED INDIVIDUALLY IF THE PROBLEM REQUIRES PRECISE DEFINITION, OR
THE INDEX USED ALONE VIA A COMPUTER TERMINAL. DATA ON PERSONAL REFERENCE
SOURCES MUST BE CONSTANTLY UPDATED. SIMILAR SYSTEMS EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES,
AND THE IDEA COULD BE EXTENDED' ALL USERS OF COMPUTER TERMINALS (8,000 IN
NORWAY IN 1978, ESTIMATED TO REACH 2 0,000 IN 1985) ARE POTENTIAL CLIENTS.
POSSIBLE DANGERS OF MONOPOLY, ABUSE, OR TAKEOVER BY A FOREIGN POWER SHOULD BE
TECHNICALLY AVOIDABLE.

ASSESSMENT DATA SYSTEMS (EADS), DESIGNED TO AID RESEARCHERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL
ASSESSMENT, EMISSIONS CHARACTERISATION, AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT.
AUTOMATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. JANUARY, 1975-SEPTEMBER, 1981 (CITATIONS FROM
THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
COMMUNITIES DATA BASE).
     
CITATIONS IN THIS BIBLIOGRAPHY COVER THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, METHODOLOGY,
OPERATION, AND VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.
A MICROPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
FEATURES OF A MICROPROCESSOR BASED ARCHITECTURE FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM ARE ILLUSTRATED. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING 3
FUNCTIONAL BLOCKS: THE 'QUERY PROCESSOR', THE 'SIMPLE QUERY EXECUTERS' AND THE
'ANSWER COMPOSER'. THE QUERY PROCESSOR PARSES THE QUERIES AND BREAKS THE
COMPLEX QUERY INTO SIMPLE QUERIES. EACH SIMPLE QUERY EXECUTER IS ABLE TO
PERFORM THE OPERATIONS SATISFYING A SIMPLE QUERY. FINALLY, THE ANSWER COMPOSER
PUTS TOGETHER THE RESULTS OF ALL SIMPLE QUERY EXECUTERS AND PRODUCES THE
RESPONSE TO THE QUERY ORIGINALLY RAISED.
READER EDUCATION IN THE EIGHTIES.
     
REVIEWS SOME FEATURES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF READER EDUCATION IN THE UK AND
USA, AND DISCUSSES THEIR APPLICATION TO THE AUSTRALIAN SITUATION. CONSIDERS'
THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR READER EDUCATION' THE NEEDS AND
EXPECTATIONS OF THE RECIPIENTS; THE RATIONALE FOR READER EDUCATION; ITS
METHODS AND CONTENT; AND THE TIMING AND DURATION OF PROGRAMMES. OUTLINES SOME
POSSIBLE FUTURE TRENDS, WHICH INCLUDE THE SETTING OF MORE REALISTIC AND
RELEVANT OBJECTIVES, AND THE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL METHODS.
REVIEW COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION USE' FINAL REPORT.
     
RESEARCH WAS RECOMMENDED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS' AN UP-TO-DATE SURVEY OF USER
EDUCATION PROGRAMMES IN UK INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION;
CURRENT ACTIVITY OVERSEAS AND INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES, INCLUDING A REPORT ON
THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN THE USA; THE INTEGRATION OF USER EDUCATION WITH
SUBJECT TEACHING; USER EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS; USER EDUCATION FOR THOSE OUTSIDE
THE FORMAL EDUCATION SYSTEM; THE ROLE OF SCHOOLS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
STUDIES; TEACHING LIBRARIANS TO TEACH; EDUCATION IN COMMUNICATION SKILLS;
EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY AND USER EDUCATION; EDUCATION IN THE USE OF ON-LINE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
REFORM AND RENEWAL IN HIGHER EDUCATION' IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
     
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY ORIENTATION FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, 3-4 MAY 79. PAPERS DEAL WITH
A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS, INCLUDING CURRICULUM CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE,
BUDGETS FOR LIBRARY INSTRUCTION, AND PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE
IMPLEMENTATION AND PROMOTION OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
USER EDUCATION' ITS APPLICATIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN MALAYSIA.
     
(MLS THESIS.) A STUDY OF THE FEASIBILITY OF LIBRARY USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES
IN MALAYSIAN UNIVERSITIES ADAPTED FROM UK UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. OUTLINES THE 5
MALAYSIAN UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM AND TEACHING STYLES. LIBRARY USER EDUCATION
MUST BE RELEVANT AND BLEND WITH THE CURRICULUM PATTERNS TO MEET STUDENTS'
NEEDS FOR INFORMATION.
POSSIBILITIES OF LITERATURE SUPPLY FOR THE TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS.
     
WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE ON LITERATURE USAGE, UNIVERSITY-ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WILL
GRADUALLY VANISH. SINCE THESIS PRESENTATION AT A FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY IS
ONLY NECESSARY FOR A PHD, TASKS MUST BE ASSIGNED WHICH REQUIRE A CERTAIN
EXPERTISE IN SPECIAL LITERATURE. 1 OR 2 SESSIONS ARE INADEQUATE TO TEACH THESE
SKILLS, AND LECTURES CAN ONLY BE INFLUENTIAL IF A GOOD LIBRARY IS AVAILABLE TO
STUDENTS. THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY AT SZEGED HAS AN EXCELLENT LIBRARY,
WHEREAS THE BUDAPEST FACULTY HAS NO REAL, UP-TO-DATE LIBRARY. A SOLUTION IS
EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
QUESTION MARKS SURROUNDING THE CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF FOREIGN
PUBLISHED HUNGARICA LITERATURE.
     
DESCRIBES THE CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF FOREIGN PUBLISHED HUNGARICA
LITERATURE IN BOTH HUNGARIAN AND FOREIGN LANGUAGES COMMENCING WITH HUNGARIKA
KULFOLDI FOLYOIRATSZEMLE (HUNGARICA FOREIGN PERIODICALS REVIEW) IN 1970. BOOKS
HAVE ONLY BEEN REGISTERED SINCE 1977. IN ITS PRESENT FORM, BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL UNDERTAKES MORE THAN IT CAN RELIABLY PERFORM. THE FUNCTION OF SUCH
BIBLIOGRAPHY IS NOT CLEAR AND USER DEMANDS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE MET.
JOURNALS IN LIBRARIES.
     
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH JOURNAL COLLECTIONS IN
LIBRARIES. COLLECTIONS WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE, UNSUITABLY STORED AND OFTEN
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE OWING TO INCOMPLETE CATALOGUING. 1 IMPROVEMENT WAS THE
INTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM WHICH WAS EASIER TO STORE AND MEANT THAT ORIGINAL
JOURNAL COPIES COULD BE STORED IN THE ARCHIVES AND NOT DAMAGED BY CONTINUAL
USE. THE ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN LIBRARIANS' COMMISSION FOR JOURNALS HAS
PUBLISHED IMPORTANT MATERIAL DEALING WITH THE BEST WAYS OF STORING AND
CATALOGUING JOURNAL COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATIVE FILMING WITH OTHER LIBRARIES.
AN IMPORTANT AID TO LOCATING JOURNALS IS GERD HAGELWEIDE'S LOCATION CATALOGUE
DEUTSCHE ZEITUNGSBESTANDE IN BIBLIOTHEKEN UND ARCHIVEN (GERMAN JOURNAL
COLLECTIONS IN LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES). THE PUBLICATION OF REGIONAL JOURNAL
CATALOGUES IN WESTPHALIA, BERLIN, HESSE AND WURTEMBERG HAS HELPED TO IMPROVE
LENDING SYSTEMS IN THESE AREAS.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF MICROFORMS' SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVED LOCAL ACCESS.
     
PROVIDING COMPLETE ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS IS MORE THE IDEAL
RATHER THAN THE REALITY FOR MOST LIBRARIES. EVEN WITH PARTIALLY ANALYSED
COLLECTIONS, HOWEVER, LIBRARIES CAN IMPROVE ACCESS AND PUBLICISE THE EXTENT OF
THEIR HOLDINGS THROUGH A NUMBER OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AIDS. THESE AIDS INCLUDE
LABELLING MICROFORM BIBLIOGRAPHIES, PLACING PLASTIC OVERLAYS ON CATALOGUE
CARDS, ANNOTATING SHORT TITLE CATALOGUES, AND COMPILING GUIDEBOOKS TO MAJOR
MICROFORM COLLECTIONS.
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL' A BRITISH VIEW.
     
A FAMILIAR AND CONTINUING PROBLEM IN UK LIBRARIES IS THE UNDERUTILISATION OF
MICROFORM HOLDINGS, BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH IS NOT INTEGRATED IN
THE LIBRARY CATALOGUE. DISCUSSES THIS IN THE LIGHT OF THE APPEARANCE AND
GROWTH OF COOPERATIVE REGIONAL NETWORKS; SUGGESTS THAT THE EMERGING SYSTEM MAY
FORM THE BASE FOR THE MANIPULATION AND SHARING OF FULL MICROFORM ANALYTICS;
AND OFFERS SOME PROVOCATIVE COMMENTS ON RECENT US EFFORTS TOWARD PROVIDING
MICROFORMS WITH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.
SOURCEBOOK OF EXTANT DATA BASES ON DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED CHILDREN UP TO SIX
YEARS OF AGE.
     
A DIRECTORY OF DATA BASES ON DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED CHILDREN UNDER 6 YEARS
OF AGE CONTAINING DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARIES OF DATA BASE FORM AND CONTENT AS WELL
AS INFORMATION ON THEIR ACQUISITION AND RETRIEVAL. IT IDENTIFIES KEY SOURCES
OF DATA AVAILABLE FROM FEDERAL AGENCIES, SELECTED STATES, AND NATIONAL
ORGANISATIONS ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CLIENT AND TARGET POPULATIONS,
SERVICE UTILISATION AND DELIVERY, MEDICAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, AND PROGRAMME
FUNDING AND BUDGETING.
STUDIES FOR A BRITISH REGISTER OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE SCIENCES AND
TECHNOLOGY.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF 3 YEARS STUDY AT SOUTHAMPTON UNIVERSITY. THE ATTITUDES
OF UNIVERSITY RESEARCH WORKERS, GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS, LEARNED SOCIETIES,
CHARITIES, COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY WERE STUDIED BY INTERVIEW, STRUCTURED
SEMINARS AND POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES. CONCLUDES THAT ALL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
WORKERS AND MANY MEMBERS OF ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF ORGANISATION STUDIED NEED
TO MAINTAIN AN UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE OF RESEARCH WORK IN PROGRESS AND THIS IS
TRUE OF ALL DISCIPLINES. A MAJORITY OF THE NEEDS EXPRESSED WOULD BE MET BY THE
PUBLICATION OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY PUBLICATION 2SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH IN BRITISH UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES1 WITH AS WIDE A BASE AS POSSIBLE
OF RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS, WITH MINOR EDITORIAL CHANGES AND A MAJOR
IMPROVEMENT IN PUBLISHING TIME-LAG.
THE COMBINED USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND COCITATION FOR DOCUMENT
RETRIEVAL.
     
A LINKAGE SIMILARITY MEASURE WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
COUPLING OF DOCUMENTS AND THEIR COCITATIONS (BOTH CITED AND CITING PAPERS)
PRODUCED IMPROVED DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL OVER A MEASURE BASED ONLY ON
BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING. THE TEST COLLECTION CONSISTED OF 1,712 PAPERS WHOSE
RELEVANCE TO SPECIFIC QUERIES HAD BEEN JUDGED BY USERS. OVERALL, THE CHANGE
FROM THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING MEASURE TO THE LINKAGE SIMILARITY MEASURE,
REPRESENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF COCITATION DATA, RESULTED IN BETTER RETRIEVAL
PERFORMANCE.
PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION SERVICES ON THE BASIS OF THE DERWENT SYSTEM.
     
OUTLINES THE INFORMATION SERVICES OFFERED TO MEDICAL LIBRARIANS BY THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY-CENTRAL PATENT INDEX, ALERTING BULLETINS, FARMDOC,
BASIC ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, COMPLETE SPECIFICATIONS, INDEX TERM DEFINITIONS,
AND THE CUMULATIVE TRIAL PREPARATIONS LIST.
CLASSIFICATION OF CONNECTORS AND INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS OF AUTOMATIC ABSTRACTING.
     
CONSIDERS HOW TO CREATE AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM OF AUTOMATIC ABSTRACTING IN
WHICH USERS: INQUIRIES CONCERNING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DOCUMENT CONTENTS
(RESULTS OF WORK, METHODOLOGY, EXAMPLES, ETC.) CAN BE ANSWERED. OFFERS A
METHOD OF AUTOMATIC 'QUESTIONNAIRE-ASPECT' ABSTRACTING IN WHICH ASPECTS ARE
REPRESENTED BY 'CONNECTEDNESS INDICATORS' (SUCH AS PARENTHESES, CONJUNCTIONS,
PRONOUNS, AND REITERATIONS) WHICH REFLECT SEMANTIC AND LOGICAL-SEMANTIC LINKS
BETWEEN THE SENTENCES OF A CONNECTED TEXT.
INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN PRIMARY JOURNALS AND SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE
BIOLOGICAL FIELD, PARTS I AND II.
     
AN INTERNATIONAL STUDY WAS INITIATED BY THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF EDITORS OF
BIOLOGICAL PERIODICALS (ELSE) TO DEVELOP STANDARD GUIDELINES FOR ABSTRACTS OF
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL PAPER, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
ABSTRACTS IN PRIMARY JOURNALS AND FACILITATE THEIR USE BY SECONDARY SERVICES.
AS A PRELIMINARY STEP, A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AND
ABSTRACT PRESENTATION AND CONTENT WAS CARRIED OUT ON A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE
OF 240 JOURNALS. DATA ARE PRESENTED ON THE COUNTRY AND LANGUAGE OF
PUBLICATION; AUTHORS' ADDRESSES; BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANNOTATIONS; CATEGORIES AND
TYPES OF PAPERS; INCLUSION OF KEYWORDS; USE OF SUB-HEADINGS; POSITION OF
ABSTRACTS; QUALITY OF ABSTRACTS; LENGTH OF PAPERS AND ABSTRACTS; PROVISION AND
QUALITY OF TRANSLATED ABSTRACTS. IN ADDITION, A SURVEY WAS MADE OF THE
INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS ISSUED BY THE 240 JOURNAL EDITORS, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO INSTRUCTIONS ON WRITING ABSTRACTS.
AN APPROACH TOWARD FUNCTIONAL TEXT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS.
     
A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF TEXTS IS PRESENTED AS A PART OF A SEMANTIC METHOD FOR
REPRESENTING SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS. 4 CONCEPTS OF THEME, METHOD,
RESULT AND DISCUSSION ARE SELECTED AND A MODEL SET OF 'FUNCTIONAL PATTERNS'
CONSISTING OF META-TERMS IN EACH SENTENCE OF THE ABSTRACT IS PREPARED. A
PRELIMINARY COMPUTER EXPERIMENT PRODUCED A PATTERN MATCHING PROCEDURE
IDENTIFYING THE INFORMATION FUNCTION FOR EACH SENTENCE OF THE ABSTRACT BASED
ON THE MODEL SET. THE RESULTS ARE EXAMINED AND DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF
REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE MODEL SET AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROCEDURE FOR THE
OTHER DATA SETS.
REFERENCE MATERIALS IN A TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICE' A MODEL FOR
TELEREFERENCE.
     
PRESENTS A DESCRIPTION OF A TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICE AND THE REFERENCE
MATERIALS USED IN ANSWERING PATRONS' QUERIES. THE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON THE
APPLICATION OF THE EXPERIENCE OF TELEPHONE REFERENCE LIBRARIANS TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS SUCH AS TELEREFERENCE. IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT SELECTION OF INFORMATION SOURCES TO INCLUDE DATA BASES WOULD BE
FACILITATED BY AN EXAMINATION OF REFERENCE MATERIALS CURRENTLY USED IN
READY-REFERENCE SERVICES.
RECOMMENDED LIST INFORMATION SUPPLY IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES-A CONTRIBUTION TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WORK.
     
AT A COLLOQUIUM OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF EAST GERMANY WHICH TOOK PLACE ON
27-28 OCT 76 IN EISENHUTTENSTADT ONE OF THE THEMES WAS THE EFFICIENCY OF
INFORMATION WORK IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE AIMS IN
THIS FIELD. PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD USE THE RECOMMENDED LIST OF REFERENCE
BOOKS AND INFORMATION LITERATURE PUBLISHED BY THE CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AS A BASIS TO IMPROVE THEIR INFORMATION ACTIVITY. THIS LIST
INCLUDES ALL GENERAL REFERENCE LITERATURE SUCH AS ENCYCLOPAEDIAS,
DICTIONARIES, STATUTES, AND THE WORKS OF MARX, ENGELS AND LENIN. IT IS ALSO
IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION MATERIAL UP TO DATE WITH
CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY REPORTS, CONFERENCE REPORTS, AND TERRITORIAL LITERATURE
SUCH AS TOWN GUIDES AND OTHER MAPS. TRADE UNION LITERATURE SHOULD ALSO BE
AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LIBRARIANS SHOULD IMPROVE INFORMATION ACTIVI
TIES TO MEET THE RAISED LEVEL OF USER DEMAND IN THIS FIELD.
THE DIMENSIONS OF THE REFERENCE INTERVIEW.
     
MANY INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES USEFUL IN THE REFERENCE INTERVIEW
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS FOR SURVEY RESEARCH OR
THERAPY. DEVELOPS A CONCEPTUAL BASE FOR ANALYSING INTERVIEWING LITERATURE FOR
ITS USEFULNESS TO THE REFERENCE INTERVIEW BY IDENTIFYING 4 DIMENSIONS OF THE
REFERENCE INTERVIEW' STRUCTURE, COHERENCE, PACE, AND LENGTH. THE FACTORS
AFFECTING EACH DIMENSION ARE DISCUSSED.
THE SERIALS DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR REFERENCE.
     
THE COMPLEXITY OF REFERENCE IN THE SERIALS DEPARTMENT IS DISCUSSED WITH
EXAMPLES FROM A USER ORIENTATION. SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO PROVIDE
GOOD SERIALS SERVICE ARE GIVEN WITH RELATION TO STAFFING THE SERIALS REFERENCE
DESK AND TRAINING PERSONNEL. THE BENEFITS OF IMPROVING SERIALS REFERENCE ARE
DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE BENEFITS DERIVING FROM COOPERATION WITH THE GENERAL
REFERENCE DEPARTMENT.
THE UNION OF THE MUSES.
     
UST'-ILIMSK BEGAN AN EXPERIMENT IN CREATING AESTHETIC EDUCATION CENTRES,
(AEC), IN 30 SCHOOLS IN 1978. AT THESE AEC, CHILDREN PLAYED, HEARD MUSIC,
READ, LOOKED AT PICTURES IN A 3-YEAR AESTHETIC EDUCATION PROGRAMME, INVOLVING
MEETING ARTISTS, MUSICIANS, AND CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS AFTER SCHOOL. THE 1ST
YEAR COMPRISED' MUSICAL EDUCATION, ART, LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE.
THE 2ND YEAR INCLUDED' RUSSIAN FOLK ART, WHERE THE CHILDREN COMPILED STORIES,
LEARNT ABOUT FOLK FESTIVALS AND DANCES, DREW THEIR FAVOURITE HEROES. IN THE
EXPERIMENTAL CLASSES CHILDREN LEARN WELL, ARE MORE CONFIDENT IN CLASS, MORE
ORGANISED AND HAVE A RICHER VOCABULARY. ALL ARE LIBRARY READERS. RESULTS SHOW
THE NEED TO INTRODUCE THIS PROGRAMME TO 1ST-FORMERS IN ALL UST'-ILIMSK
SCHOOLS.
BOOKTALK! BOOKTALKING AND SCHOOL VISITING FOR YOUNG ADULT AUDIENCES.
     
DETAILED GUIDE TO THE PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF BOOKTALKS TO YOUNG ADULT
AUDIENCES, WITH A LARGE SELECTION OF BOOKTALKS INCLUDED.
FILM-SHOWS AND LIBRARIES.
     
FOLLOWING A REQUEST BY HORDALAND COUNTY LIBRARY, DELEGATES FROM THE NORWEGIAN
STATE FILM CENTRE, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS, AND
THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE DISCUSSED FILM-SHOWS AS PART OF LIBRARY SERVICE.
LIBRARIES, LIKE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND CULTURAL COMMITTEES, CAN OBTAIN
PERMISSION FOR FILM-SHOWS, CERTAIN SHORT OR INFORMATIONAL FILMS BEING EXEMPT.
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND AUTHORITY MAY INCLUDE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION,
JOINT SHOWS FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN, USE OF FILM IN FURTHER EDUCATION, AND
SHOWING OF FILMS AND VIDEOTAPES IN LIBRARIES. GOOD CHILDREN'S FILMS ARE IDEAL
FOR LIBRARY SHOWING AND CAN BE LINKED WITH BOOKS. NOT ALL LIBRARY PREMISES ARE
SUITABLE FOR FILM-SHOWS; THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN PLANNING NEW
LIBRARIES. LOAN OF FILMS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY COUNTY LIBRARIES. ALL
LIBRARIES SHOULD HAVE FILM CATALOGUES, POSSIBLY DISTRIBUTED BY THE STATE
LIBRARY OFFICE. THE ASSOCIATION OF CINEMATOGRAPHERS HOPE TO PURCHASE SEVERAL
SETS OF APPARATUS FOR USE IN SELECTED AREAS.
CENTRALISED BOOK DISTRIBUTION-A TOPIC OF THE DAY.
     
A STRONG PLEA FOR ESTABLISHING A NEW, CENTRALISED ENTERPRISE TO SUPPLY
LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WITH LITERATURE AND UP-TO-DATE
EQUIPMENT. ENTERPRISE OF THAT KIND HAD BEEN ENVISAGED ALREADY IN THE STATUTE
FOR THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA. SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS HAVE
BEEN IN OPERATION IN OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. THEY ARE OF INVALUABLE
ASSISTANCE TO LIBRARIANS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE IN SMALL LIBRARIES, WHO VERY
OFTEN LACK THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND WORK ONLY
PART-TIME. BOOKS ARE SELECTED, PURCHASED AND DISTRIBUTED TO LIBRARIES ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED, THE CATALOGUE CARDS WITH
APPROPRIATE ANNOTATIONS BEING DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME. THUS, NEW
ACQUISITIONS ARE SELECTED EXPERTLY TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER RATIO BETWEEN
POLITICAL, FICTIONAL AND SPECIAL MATERIAL. LIBRARIANS ARE BY THESE MEANS
RELIEVED OF THE TEDIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING TASK OF CATALOGUING, AND CAN DEVOTE
MORE TIME TO THEIR READERS, TO THEIR IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION AND TO PROFESSIONAL
ADVANCEMENT.
ACQUISITION AND COMPUTERIZED PROCESSING OF TECHNICAL REPORTS IN THE LIBRARY OF
THE CENTRAL PHYSICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF THE HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
     
IN 1977 THE LIBRARY OF THE CENTRAL PHYSICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF THE
HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES COMPUTERISED THE PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR ITS
COLLECTION OF RESEARCH REPORTS. THE 1ST STAGE IS THE SELECTION OF MATERIAL
RECEIVED; THIS IS FOLLOWED BY CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THE INIS SCHEME.
DATA RECORDING IS CARRIED OUT BY A DIRECT DATA INPUT SYSTEM. VARIOUS OUTPUTS
CAN BE REQUESTED-ACCESSION LISTS, AUTHOR, CLASSIFIED AND REPORT NUMBER
CATALOGUES.
WHAT PRICE INDEPENDENCE.
     
A HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF THE AUTOMATION OF DERBYSHIRE COUNTY LIBRARIES (UK)
SINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION IN 1974. THE ORIGINAL MAINFRAME-BASED
BOOK ORDERING AND CATALOGUING SYSTEM WAS THE SAME READY-MADE SYSTEM USED BY
CHESHIRE COUNTY LIBRARIES. THE PRESENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH
AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS USING A PRIME 550 MINICOMPUTER ON-LINE FOR TECHNICAL
PROCESSES AND SERVICES. DESCRIBES PROBLEMS OF WORKING AS AN INDEPENDENT UNIT.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE FUTURE OF THE RUTGERS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD.
     
REPORT OF A COMMITTEE CONVENED TO EXAMINE ALTERNATIVES AND RECOMMEND
PROCEDURES BY WHICH THE RUTGERS UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WOULD PROVIDE ACCESS TO
THEIR COLLECTIONS, EXAMINING CURRENT PRACTICES FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL, AND
RECOMMENDING ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SYSTEMS THAT WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH AACR2
AND BE EASILY UTILISED BY LIBRARY STAFF AND USERS.
STATISTICS ON HEADINGS IN THE MARC FILE.
     
THE STATISTICS PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HEADINGS IN THE
L.C. MARC 2 FILE AND THE EXPECTED SIZES AND GROWTH RATES OF VARIOUS SUBSETS OF
AUTHORITY FILES. THE INFORMATION IS TO BE USED TO ASSIST IN MAKING DECISIONS
CONCERNING THE CONTENTS OF AUTHORITY FILES FOR DIFFERENT AUTHORITY FILES FOR
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADINGS AND THE FREQUENCY OF UPDATE FOR VARIOUS SUBSETS.
ACQUISITION OF HOMOGENEOUS PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN A SPECIALIST LIBRARY' COST
EFFECTIVENESS.
     
IDENTIFIES THE NEED TO ACQUIRE LITERATURE IN THE INTERACTIVE SUBJECTS OF THE
CENTRAL SUBJECT OF RESEARCH FOCUS IN A RESEARCH ORGANISATION. GIVES A
CRITERION TO IDENTIFY THE INTERACTIVE SUBJECTS AND THE METHODS TO ASSIGN
WEIGHTS TO THESE SUBJECTS RELATIVE TO THE CENTRAL SUBJECT. THESE WEIGHTINGS
DETERMINE THE CUT-OFF POINTS IN THE RANKED LISTS OF THESE SUBJECTS. SUCH A
PROCEDURE WOULD GIVE RISE TO A HOMOGENEOUS, COST EFFECTIVE PERIODICAL
COLLECTION IN A SPECIALISED RESEARCH ORGANISATION.
REVIEWING SLIDES FOR LIBRARY USE.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS A LIBRARIAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SLIDE SERIES
FOR HIS LIBRARY MAY RELY FOR HIS SELECTION ON REVIEWS IN THE PROFESSIONAL
LITERATURE OR ON THE RECOMMENDED COLLECTIONS OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN
LECTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE). THE LIBRARIAN
SHOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE TECHNICAL QUALITY OF THE SLIDE, INCLUDING THE
SHARPNESS OF THE IMAGE AND THE ACCURACY OF THE COLOURS. IN ADDITION HE SHOULD
EXAMINE THE WAY IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN THE SLIDES AND THE
ACCOMPANYING TEXT. A SERIES OF APPARENTLY UNCONNECTED IMAGES LEAVES THE VIEWER
BORED. AT PRESENT TOO MANY SLIDE SERIES ARE OF POOR QUALITY AND LIBRARIANS
MUST BE PREPARED TO COMPLAIN TO MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THIS
SITUATION.
GENERAL CRITERIA APPLIED BY THE VENEZUELAN BANCO DEL LIBRO IN SELECTING BOOKS
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE.
     
THE BANCO DEL LIBRO, A PRIVATE ORGANISATION CONCERNED WITH LIBRARIES AND
EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING, DRAWS UP AND DISTRIBUTES A LIST OF RECOMMENDED
CHILDREN'S BOOKS. DESCRIBES HOW THE SELECTION DEPARTMENT OBTAINS TITLES FOR
SUBMISSION TO THE SELECTION COMMITTEE, AND DISCUSSES THE POINTS CONSIDERED IN
EVALUATION' SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR AGE GROUP; AWARENESS OF SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL REALITIES; THEME AND STYLE; LITERARY QUALITY; VISUAL QUALITY; LAYOUT
AND DESIGN; AND ATTITUDES AND VALUES REPRESENTED. IN CONCLUSION THE
DIFFICULTIES OF PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTING BOOKS IN VENEZUELA ARE BRIEFLY
CONSIDERED.
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY.
     
THIS DETAILED WRITTEN GUIDE OF THE VALDOSTA STATE COLLEGE LIBRARY COORDINATES
THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WITH SPECIFIC TEACHING AND
RESEARCH NEEDS OF THE COLLEGE. IT IDENTIFIES SUBJECT SUBDIVISIONS SUPPORTING
THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENTS, GUIDES DAILY BOOK SELECTION, AND PROVIDES
GUIDANCE IN THE DUPLICATION OF MATERIALS, LOCATION OF MATERIALS, AND
ACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
DEATH AND DYING' A GUIDE TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SOURCES.
     
RECENTLY, A SPATE OF LITERATURE ON DEATH AND DYING HAS RAISED PHILOSOPHICAL,
SOCIAL, MORAL, ETHICAL, AND LEGAL QUESTIONS. PRESENTS AN ANNOTATED
BIBLIOGRAPHY DETAILING SOURCES THROUGH WHICH THIS NEW LITERATURE MAY BE
APPROACHED, SORTED OUT, AND, TO SOME DEGREE, EVALUATED.
TOWARDS A PERIODICAL AND MONOGRAPH PRICE INDEX.
     
EXAMINES THE VARIOUS STEPS AND INTRICACIES INVOLVED IN TAILORING A PERIODICAL
AND MONOGRAPH PRICE INDEX TO A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND LOOKS AT ISSUES
LIBRARIANS ARE WRESTLING WITH IN AN ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THEIR ACQUISITION
BUDGETS. DESCRIBES THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN APPLYING A SIMPLE METHODOLOGY
SUCH AS A PRICE INDEX WHEN A DATA BASE IS NOT GEARED TO ACTIVE
DECISION-MAKING. PRESENTS FINDINGS RELATED TO THE SHIFTING OF FUNDS FROM BOOKS
TO PERIODICALS, THE PRICE-INCREASE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN
TITLES, AND PRICES PAID BY THE LIBRARY AND THOSE ADVERTISED BY PUBLISHERS.
ON THE HANDLING OF DEPOSITORY COPIES.
     
ON 5 DEC 78 THE GERMAN LIBRARY (DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK) HELD A COLLOQUIUM
CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF DEPOSITORY COPIES OF MATERIAL TO LIBRARIES IN WEST
GERMANY. THE LAWS GOVERNING DEPOSITORY COPIES WERE CRITICISED AS BEING TOO
VARIED AND INEXACT, DEMANDS WERE MADE FOR STRICTER LAWS TO COVER ALL TYPES OF
MATERIAL OF VALUE AS DEPOSITORY COPIES. MORE LIBRARY POSTS FOR STAFF DEALING
SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS ASPECT OF LIBRARY WORK SHOULD BE CREATED. MOST
LIBRARIES CONCENTRATE ON COLLECTING CONVENTIONAL FORMS OF PUBLICATIONS AND
TEND TO NEGLECT INNOVATIONS SUCH AS MICROFORMS.
REGIONAL DEPOSITORIES IN PERIL' OR THE FUTURE IS NOW.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. ANALYSES THE INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF KEY
PROVISIONS OF THE 1962 US DEPOSITORY LIBRARY ACT. THE ACT CREATED REGIONAL
DEPOSITORIES AND ASSIGNED TO THEM RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERMANENT RETENTION OF
DEPOSITORY PUBLICATIONS, INTERLIBRARY LOAN AND REFERENCE SERVICES, AND
OVERSEEING THE DISCARDING OF PUBLICATIONS BY SELECTIVE DEPOSITORIES. DISCUSSES
PROBLEMS FACING THE REGIONAL DEPOSITORIES, INCLUDING THE INCREASING NUMBER OF
PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED, LIMITED NUMBER OF STAFF, INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL
SUPPORT, AND THE NEED FOR CONTROLLED GROWTH OF COLLECTIONS. EXAMINES THE
CONCEPT OF REGIONAL SERVICE AND A NATIONAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY AS PROPOSED BY
PROPONENTS OF REVISION OF TITLE 44, 2UNITED STATES CODE1.
UNITED NATIONS DEPOSITORIES' STATUS AND PROSPECTS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. EXPLORES THE VARIETY OF DEPOSITORY ARRANGEMENTS FOR
MATERIALS EMANATING FROM INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONCENTRATING ON
THE UNITED NATIONS PROCEDURES. DISCUSSES THE MERITS AND LIMITATIONS OF
SELECTED DEPOSITORY OPERATIONS AND SURVEYS THE EXPERIENCES OF THE LIBRARIANS
CONCERNED. FOCUSES ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING
THE UNITED NATIONS PROGRAMME.
FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SYSTEMS FOR GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS
IN CANADA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. SUMMARISES THE HISTORY AND OUTLINES THE PRESENT STATE
OF THE CANADIAN FEDERAL DEPOSITORY SYSTEM, FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
LATE 1970S. THE 1978-79 CRISIS, IN WHICH MANY CANADIAN LIBRARIES WERE
THREATENED WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR DEPOSITORY STATUS, GAVE THE LIBRARY
PROFESSION AND THE PUBLIC A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF THE SYSTEM AND ITS
IMPORTANCE. EXAMINES THE PROVINCIAL DEPOSITORY PROGRAMMES.
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. REVIEWS US DEPOSITORY PROGRAMMES FOR STATE AND LOCAL
PUBLICATIONS AND THE INCREASED INTEREST IN MICROFORMS AND THE INPUT OF RECORDS
INTO BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES. FOCUSES ON DISTRIBUTION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL, NOTING THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL STATES TO SUPPORT INTER-STATE
NETWORKING.
PUBLIC ACCESS VIA DEPOSITORY SYSTEM' FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. EXAMINES PUBLIC ACCESS ACROSS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN
THE USA AND NOTES THAT DEPOSITORIES FREQUENTLY DO NOT AFFORD SUCH ACCESS IN A
READY MANNER. ANALYSES THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE DEPOSITORY PROGRAMME AND
MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ITS RESTRUCTURING. THE NEW STRUCTURE IS OFFERED IN
ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MOST FEASIBLE WAY TO ACHIEVE A
NATIONAL POLICY FOR GOVERNMENT INFORMATION, UTILISING MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND
INCORPORATING A NATIONAL DEPOSITORY NETWORK.
FEDERAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. DISCUSSES THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THE US GOVERNMENT
PRINTING OFFICE DEPOSITORY PROGRAMME. EXAMINES THE IMPORTANCE OF NEW
TECHNOLOGIES AND DATA IN COMPUTERISED FORMAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND HEALTH OF THE
PROGRAMME. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE CONVERTING MORE EXTENSIVELY TO MICROFICHE
PUBLICATION, YET THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS 'ON ITS WAY OUT'. THE PROGRAMME
SINCE 1962 AND THE DEPOSITORY LIBRARY ACT HAVE ENCOURAGED COOPERATION AND
IMPROVED DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITIES. DESCRIBES THE ROLE OF THE JOINT
COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND OFFERS SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC ACCESS TO
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.
THE AUSTRALIAN DEPOSITORY LIBRARY SYSTEM FOR GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. AUSTRALIA HAS NO SUCH PROGRAMME, ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT (THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING SERVICE) DEPOSITS
COPIES OF ITS PUBLICATIONS WITH THE STATE LIBRARIES AND OPERATES A 'FREE ISSUE
SCHEME' TO 19 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. EXAMINES THE AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE, THE
VALUE OF A DEPOSITORY PROGRAMME, AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR PROVIDING
PUBLIC ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION.
EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN YUGOSLAV AND SOVIET LIBRARIES AS A FACTOR OF
CULTURAL COOPERATION.
     
THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND OUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN YUGOSLAV NATIONAL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIES IN THE USSR. 8
NATIONAL LIBRARIES PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE
ANALYSED. AMONG THE ASPECTS COVERED WERE' THE SOVIET EXCHANGE PARTNERS,
SUBJECTS OF PUBLICATIONS EXCHANGED (THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE IS THAT OF
LIBRARIANSHIP LITERATURE FOLLOWED BY HISTORIOGRAPHY, ARTS AND PHILOLOGY,
ESPECIALLY SLAVISTICS), AND THE PROPORTION OF EXCHANGES IN RELATION TO THE
PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH IN MOST YUGOSLAV LIBRARIES EXCHANGES ARE CARRIED OUT
SYSTEMATICALLY ACCORDING TO A PLAN AND WITH REGARD TO THE NEEDS OF EACH
LIBRARY, THERE IS A SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY OF COORDINATION ON THE
NATIONAL LEVEL.
NATIONAL INTERLENDING SYSTEMS' A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS AND
POSSIBLE MODELS.
     
THIS WORK EVALUATES CURRENT INTERLENDING PRACTICE AND VARIOUS MODELS OF
INTERLENDING PROVISION AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN UNESCO. IT OUTLINES THE ELEMENTS
NECESSARY IN AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM AND ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY.
FACTORS RELEVANT TO THE DESIGN, AND CRITERIA FOR JUDGING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
INTERLENDING SYSTEMS ARE PRESENTED. CURRENT PRACTICES ARE SUMMARISED AND IN
THE LIGHT OF SUCH INFORMATION, POTENTIAL BASIC AND COMBINED MODELS ARE
SUGGESTED. FACTORS TELLING AGAINST EFFICIENT NATIONAL INTERLENDING SYSTEMS ARE
ENUMERATED AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NATIONAL INTERLENDING SYSTEMS AND
OTHER ELEMENTS REQUIRING NATIONAL POLICY DECISION MAKING ARE IDENTIFIED.

A STUDY OF INTER-LIBRARY LENDING AT THE SUHL DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY.
     
IN THE LAST 3-4 YEARS 5,000 BOOK ORDERS WERE PROCESSED ANNUALLY BY THE SUHL
DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY. THESE INCLUDE ALL THE ORDERS WHICH WERE PLACED AT
OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT. BETWEEN 40%-50% OF ORDERED BOOKS CAN NOW BE
PROVIDED FROM THE LIBRARY STOCK AT THE RESEARCH LIBRARY. THE BOOK STOCK HAS
GROWN FROM 25,000 IN 1961 TO 205,000 IN 1979. IN 1966 A WEEKLY COURIER SERVICE
WAS INTRODUCED TO IMPROVE INTER-LIBRARY LENDING. THE SUHL COURIER SERVICE
OPERATES BETWEEN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF GERMAN CLASSICS, WEIMAR, THE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, JENA AND BACK TO THE RESEARCH LIBRARY. ON AVERAGE 50% OF
BOOKS ORDERED COULD BE SUPPLIED IN UNDER 10 DAYS USING THE COURIER SERVICE.
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES AND INTERLENDING SCHEMES.
     
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES ARE LEADERS IN THE FIELD OF INTERLIBRARY
LENDING IN BULGARIA. A SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN 53 SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
LIBRARIES IN THE PERIOD 1977-79 SHOWED AN INCREASE IN INTERLENDING PARTNERS,
RANGING ON AVERAGE FROM 6-9, BUT SOME LIBRARIES MAINTAINING CONTACTS WITH 14,
20, OR EVEN 27 COUNTERPARTS. INTERNATIONAL INTERLENDING WAS SLIGHTLY UNDER
10%, AND INTERLENDING FROM CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES ONLY 5%. THE GREATEST
DEMAND WAS FOR PERIODICALS, CATALOGUES AND PATENTS, FOLLOWED BY BOOKS AND
TRANSLATIONS. DURING THE SURVEY, LIBRARIANS PUT FORWARD MANY USEFUL
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT, DIRECTED MOST FREQUENTLY AT THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL
LIBRARY AND/OR AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY.
SPEAKING FOR A CINDERELLA' UNPLANNED DECENTRALIZED INTERLENDING.
     
REVISED VERSION OF PART OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON
NATIONAL DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. 4 TYPES OF NATIONAL
INTERLENDING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. MODELS A, B, AND C REPRESENT
PLANNED CENTRALISATION OR DECENTRALISATION. MODEL D IS UNPLANNED
DECENTRALISATION. IT OCCURS FREQUENTLY AND, IF THE TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY
FOR BETTER MODELS ARE LACKING, AN UPGRADED VERSION CAN BE USED. THE COST OF
THE NECESSARY UNION CATALOGUES CAN BE DECREASED BY AUTOMATION. SPEED OF SUPPLY
BY AND GOODWILL OF NET LENDERS CAN BE IMPROVED BY COST RECOVERY. ALTERNATIVE
METHODS OF PAYMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING A SYSTEM BASED ON AN
INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEE FUND.
A PLANNED DECENTRALIZED SOLUTION FOR NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY' THE FEDERAL
REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.
     
EDITED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL
DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. SUPRAREGIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY
IS DECENTRALISED IN WEST GERMANY BECAUSE THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK IS FEDERAL.
COORDINATION OF ACQUISITIONS IS ACHIEVED BY THE DEUTSCHE
FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT, WHICH ORGANISES AND LARGELY FUNDS A COOPERATIVE
PROGRAMME BASED ON SPECIAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES
(SONDERSAMMELGEBIETSBIBLIOTHEKEN). THE 7 REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUES HAVE BEEN
SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL SUBJECT CATALOGUES, THE BERLIN PERIODICALS DATA BASE,
AND OTHER UNION CATALOGUING PROJECTS. INTERLENDING IS BASED ON THE 7 REGIONS,
BUT DIRECT REQUESTING TO THE SPECIAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES HAS INCREASED
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SEARCH FOR FASTER SUPPLY TIMES.
MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF STOCK CONTROL IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE-SCALE RELEGATION OF BOOKS FROM
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. INDICATORS OF USE AND NON-USE ARE DEVELOPED FOR GENERAL
APPLICATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RELEGATION OF PERIODICALS IS CONSIDERABLY
LESS EXPENSIVE BOTH IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT OF EFFORT AND SPACE RELEASED THAN
THE RELEGATION OF MONOGRAPHS. THE RELEVANCE TO A LOCAL LIBRARY SITUATION OF
BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION DATA ON PERIODICAL USAGE IS VINDICATED.
CARING FOR BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS.
     
ADVICE AND GUIDANCE ON THE CARE OF BOOKS, WITH COVERAGE OF THE MATERIALS OF
WHICH BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS ARE MADE, THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF CARE, THE ENEMIES
OF BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS, AND HOW TO CARE FOR BOOKS; A BIBLIOGRAPHY IS APPENDED,
WITH DETAILS ONLY OF GENERAL WORKS-IT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE, BUT LISTS WORKS WHICH
AID IN A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF BOOK CARE.
CONSERVATION IN THE LIBRARY.
     
DURING RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CONCERN OVER THE PHYSICAL
CONDITION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. PAPER IS BRITTLE AND CRUMBLING, BINDINGS ARE
DISINTEGRATING, PRINT IS FADING AND COVERS ARE SOFT AND SPONGY. UNFORTUNATELY
RESTORATION IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING. DISCUSSES THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES
IN THE LIBRARY AND THE MANY AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THE
PROBLEMS. CLAIMS THAT CONSERVATION PROGRAMMES ARE SOMETIMES TREATED WITH
APATHY AND RESISTANCE DUE TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLACING PRIORITIES ON SERVICES.
CONCLUDES THAT RESTORATION WORK IS BEST LEFT TO PROFESSIONAL CONSERVATORS
WHILE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES CAN BE INSTITUTED BY DEDICATED LIBRARIANS.
DEFINITION OF THE NATIONAL DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE.
     
AFTER PROVIDING A GENERAL DEFINITION OF NATIONAL HERITAGE AND NATIONAL
DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE, INTRODUCES THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS WHICH
MAKE UP THE LATTER' WRITTEN DOCUMENTS, BOTH PRINT AND MANUSCRIPT, ICONOGRAPHIC
DOCUMENTS, SOUND, VISUAL AND MACHINE READABLE MATERIAL. IN CONCLUSION, A
DEFINITION-SYNTHESIS OF NATIONAL DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE, IS PROPOSED.
FRENCH LIBRARIES AND THEIR NATIONAL HERITAGE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED BY THE FRENCH HONORARY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF LIBRARIES AT A
LIBRARIANS' STUDY DAY, FEB 80, MARKING HERITAGE YEAR IN FRANCE. CONSIDERS THE
NATURE OF FRANCE'S LIBRARY HERITAGE, AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF THE NOTABLE
BUILDINGS AND INTERIORS WHICH MUST BE INCLUDED WITH FRANCE'S OUTSTANDING
LIBRARY COLLECTIONS OF BOOKS, DOCUMENTS, MAPS, COINS, AND OTHER OBJECTS OF
VALUE. DISCUSSION OF COLLECTIONS COVERS 4 MAIN TOPICS' CONSERVATION,
EXPLOITATION, ENRICHMENT, AND TRANSMISSION. THE LIBRARIAN'S RESPONSIBILITIES
IN RELATION TO EACH ARE CONSIDERED, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE PROBLEMS
OF CONSERVATION. CURRENT PROCEDURES ARE SURVEYED AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY
SUGGESTED, FOCUSING ON BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE ACTIVITIES AND RECENT RESEARCH
ON NEW TECHNIQUES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF EXISTING CATALOGUES AND PROJECTS FOR
FACILITATING EXPLOITATION. IN CONCLUSION THE IMMENSE VALUE OF FRANCE'S LIBRARY
HERITAGE IS EMPHASISED.
THE CONSERVATION OF THE FRENCH DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE.
     
AMONG THE MANY EXPRESSIONS OF THE PAST BROUGHT TO LIGHT DURING HERITAGE YEAR
IN FRANCE (1980), THE BOOK, IN MANUSCRIPT AND PRINT FORMS, IN PUBLIC OR
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS, OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED BY A NATIONAL CONSERVATION POLICY.
ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF PARTIAL INVENTORIES EXIST, SUCH A POLICY CANNOT BE
MAINTAINED AT PRESENT IN FRANCE WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A GENERAL INVENTORY.
APART FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, WHICH HAS SPECIALISED RESTORATION FACILITIES
AND A DEPARTMENT FOR THE PREVENTION AND DETECTION OF DAMAGED DOCUMENTS,
LIBRARIES RARELY HAVE THE MEANS TO ASSURE THE MATERIAL PROTECTION OF
DOCUMENTS. THE PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL HERITAGE SHOULD EXTEND TO THE
SELECTION OF 20TH CENTURY DOCUMENTS.
GOVERNMENT CONCERN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES' SANSKRIT MANUSCRIPT
LIBRARIES IN INDIA, 1858-1937.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON.) DURING THE 19TH CENTURY, THE
INDIAN GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO PRESERVE INDIAN CULTURE. 1 ACTION WAS AN ORDER IN
1858 WHICH HAD 3 PROVISIONS' (1) TO PRINT LISTS OF SANSKRIT MANUSCRIPTS HELD
BY INDIAN LIBRARIES AND MAKE THE LISTS AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE; (2) TO INSTITUTE
SEARCHES FOR MANUSCRIPTS; AND (3) TO ASSIST THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL IN
ITS SANSKRIT PUBLICATION PROGRAMME. INVESTIGATES THE ORDER'S BACKGROUND, THE
RESULTANT EMERGENCE OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES SPECIALISING IN SANSKRIT, AND THE
ATTITUDES OF SUCCESSIVE INDIAN GOVERNMENTS UP TO 1938.
PRESERVATION OF MOVING PICTURES AND SOUND CARRIERS.
     
THE SPECIFIC PROPERTIES OF FILM, VIDEO RECORDINGS, AUDIO TAPES, CASSETTES, AND
DISCS ARE DESCRIBED AND ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO PROBLEMS AND HAZARDS. METHODS OF
STORAGE, CLEANING, USE, AND LONG-TERM PRESERVATION ARE RECOMMENDED AND
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED.
ISSUE CONTROL ON A WRONG TRACK.
     
A CRITICAL REVIEW BY VEJLE LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES' REPORT ON 2AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL, 1ONE OF
THE PROPOSALS FOR STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS ISSUED BY THE BIBLIOTEKSDATA
PARTNERS. THE REVIEW POINTS TO PROBLEMS OF USE OF THE REGISTER OF PERSONAL
CODE NUMBERS. THE SYSTEM WHEREBY CHECK-OUT USES PERSONAL NUMBERS, WHILE THE
RETURN PROCESS USES BOOK NUMBERS, CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR THE READER OF
IDENTIFYING WHICH BOOKS ARE DUE BACK WHEN. DISCUSSES HOW THE SYSTEM DEALS WITH
RENEWALS, FINES, AND RECALLS. USE OF BOOK NUMBERS ONLY FOR RESERVATIONS
AMOUNTS TO A DETERIORATION OF SERVICE, AND THE METHOD WHEREBY INTERLIBRARY
LOANS ARE INCLUDED IS UNCLEAR. ISSUE CONTROL OVER MATERIAL WHICH CANNOT BE
GIVEN A BOOK NUMBER (E.G. PICTURE BOOKS, JIGSAWS) IS EFFECTIVELY ABANDONED. IN
ALL, THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT EACH LOAN CAUSES MAJOR PROBLEMS; IT SHOULD
BE POSSIBLE TO USE THE INFORMATION IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC BASE ALSO IN THE
ISSUE CONTROL REGISTERS.
AUTOMATION AND THE SERVICE ATTITUDES OF ARL CIRCULATION MANAGERS.
     
THE SURVEY AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE DEGREE AND STATE OF AUTOMATION OF THE
CIRCULATION FUNCTION OF 98 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES (MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF
RESEARCH LIBRARIES), CLASSIFIED AS MANUAL, BATCH AND ON-LINE SYSTEMS. THE
OPINIONS OF CIRCULATION MANAGERS REGARDING THEIR ROLES AND ATTITUDES TO THE
SYSTEMS WERE SOUGHT AND THE RESULTS TABULATED.
BATH UNIVERSITY LIBRARY/BURROUGHS MACHINES LTD. AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL
SYSTEM' ITS DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION.
     
(FLA THESIS.) A STUDY OF THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT
BATH UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (UK) WITH BURROUGHS MACHINES LTD. TRACES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT FROM THE INITIAL PLANS, THROUGH DESIGN AND
IMPLEMENTATION TO OPERATION, AND GIVES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
SYSTEM-EQUIPMENT, PROGRAMS, INPUT, OUTPUT AND BACKUP. EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS
ENCOUNTERED DURING THE USE OF THE SYSTEM AND ACTION TAKEN TO REMEDY SOME OF
THESE, WITH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO OTHER PROBLEMS. THESE PROBLEMS LED TO
SUSPENSION OF THE SYSTEM IN 1978 AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY THE SWALCAP SYSTEM
(SOUTH WEST ACADEMIC LIBRARIES COOPERATIVE AUTOMATION PROJECT), WHICH HAS
PROVED RELIABLE AND SATISFACTORY.
DIVERSIFICATION AND MULTI-MEDIA CONTROL' THE LEEDS POLYTECHNIC BECKETT PARK
SITE LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES METHODS USED TO ORGANISE MULTI-MEDIA STOCK IN THE LIBRARY AT THE
BECKETT PARK SITE OF LEEDS POLYTECHNIC. THE COLLEGE ON THIS SITE, ORIGINALLY
THE CITY OF LEEDS COLLEGE OF EDUCATION NOW OFFERS COURSES IN SEVERAL OTHER
SUBJECTS BESIDES EDUCATION. GIVES REASONS WHY THE FULL INTEGRATION OF STOCK
HAS NOT BEEN THOUGHT FEASIBLE OR DESIRABLE. DISCUSSES THE CATALOGUING AND
CLASSIFICATION OF NON BOOK MATERIAL, AND THE TECHNIQUES USED TO DEVELOP AN
INTEGRATED CATALOGUE PROVIDING EASY ACCESS BY FORMAT.
CATALOGUING IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
     
A BRIEF HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF CATALOGUING EAST GERMANY, INCLUDING THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF REGELN FUR DIE ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG (RAK), RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WHERE THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNIFORMITY,
AND THE ADAPTATION OF THE BIBLIOTECNO-BIBLIOGRAFICESKAJA KLASSIFIKACIJA (BBK)
BY ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
CATALOGUES, BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND EARLY PRINTED BOOKS.
     
EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CATALOGUE AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY; DESCRIBES
BRIEFLY SEVERAL LOCALLY-PRODUCED CATALOGUES RECORDING HOLDINGS OF EARLY
PRINTED BOOKS IN VARIOUS NEW ZEALAND INSTITUTIONS, ACKNOWLEDGING THE SPLENDID
EFFORTS OF THE (OFTEN AMATEUR) AUTHORS; AND STRESSES THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL
DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF NEW ZEALAND HOLDINGS OF INCUNABULA.
CATALOGUING MACHINE-READABLE DATA FILES' AN INTRODUCTION.
     
DUE TO LACK OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND UNFAMILIARITY, MACHINE-READABLE DATA
FILES (MRDFS) REMAIN PHANTOM MATERIAL TO BOTH LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY
USERS-EVEN THOUGH MORE AND MORE RESEARCH MATERIALS ARE BEING PRODUCED IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM. REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATUS OF MRDFS; DISCUSSES BASIC
CONDITIONS FOR CATALOGUING MRDFS; EXPLAINS HOW A COMPUTER IS OPERATED AND HOW
MRDFS ARE PRODUCED; AND REVIEWS CHAPTER 9 OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING
RULES (2ND EDITION) WHICH IS DEVOTED TO DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING RULES FOR
MRDFS, FOCUSING ON TROUBLESOME AREAS.
STANDING CONFERENCE ON CENTRAL CATALOGUES.
     
THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE'S COMMITTEE ON CENTRAL CATALOGUES WAS DISBANDED
IN 1980 AND, TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF ITS WORK, A STANDING CONFERENCE ON
CENTRAL CATALOGUES WAS ESTABLISHED, MEETING 3 TIMES A YEAR. WORK CONTINUES ON
TRANSFERRING CENTRAL CATALOGUES TO MICROFICHES, AND THE CATALOGUES OF BAVARIA
AND NORTH-RHINELAND WESTPHALIA ARE BEING ADDED IN 1981. THE STANDARDISATION OF
PROCEDURES FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LOANS HAS BEEN EXAMINED.
ALTERNATIVES FOR FUTURE LIBRARY CATALOGS' A COST MODEL' FINAL REPORT OF THE
LIBRARY CATALOG COST MODEL PROJECT PREPARED FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH
LIBRARIES.
     
UNDER ARL SPONSORSHIP, KING RESEARCH, INC., DEVELOPED A LIBRARY CATALOG COST
MODEL TO ASSIST 72 PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES IN COMPARING THE COST OF
ALTERNATIVE FUTURE FORMS OF CATALOGUE, EMPHASISING THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING
AACR2. 68 LIBRARIES PREPARED INPUTS CHARACTERISING THEIR COSTS AND MODES OF
OPERATION, AND THESE WERE USED, WITH THE MODEL, TO COMPUTE COSTS OF
ALTERNATIVE CATALOGUE FORMS. INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF THE MODEL WERE HIGHLY
VARIABLE. COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING AACR2 WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 4-7% OF THE TOTAL
COST OF DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A CATALOGUE. THE MODEL CAN BE A USEFUL
PLANNING, BUDGETING AND STAFFING TOOL, AND MAY BE SEEN AS A PROTOTYPE,
ADAPTABLE TO PROJECT COSTS OF OTHER LIBRARY OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY
ACQUISITIONS. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR FUTURE MODEL DEVELOPMENT.
THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON THE ROLE OF THE TECHNICAL SERVICES LIBRARIAN OF
ACADEMIA IN THE USA.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF THE IMPACT AND EFFECT OF OCLC AND
AUTOMATED CATALOGUING ON THE PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIAN'S WORKFLOW, AND IN LIBRARY
OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNICAL SERVICE DEPARTMENTS OF US COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES. CONCLUDES THAT THE EMERGENCE OF AUTOMATION AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY
IN THE LIBRARY HAS BROUGHT A KIND OF CAREER AWARENESS TO THE FRONT IN THE
LIBRARY COMMUNITY. ARGUES THAT ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE NOW
OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS GIVEN THEM SOME FREE TIME FROM MANUAL WORK THAT
CAN BE DEVOTED TO THE SETTING FORTH OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
FOR THE FUTURE.
LOMBARDY' THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM FOR COLLECTIVE CATALOGUING AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE REASONS BEHIND THE SUSPENSION OF THE PROJECTED NETWORK IN
LOMBARDY, BEGUN IN 1975 AND DISRUPTED IN 1977. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM DRAWN UP BY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, THE
ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION AND
CATALOGUING CENTRES, AND THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT INTRODUCED. WITH THE CHANGE
OF GOVERNMENT IN 1977, THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED FOR RE-EVALUATION, AND UP TO
1980 NO DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED. THE INHERENT DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE
ANALYSED, TO SHOW HOW THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION MADE A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN
ESTABLISHING A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM WITHOUT OVERHAULING EXISTING SERVICES TO
ENSURE ADEQUATE COOPERATION BETWEEN CATALOGUING CENTRES. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES
OF SUSPENSION WERE INCOMPATABILITY OF THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM CHOSEN WITH MARC,
AND FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN ROUTINE CATALOGUING
ACTIVITIES. EMPH ASISES THE NECESSITY FOR BASIC REORGANISATION OF NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICES PRIOR TO SCHEMES FOR AUTOMATION AND COOPERATION.
THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY CATALOG' COMPUTER-SUPPORTED CATALOGS (IN CHINESE).
     
DESCRIBES HOW A LIBRARY CAN BUILD UP A MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE FILE AND THE
PRODUCTION AND SPECIAL FEATURES OF ON-LINE CATALOGUES.
THE TECHNIQUE OF PARSIFAL. EXPERIMENT WITH ON-LINE CATALOGUE SEARCHING IN
COPENHAGEN CITY LIBRARIES. PART 2' TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF A PILOT PROJECT.
     
FOR PART I 2SEE1 81/5842. DESCRIBES THE EXPERIMENT'S PHASE 0, WHICH RELATES TO
A PILOT PROJECT BASED ON LIMITED DATA AND AN UNALTERED SEARCH SYSTEM' THE
LIBRARY SCHOOL'S SUBJECT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM (BES). THE PHASE HAS THE FOLLOWING
COMPONENTS' 1. TRANSFER OF CATALOGUE ENTRIES FROM KOMMUNEDATA TO RECKU (THE
REGIONAL COMPUTER CENTRE OF COPENHAGEN UNIVERSITY). 2. CHANGE OF FORMAT FROM
THE BC FORMAT (DANMARC) TO THE BES FORMAT; LISTS THE BES SEARCH CODES USED,
WITH AN EXAMPLE. 3. BUILDING UP OF SEARCH REGISTERS, WITH LIST OF TABOO WORDS.
4. DEMONSTRATION RUNS. CONCLUDES THAT PHASE 0 HAS SHOWN THAT DATA COMPILED FOR
USE IN PRINTED CATALOGUES CAN BE USED IN AN ON-LINE SYSTEM. SOME PROBLEMS IN
CONNECTION WITH INPUT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE ITEMS REMAIN. THE SYSTEM ENABLES
SEARCH VIA DK5, AUTHOR AND TITLE LIKE MANUAL CATALOGUES, BUT ALSO TERMS IN THE
TITLE  AND NOTE FIELDS AND OTHER COMBINATIONS. ALTHOUGH SUBJECT SEARCHES WERE
NOT INCLUDED, THE BES PROGRAM MAKES INPUT OF SUBJECT SEARCH WORDS POSSIBLE.
OCLC CENTER DEDICATION AND CELEBRATION.
     
OVER 325 LIBRARIANS AND EDUCATORS ATTENDED THE DEDICATION OF OCLC'S NEW CENTER
IN DUBLIN, OHIO, 22 SEPT 81. WILLIAM J. WELSH, DEPUTY LIBRARIAN, LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS, CITED OCLC'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND INNOVATIONS DURING ITS 14-YEAR
HISTORY, AND DR. LEWIS C. BRANSCOMB, OF OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, DESCRIBED
EVENTS LEADING UP TO AND FOLLOWING THE CREATION OF OCLC.
REPORT OF THE CATALOGING ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING.
     
DISCUSSES A MEETING OF THE ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC) CATALOGING
ADVISORY COMMITTEE, 15-16 OCT 81. THE AGENDA INCLUDED' THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
ENHANCE FUNCTION; BIBLIOGRAPHIC INPUT STANDARDS; A REPORT ON PREVIOUS
RECOMMENDATIONS; DEFINITION OF UNIQUE RECORDS; A REPORT ON OCLC/EUROPE; AND A
REPORT ON DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND TRAINING MATERIALS.
ANOTHER LOOK AT OCLC'S POTENTIAL FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES.
     
THE ISSUE OF OCLC BENEFITS FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES IS DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF
'FIND RATES'. A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE REVEALED THAT 21% OF A SPECIAL
COLLECTION'S HOLDINGS WERE IN THE OCLC DATA BASE AND WERE SCATTERED AMONG 95
LIBRARIES. THIS LOW FIND RATE IS USEFUL FOR DOCUMENTING THE UNIQUENESS OF THE
SPECIAL COLLECTION AND THE LACK OF EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL FOR SUCH
MATERIAL. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT SPECIAL LIBRARIES CONSIDER OCLC
PARTICIPATION WHEN FIND RATES ARE LOW BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS OTHER THAN COST
SAVINGS FOR TECHNICAL SERVICES.
ONLINE RESOURCE SHARING 2. A COMPARISON OF' OCLC INCORPORATED. RESEARCH
LIBRARIES INFORMATION NETWORK, AND WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK.
     
THIS COMPARATIVE STUDY OF 3 MAJOR ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS IS DESIGNED TO
PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SUCH SYSTEMS UPON THE OPERATIONS OF THEIR LIBRARIES.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PATRON USE OF AN ONLINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM IN KNOWN ITEM SEARCHING.
     
PATRON USE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS' ON-LINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM WAS
STUDIED BY INTERVIEWING AND OBSERVING SAMPLE PATRONS AT PUBLIC TERMINALS. IT
WAS FOUND THAT 56% OF THE 'ORIGINAL KNOWN-ITEM SEARCHES' (SEARCHES IN WHICH
THE USER HAD NOT OBTAINED ANY INFORMATION FROM THE CARD CATALOGUE) WERE
SUCCESSFUL-WITH 16% FAILING AS A RESULT OF ERROR IN USE-AND THAT 86% OF THE
'LOCATION SEARCHES' (SEARCHES IN WHICH THE USER HAD OBTAINED THE CALL NUMBER
OF THE ITEM FROM THE CARD CATALOGUE AND WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOCATION) WERE
SUCCESSFUL-WITH 8% FAILING AS A RESULT OF ERROR IN USE.
SERIALS CATALOGUING AND AACR 2' AN INTRODUCTION.
     
AACR 2 IS A SET OF RULES WHICH MEETS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DESCRIPTION AND PROVIDES UNIFORMITY FOR MACHINE PROCESSING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS. THE PARIS PRINCIPLES OF UNIFORMITY OF DESCRIPTION FOR ALL TYPES OF
MATERIALS AND GENERAL RULES FOR CHOICE AND FORM OF ENTRY AND HEADINGS ARE THE
GUIDELINES OF AACR 2. IT IS ALSO BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK OF ISBD (G) FOR DATA
ELEMENTS AND ORDER. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF
AACR 2 AND SERIALS CATALOGUING ARE DISCUSSED. SOME EXAMPLES ARE INCLUDED TO
ILLUSTRATE THE APPLICATION OF AACR 2 IN SERIALS CATALOGUING. PRE-AACR 2
CATALOGUING EXAMPLES ARE ALSO INCLUDED FOR COMPARISON.
ABOUT PERIODICALS AND THE VARIED NATURE AND FUNCTION OF THEIR INDEXES,
INVENTORIES OR CATALOGUES.
     
AFTER CONSIDERATION OF MOLINARI'S 2THE ROMAN PERIODICAL PRESS IN THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY, 1INSTANCES CATALOGUES OF PERIODICALS POSSESSED BY A SINGLE
LIBRARY AND MORE THAN ONE LIBRARY. CITES CATALOGUES OF ITALIAN AND FOREIGN
PERIODICALS POSSESSED BY THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES AND DEALING WITH A
SPECIFIED TOPIC. CONCLUDES WITH CATALOGUES OF A CITY OR REGION. A NEED EXISTS
TO RATIONALISE THIS MULTIPLICITY OF SOURCES. THE STATE AND THE CENTRAL
INSTITUTE FOR THE UNION CATALOGUE IN ROME SHOULD PRODUCE A LOCALISED GENERAL
INDEX OF ITALIAN AND FOREIGN PERIODICALS POSSESSED BY THE GREATEST NUMBER OF
ITALIAN LIBRARIES. COORDINATION ON A NATIONAL SCALE SHOULD FOLLOW. PERIODICALS
SHOULD BE TREATED AS ARCHIVES TO PRESERVE ITALIAN POLITICAL, CIVIL, ECONOMIC
AND SPIRITUAL HISTORY.
PERSONAL DOCUMENTATION FOR PROFESSIONALS' MEANS AND METHODS.
     
DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION OF PERSONAL FILES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL PERSON, AND
THE MEANS THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR FILING THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS AND FOR THEIR
RETRIEVAL. COMPARES AND EVALUATES SUCH INSTRUMENTS AS PEEK-A-BOO CARDS AND
COMPUTERISED INDEXES AND DEVOTES ATTENTION TO METHODS OF DOCUMENT
CLASSIFICATION AND INDEXING, AND THESAURUS USE AND DESIGN. EXAMPLES AND CASE
STUDIES ARE GIVEN. OUTLINES THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONAL COMPUTING, MASS
STORAGES AND INFORMATION NETWORKS, INDICATING HOW THESE CHANGES WILL INFLUENCE
THE STYLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL'S PERSONAL WORK.
MODELLING AND EVALUATING EFFECTIVENESS OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WITH
COMBINED RETRIEVAL SCHEME.
     
DISCUSSES A MODEL OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE USE OF A
RETRIEVAL SCHEME WHICH COMBINES DIRECT AND INVERSE RETRIEVAL PRINCIPLES.
DESCRIBES HOW THE INFORMATION PROCESS IS SIMULATED AND EVALUATED IN THE MODEL.
PRESENTS AND ANALYSES SOME EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.
THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION.
     
SEEKS TO PROVIDE A COHERENT ACCOUNT OF THE THEORY OF LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION
FOR LIBRARY STUDENTS. DEALS AT LENGTH WITH CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY E.C.
RICHARDSON, J.D. BROWN, W. HULME, W.C. BERWICK SAYERS AND H.E. BLISS AND OTHER
THEORETICIANS, BUT THE THEORY PUT FORWARD BY S.R. RANGANATHAN PREDOMINATES AND
HIS TERMINOLOGY IS USED. DESCRIBES UDC, DDC, LC, COLON AND BLISS
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES AND LOOKS AT RECENT TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS.
CLASSIFICATION LITERATURE IN INDIA' ANALYSIS AND TREND.
     
AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO ANALYSE THE CLASSIFICATION LITERATURE PRODUCED IN
INDIA FROM 1932-80. SOME OF THE FACETS CONSIDERED ARE' TYPE OF LITERATURE
(PERIODICAL, CONFERENCE/SEMINAR, BOOK, THESIS); PERIODICALS PUBLISHING
CLASSIFICATION LITERATURE; PRODUCTIVE AUTHORS; YEARWISE DISTRIBUTION OF
CLASSIFICATION LITERATURE; AND SUBJECT-WISE ANALYSIS. THE 160 DEPTH SCHEDULES
PRODUCED BY RANGANATHAN AND HIS SCHOOL ARE LISTED IN CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE.
SOME CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN BASED ON THE ANALYSIS.
TECHNIQUES OF CLASSIFICATION IN PSYCHOLOGY I' FACTOR ANALYSIS, FACET ANALYSES,
MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING, LATENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS.
     
CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS ARE QUITE COMMON IN PSYCHOLOGY, AND MANY
CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO THIS SCIENCE. THE
MOST COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUE IN PSYCHOLOGY IS FACTOR ANALYSIS. DESCRIBES THE
UNDERLYING MODEL OF FACTOR ANALYSIS, ITS INDETERMINACY PROBLEMS, MODIFICATIONS
AND EXTENSIONS. ALSO DISCUSSES FACET ANALYSIS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING
(MDS), WHICH CAN BE USED EITHER AS A PRELIMINARY STAGE FOR OTHER
CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES OR AS A CLASSIFICATION METHOD ITSELF. A DISTINCTION
IS MADE BETWEEN METRIC AND NON-METRIC MDS PROCEDURES, AND BETWEEN METHODS FOR
PROXIMITY DATA, DOMINANCE DATA, PROFILE DATA, AND CONJOINT MEASUREMENT DATA.
FINALLY THE MODELS AND APPLICATIONS OF LATENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS ARE
DISCUSSED.
REPORT OF THE RACISM AND SEXISM IN SUBJECT ANALYSIS SUBCOMMITTEE TO THE
RTSD/CCS SUBJECT ANALYSIS COMMITTEE, MIDWINTER 1980.
     
DIRECTED TOWARD THE ERADICATION OF SEXUAL AND RACIAL BIAS IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SYSTEMS, THE SUBCOMMITTEE REPORTS ITS PROGRESS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF AREAS
OF CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AND SUBJECT HEADINGS REQUIRING CHANGE. A POLICY
STATEMENT AND 6 GUIDELINES ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR 3 CATEGORIES OF PROJECTS'
THE NEED FOR CHANGES IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (LC) SUBJECT HEADINGS APPLIED TO
MATERIALS ON A WIDE RANGE OF RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND LIFESTYLE GROUPS; THE
ANALYSIS OF PLACEMENT AND TERMINOLOGY USED TO CLASSIFY WOMEN AND RACIAL AND
ETHNIC MINORITIES IN BOTH LC AND DEWEY SCHEDULES; AND THE COMPILATION OF
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHIES CITING RESEARCH ALREADY DONE IN THE AREA OF SUBJECT
ANALYSIS AND TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO WOMEN AND AFRO-AMERICANS. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CHARTING OF DEWEY USERS IN NORWAY.
     
IN FEB 79 THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO 179 PUBLIC AND
SPECIAL LIBRARIES, ENQUIRING ABOUT THEIR USE OF DEWEY AND/OR ARNESEN
(NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY); EDITIONS USED; SIZE OF COLLECTIONS;
SUBJECT-HEADINGS LISTS USED; INDEXES REQUIRED; SUBJECT AREAS WHERE DEWEY DID
NOT MEET NORWEGIAN REQUIREMENTS; AND ADDITIONAL AIDS DESIRABLE. THE AIM WAS TO
CHART NORWEGIAN USE OF DEWEY AND OBTAIN HELP TOWARDS A NEW EDITION OF ARNESEN
AND IN THE COMMITTEE'S FUTURE WORK. OF 117 LIBRARIES WHICH REPLIED, 77 USED
DEWEY AND/OR ARNESEN, MANY SUPPLEMENTING ARNESEN FROM OTHER SOURCES. SEVERAL
LIBRARIES SPECIFIED PROBLEM FIELDS, ARNESEN BEING FOUND WEAKEST IN CLASSES
300, 700 AND 900. PROPOSALS INCLUDED MICROCARD INDEXES; CURRENT SUBJECT CARD
CATALOGUES; CLASSIFICATION ON PUBLICATION; AND PERIODICAL PUBLICATION WITH
CONTINUING UPDATING. THE SURVEY REVEALED A CLEAR NEED FOR A NEW, EXTENDED
EDITION OF ARNESEN, AND A LIKELY INCREASE IN INTEREST IN DEWEY, THE  STATE
LIBRARY COUNCIL HAVING RECOMMENDED DEWEY AND UDC AS NATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
POLICY.
DEWEY' THE NEGLECTED INTRODUCTION.
     
DEWEY'S INTRODUCTION HAS BEEN DROPPED FROM THE CURRENT 19TH EDITION OF THE
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME. PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGEDLY PHONETIC SPELLING IT
HAS BEEN NEGLECTED. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS INTRODUCTION
SAYS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE SAID ABOUT LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION IT IS
CONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD NOT NOW BE FORGOTTEN. HOWEVER THE FAILURE TO RELATE
THE THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUBJECTS
WITHIN THE SCHEDULES SET THE UNFORTUNATE PATTERN BY WHICH LIBRARY
CLASSIFICATION CAME TO BE DISCUSSED WITH LITTLE OR NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT DEWEY SURVIVES AS THE MOST WIDELY USED
CLASSIFICATION REFLECTS THE PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO RECLASSIFY ANY
ESTABLISHED LIBRARY AND THE LACK OF ANY NEW THINKING IN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT LATER SCHEMES REPRESENT ANY WORTHWHILE ADVANCE ON
DEWEY.
DEWEY IN THE UK' A BRITISH VIEWPOINT.
     
BASED ON A PAPER GIVEN AT THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION MEETING, 3 MAR 81,
UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON (UK). DESCRIBES THE MAIN STRANDS OF DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION DEVELOPMENT TO DATE, THE RESPONSE OF LIBRARIES TO THE USE OF
MORE RECENT EDITIONS, FROM LARGELY THE PUBLIC LIBRARY POINT OF VIEW AND OFFERS
SOME TALKING POINTS CONCERNING POSSIBLE DDC DEVELOPMENT.
RECLASSIFICATION IN A PSYCHIATRIC LIBRARY COLLECTION.
     
DESCRIBES THE SIMPLE METHOD OF RECLASSIFICATION USED BY THE PAYNE WHITNEY
CLINIC LIBRARY (THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY LIBRARY OF THE NEW YORK
HOSPITAL-CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE) WHEN IT CHANGED FROM ITS UNIQUE DIETHELM
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE SYSTEM.
THESAURUS INTEGRATION IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. PART I' COMPARISON OF THESAURI.
     
PART I OF A SERIES OF 3 ARTICLES DIRECTED TOWARDS THE CREATION OF AN
INTEGRATED MULTIINGUAL THESAURUS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. ESTABLISHES CRITERIA
RELEVANT FOR THE COMPARISON OF THESAURI FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THEIR
INTEGRATION AND EXAMINES A NUMBER OF THESAURI IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WITH THIS
GOAL IN MIND. THE COMPARISON CONSIDERS' THE KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE (COVERAGE,
GENERAL DESCRIPTORS; CLASSIFICATION, HIERARCHIES); THE LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE
(TERMS AND DESCRIPTORS, WORD CATEGORIES, CHOICE OF DESCRIPTORS AND THEIR FORM,
RELATIONSHIPS); AND FORMAL FEATURES (TYPOGRAPHY, ADDRESS CODES, SYMBOLS,
ORDERING, SPELLING VARIANTS).
LINGUISTIC SUPPORT IN BUILDING UP MULTI-LINGUAL THESAURI. CHOICE OF
EQUIVALENTS.
     
THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK WHEN COMPILING MULTI-LINGUAL THESAURI IS TO CHOOSE THE
EQUIVALENTS FOR WORDS WHICH ARE PARTIAL SYNONYMS. WITH THIS IN MIND, CONSIDERS
THE MAIN TYPES OF LEXICAL SYSTEMS AND PARADIGMATIC RELATIONS AND GIVES AN
EXAMPLE OF THE SEMANTIC DESCRIPTION OF TERMINAL LEXICAL SYSTEMS IN RUSSIAN AND
ENGLISH.
THE APPLICATION OF A MINICOMPUTER TO THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION.
     
THE USE OF A MINICOMPUTER IN VARIOUS PHASES OF CREATING THE THESAURUS FOR THE
NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION MATERIALS (NICSEM) DATA BASE
IS DESCRIBED. THE MINICOMPUTER IS USED TO COLLECT, EDIT, AND CORRECT CANDIDATE
THESAURUS TERMS. THE USE OF THE MINICOMPUTER EASES THE PROCESS OF GROUPING
TERMS INTO FILES OF SIMILAR CONCEPTS AND FACILITATES THE GENERATION OF
PRODUCTS USEFUL IN VOCABULARY REVIEW AND IN TERM STRUCTURING. SYNDETIC
RELATIONS, INDICATED BY ASSIGNING CODED IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS, ARE ALTERED
EASILY IN THE DESIGN PHASE TO REFLECT RESTRUCTURING REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE
THESAURUS TERMS ARE ALREADY IN MACHINE-READABLE FORM, IT IS SIMPLE TO PREPARE
PRINT PROGRAMMES TO PROVIDE PERMUTED, ALPHABETIC, HIERARCHICAL, AND CHART
FORMATTED TERM DISPLAYS. OVERALL, THE USE OF THE MINICOMPUTER FACILITIES
INITIAL THESAURUS ENTRY DEVELOPMENT BY REDUCING CLERICAL EFFORT, EDITORIAL
STAFF DECISIONS, AND OVERALL PROCESSING TIMES.
RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE AND LOGICAL ORGANISATION OF THE DATA BASE IN AN INTEGRATED
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR CRUDE OIL PROCESSING AND OIL CHEMISTRY.
     
CONSIDERS A DESCRIPTOR LANGUAGE FOR OIL PROCESSING AND OIL CHEMISTRY AND
PRESENTS METHODS OF INDEXING DOCUMENTS USING THIS LANGUAGE. DISCUSSES THE
LOGICAL ORGANISATION OF AN INFORMATION BASE CONTAINING BOTH BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND
NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS BEING USED IN THE
AUTOMATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR THE AZERBAIJAN SOVIET
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC'S MINISTRY OF OIL AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY.
A CASE FOR REPLACING THE 35-MM APERTURE CARD WITH THE 105-MM FICHE.
     
THE APERTURE CARD HAS BEEN IN USE FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS. IT WAS DEVELOPED TO
FACILITATE THE DATA PROCESSING OF ENGINEERING DRAWING INFORMATION. SINCE THE
PRIMARY BUSINESS DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT DURING THE EARLY 50S WAS THE IBM
PUNCHED CARD (OR HOLLERITH CARD), THE APERTURE CARD WAS DESIGNED AROUND THIS
MEDIUM. EXPLORES THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF 105-MM FICHE OVER
APERTURE CARDS FOR ENGINEERING DRAWING INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS WHY
MICROGRAPHIC USERS HAVE TO DEAL WITH 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO PRODUCE
A MICROGRAPHIC RECORD.
COMPARING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF APPLIED PROGRAM PACKAGES OF AUTOMATED
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
DISCUSSES THE CHARACTERISTICS, ADVANTAGES, AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE APPLIED
PROGRAMME PACKAGES ASPID, PEGAS, ASOD, AIDOC, USM, AND USS.
AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION SOURCES ON MICROMEDIA.
     
DISCUSSES PROBLEMS OF AUTOMATING THE SOVIET VINITI SYSTEM CONTAINING DETAILS
OF INFORMATION SOURCES ON MICROMEDIA. THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM WILL BE BASED ON
THE SARATOV MINICOMPUTER.
TEST OF THE EQUIFREQUENT CHARACTER STRING TEXT SEARCH TECHNIQUE.
     
REPORT DESCRIBES THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOFTWARE, BASED ON THE
VARIETY GENERATION METHOD, FOR A SEARCH SYSTEM TO MATCH RETRIEVAL PROFILES
AGAINST DOCUMENT TEXTS IN THE INSPEC DATABASE, AND THE EVALUATION OF THE
SYSTEM RELATIVE TO THAT USED BY INSPEC FOR ITS SDI SERVICE IN TERMS OF
COMPUTER RESOURCES AND COSTS. THE EVALUATION FAVOURS THE VARIETY-GENERATION
METHOD. USING INSPEC'S CHARGING ALGORITHM, ITS COSTS ARE APPROXIMATELY 75% OF
THOSE OF THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM, WHILE THE CENTRAL PROCESSOR TIME IS REDUCED
TO 1/2.
REVIEW OF VARIETY GENERATION TECHNIQUES.
     
THIS REPORT PRESENTS A UNIFIED ACCOUNT AND ASSESSMENT OF RESEARCH SINCE 1971
ON VARIETY GENERATION, AN EXTENSION OF CLASSICAL INFORMATION THEORY. THE TERM
'VARIETY GENERATION' EXPRESSES THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE AVAILABLE IN SELECTING
THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS OR ATTRIBUTES WITH WHICH A TEXT IS DESCRIBED.
THE CHARACTERISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED ARE' (1) SETS OF
VARIABLE-LENGTH CHARACTER STRINGS; (2) NODES USED IN BINARY TREES FOR SEARCH
PURPOSES; (3) PARTITION SETS FOR USE IN DISTRIBUTION SORTING.
ON THE USE OF 'GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE' OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FOR RETRIEVAL OF
INFORMATION ABOUT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
     
THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE OF CHEMICAL COMPOUND BONDS
AS FILTERS WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS AND COMPOUND
CLASSES IS CHECKED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDEXING AND RETRIEVING COMPOUNDS
ACCORDING TO GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE AND SOME FRAGMENTAL CODES IS COMPARED. THE
EASE OF AUTOMATIC CREATION OF GROSS-WEIGHT FORMULAE, THEIR GOOD
DIFFERENTIATING CAPABILITY, AND THEIR EXPEDIENCE WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATION
IN LARGE FILES ARE STRESSED.
IMPROVEMENT OF 'SPRESI' CODE TERMS BY USING THEM IN CALCULATION OF CHEMICAL
PROPERTIES BY STRUCTURAL AND ADDITIVE METHODS.
     
DESCRIBES THE USE OF THE SPRESI FRAGMENTAL CODE FOR THE ISOLATION IN CHEMICAL
COMPOUNDS OF THE STRUCTURE FRAGMENTS WHICH ARE USED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE
PROPERTIES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BY STRUCTURE AND ADDITIVE METHODS.
LEGAL INFORMATION IN THE USA.
     
SINCE THE EARLY 1970S, 2 COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEGAL RESEARCH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN THE USA, LEXIS AND WESTLAW. IN ADDITION, THE US
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS CREATED THE JURIS DATABANK FOR THE USE OF FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES AND THE CONGRESS HAS MADE LEGIS, WHICH WAS COMPILED FOR USE BY ITS
OWN STAFF, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TO OUTSIDE USERS ON A LIMITED BASIS. ALL
STUDENT LAWYERS IN THE US RECEIVE AS PART OF THEIR TRAINING A COURSE ON LEGAL
RESEARCH AND WRITING, INVOLVING THE USE OF TRADITIONAL AND AUTOMATED LIBRARY
SYSTEMS. IN FUTURE, THEREFORE, IT IS LIKELY THAT LAWYERS WILL EXPECT A MORE
COMPREHENSIVE AND UP-TO-DATE SERVICE FROM THEIR LIBRARIES.
A GENERAL MODEL OF QUERY PROCESSING IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
MOST CURRENT DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS REQUIRE THAT USER QUERIES BE SPECIFIED
IN THE FORM OF BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS. ALTHOUGH BOOLEAN QUERIES WORK, THEY HAVE
FLAWS. SOME OF THE ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THESE FLAWS HAVE INVOLVED
'PARTIAL-MATCH' RETRIEVAL OR THE USE OF FUZZY-SUBSET THEORY. RECENTLY, SOME
GENERALISATIONS OF FUZZY-SUBSET THEORY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WOULD ALLOW
THE USER TO SPECIFY QUERIES WITH RELEVANCE WEIGHTS OR THRESHOLDS ATTACHED TO
TERMS. THE VARIOUS QUERY-PROCESSING METHODS ARE DISCUSSED AND COMPARED.
COMPUTER ENUMERATION AND GENERATION OF TREES AND ROOTED TREES.
     
A COMPUTER-ADOPTED METHOD FOR ENUMERATING AND PLOTTING TREES (ALKANES) AND
ROOTED TREES (SUBSTITUTED ALKANES) WITH +N VERTICES (CARBON ATOMS) IS
DESCRIBED. RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO SOME PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS AREA.
THE EMERGING INTERNATIONALISM OF ONLINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
UNTIL 1980 ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND DISSEMINATION SERVICES WERE FOR
THE MOST PART BASED IN THE USA. TODAY, HOWEVER, A VARIETY OF INFORMATION
SERVICES AS WELL AS PACKET-SWITCHED NETWORKS ARE EMERGING IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
ALTHOUGH US DEVELOPED SOFTWARE STILL PREDOMINATES IN OVERALL USE, ACTIVITY IN
EUROPE AND OTHER COUNTRIES IS DEVELOPING RAPIDLY. A RIVALRY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT
SUBSIDISED SERVICES AND COMPETITIVE NONSUBSIDISED SERVICES IS EMERGING. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
APPLICATION OF A COMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSOR IN AN INFORMATION DEPARTMENT.
     
A STAND ALONE WORD PROCESSOR (PHILIPS 5002) IS USED TO PRODUCE AN INFORMATION
BULLETIN. A COPY OF THE DATA IS TRANSMITTED FROM THE WORD PROCESSOR TO A
MAINFRAME COMPUTER WHERE IT IS BATCH ASSIMILATED INTO AN ON-LINE DATA BASE.
THE ON-LINE SYSTEM (DECO-UNILEVER COMPUTER SERVICES LTD.) HAS ALL THE FEATURES
OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INITIATE THE
GENERATION OF PRINTED INDEXES, EITHER TO THE ENTIRE DATA BASE, OR TO A SUBSET
(HIT-SET) OF DATA, DURING AN ON-LINE SESSION. THE VERSATILITY OF THE WORD
PROCESSOR AND ON-LINE SEARCH SYSTEM ARE ILLUSTRATED DESCRIBING THE VARIOUS
STAGES FROM A SINGLE KEYING STEP, THROUGH TO BULLETIN, DATA BASE, AND PRINTED
INDEX PRODUCTION.
ON-LINE, NEW AID IN REFERENCE WORK.
     
REPORTS ON AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ORGANISED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
AND HELD IN SEPT. 81. A NUMBER OF BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE DURING THE
LAST 3 YEARS CARRIED OUT EXPERIMENTS WITH THE USE OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS. RESULTS
OF THESE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S REPORT SERIES AND WERE
DISCUSSED AT THE CONFERENCE. THE QUESTION OF PAYMENT FOR ON-LINE SEARCHES WAS
DEBATED. THE EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WAS OUTLINED, INCLUDING THE ONE
FROM GENTOFTE, DENMARK. IN LUTON CENTRAL LIBRARY, ENGLAND, WHICH FORMERLY
SUBSCRIBED TO ONLY A FEW CONVENTIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES, INSTALLATION OF
ON-LINE FACILITIES HAS LED TO A LARGE EXPANSION. NEW USERS HAVE BEEN
ATTRACTED, THE LIBRARY'S IMAGE IMPROVED, AND THE ENSUING GOOD-WILL HAS BEEN A
USEFUL TOOL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CUTS. THE STAFF HAVE BECOME MORE COST
CONSCIOUS AND HENCE MORE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH USERS, WHO HAVE BEEN MORE
THOROUGHLY INTERVIEWED. MORE TIME IS NOW SPENT PREPARING THE SEARCH STRATEGY.
THE DANGER OF REDUNDANCIES AS A RESULT OF GREATER EFFICIENCY WAS THEREFORE
DISMISSED.
FACT RETRIEVAL FOR THE 1980S.
     
REVIEWS PREVAILING METHODOLOGIES OF FACT RETRIEVAL IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AND MAKES PROJECTIONS FOR THE DECADE TO COME' NUMERIC DATA BASES ARE SHOWN TO
OVERTAKE IN SIZE AND NUMBER THE LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS. THIS IS
EXPECTED TO LEAD TOWARD MORE SOPHISTICATED, INTERACTIVE DATA ANALYSIS
TECHNIQUES WITH GRAPHICAL DISPLAY OPTIONS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW-COST
INTELLIGENT COMPUTER TERMINALS, MICRO- AND MINICOMPUTERS, IS SHOWN TO MAKE
AGGREGATION AND POST-PROCESSING OF RETRIEVED INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT
SOURCES READILY POSSIBLE. THIS CAPABILITY MAY COME INTO CONFLICT WITH LEGAL
CONSTRAINTS AND IS BOUND TO AFFECT THE TRADITIONAL MARKETING OF INFORMATION.
IT WILL LEAD TO THE EXTRACTION OF HIGHER FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE FROM TEXT AND
DATA. THE USER COMMUNITY IS SEEN TO SHIFT FROM EXPERT INFORMATION SPECIALISTS,
WHO ACT NOW AS MIDDLEMEN, TO THE END-USERS OF INFORMATION. THIS LESS
EXPERIENCED USER COMMUNITY WILL CHALLENGE THE INGENUITY OF SYSTEM DESIGNERS
FOR SELF-GUIDING, ADAPTIVE, AND YET MORE SOPHISTICATED MAN-MACHINE INTERFACES.
THE MERGING OF WIDE-BAND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS WITH COMPUTER
TECHNOLOGIES WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INTERCONNECT COMPUTERS, INFORMATION
CENTRES, WORD PROCESSORS, AND OTHER PERIPHERALS, WORLDWIDE.
SOME RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION ACTIVITIES IN JAPAN.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENTS IN ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICES, PROVISION OF
PRIMARY DOCUMENTS, INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE INPUT OF JAPANESE
LITERATURE INTO DATA BASES, AND THE PRODUCTION OF JAPANESE DATA BASES. IT ALSO
DISCUSSES THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES.
THE CURRENT ONLINE SITUATION IN JAPAN.
     
THE CURRENT SITUATION IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS IN JAPAN IS REVIEWED. ON TOP OF THE
NORNAL PROBLEMS IN ACCEPTING ONLINE SERVICES, JAPANESE PEOPLE ENCOUNTER
DIFFICULTIES IN OVERCOMING LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. THESE ARE
ESPECIALLY HEAVY IN THE CREATION OF DATA BASES OF JAPANESE ORIGIN. THE PRESENT
STATE OF COMMUNICATION NETWORKS IN JAPAN IS DESCRIBED. FINALLY, THE
TRANSFORMATION OF BOOKSELLERS TO FULL-SERVICE INFORMATION SUPPLIERS IS
HIGHLIGHTED.
USE OF ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LIBRARIES. A REPORT TO THE COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES ON A FELLOWSHIP
PROJECT, 1977.
     
EXAMINES THE USE OF ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS IN A SELECTED
NUMBER OF SCIENCE AND TECHOLOGY LIBRARIES CHOSEN FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP
REPUTATION. IT IS LIMITED TO THE USE OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS OPERATED BY A LIBRARY
STAFF MEMBER. THE FOLLOWING ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED' PROBLEMS OF INITIATION AND
ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING PROCUREMENT, EQUIPMENT, ACCOUNTING AND
CENTRALISATION; PUBLICITY AND USER EDUCATION; CHARGES; ANALYST TRAINING AND
BACKGROUND. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

ORGANISATION, FINANCIAL SUPPORT, COSTING AND COSTS; AND DATA, WITH TABLES AND
A FULL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
INTERACTIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ON TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY OF MINERALS
PROCESSING.
     
DEMONSTRATES THE NECESSITY OF AN INTERACTIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM TO EVALUATE THE
PRESENT STATE OF AND TO FORECAST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGIES AND
TECHNIQUES OF RAW MINERAL PROCESSING. DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF A SYSTEM
PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS OF INFORMATION STORAGE, RETRIEVAL, UP-DATING,
GROUPING, AND OUTPUT.
AN ONLINE INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR AGGREGATE STATE AND LOCAL AREA ECONOMIC DATA.
     
DESCRIBES THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE KENTUCKY ECONOMIC INFORMATION
SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM, WHICH IS THE 1ST OF ITS TYPE, IS A PUBLIC COMPUTER-BASED
DATA STORAGE, RETRIEVAL, DISPLAY, AND ANALYSIS FACILITY THAT HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO MAKE AGGREGATE ECONOMIC DATA PERTAINING PRIMARILY TO THE
STATE OF KENTUCKY READILY AVAILABLE TO AND EASILY USABLE BY A WIDE VARIETY OF
PEOPLE. THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY RESIDENT ON 2 SEPARATE COMPUTER NETWORKS AND
IS ACCESSIBLE VIA A TELECOMMUNICATIONS TERMINAL OVER AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE
LINE, AS WELL AS THROUGH LOCAL MODES OF ACCESS.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF DATA NETWORK DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OECD AREA.
     
PROCEEDINGS OF A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE ICCP WORKING PARTY, PARIS, 13-15 SEPT
78. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE MEETING WERE TO CONSTITUTE A FORUM FOR PRESENTATION
OF PLANS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILD-UP OF DATA NETWORKS IN MEMBER
COUNTRIES; DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONAL ISSUES; CONSIDERATION OF THE NEED FOR
OECD-WIDE DATA NETWORK POLICIES; AND IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC PROBLEMS FOR
THE SOLUTION OF WHICH THE OECD MAY BE THE PROPER SETTING.
COMMUNICATIONS IN THE NEW 'MEDIA' (IN SPANISH).
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION MEDIA IS DISCUSSED WITH
REFERENCE TO BROADCAST VIDEOTEXT (TELETEXT), INTERACTIVE VIDEOTEXT (VIEWDATA),
AND INTERACTIVE VIDEOTEXT VIA CABLE. THE TYPES OF SERVICES AVAILABLE VIA THESE
SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED.
THE HOME OFFICE' VIDEOTEX AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS FOR OFFICE AUTOMATION.
     
THE USA AND EUROPE HAVE SHIFTED FROM INDUSTRIAL TO INFORMATION ECONOMIES. THIS
HAS HAD CONSEQUENCES FOR OFFICE ACTIVITIES, THE PROLIFERATION OF JOURNALS AND
WORK PATTERNS. EXPLORES THE CONCEPT OF THE REMOTE OFFICE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
ADVENT OF PERSONAL COMPUTING AND MASS CONSUMER COMPUTING (ESPECIALLY
VIDEOTEX). DETAILED ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO VIDEOTEX APPLICATIONS AND THE USE OF
PERSONAL COMPUTERS AS MULTIFUNCTION WORKSTATIONS.
DISPLAY OF TEXT ON TELEVISION.
     
A VIDEOTEX SERVICE WHEREBY THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS VARIOUS
KINDS OF INFORMATION FROM CENTRAL DATA BASES DISPLAYS TEXTUAL AND GRAPHICAL
INFORMATION ON TELEVISION RECEIVERS. TECHNICAL AND GRAPHIC DESIGN PROBLEMS
RELATED TO THE DISPLAY OF SUCH INFORMATION ON A COLOUR TELEVISION ARE
ADDRESSED. THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL STUDIES CONCERNED WITH THE DISPLAY OF TEXT
ARE DESCRIBED, AND THE RELATIVE MERITS OF RED-GREEN-BLUE VERSUS COMPOSITE
VIDEO INPUT ARE DISCUSSED.
VIDEOTEX: WRIT LARGE OR SMALL?.
     
A SURVEY OF VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS BEING DEVELOPED AROUND THE WORLD, CONCENTRATING
ON THE UK'S PRESTEL AND CANADA'S TELIDON, IN ADDITION TO THE GATEWAY FACILITY
FROM WEST GERMANY'S BILDSCHIRMTEXT, WHICH HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY PRESTEL. SHOWS
HOW PRESTEL HAS FALLEN SHORT OF ITS TARGET FOR SUBSCRIBERS.
INTELLIGENT ACCESS TO PRESTEL.
     
THE FACILITIES OF PRESTEL, THE UK POST OFFICE VIEWDATA SERVICE, ARE OUTLINED,
EMPHASISING THE ASPECTS OF ITS DESIGN WHICH MAKE IT VERY EASY TO USE. THE VERY
SIMPLE STRUCTURE OF THE DATA IS ALSO DISCUSSED AND COMPARED WITH OTHER
VIEWDATA SYSTEMS. NORMAL PRESTEL TERMINALS HAVE LIMITED CAPABILITIES BUT
INTELLIGENT TERMINALS ARE BEING DEVELOPED WHICH WILL ALLOW TELESOFTWARE TO BE
USED FOR PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION. AN EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF SUCH PROGRAMS IS TO
IMPROVE THE METHOD OF ACCESS TO SPECIFIC DATA. SOME EXAMPLES ARE DESCRIBED
WITH EMPHASIS ON THE NEED TO RETAIN THE UNDERLYING SIMPLICITY WHEN ADDING NEW
CAPABILITIES.
PRESTEL GATEWAY TO THIRD PARTY DATA BASES.
     
THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE PRESENTED' NETWORKING IN THE GERMAN BILDSCHIRMTEXT
SYSTEM, BY L. GRIEBL; THE BILDSCHIRMTEXT GATEWAY FACILITY-HOW DOES IT WORK?,
BY D. GILBERT AND I. TAYLOR; ON-LINE BANKING SERVICES USING BILDSCHIRMTEXT, BY
P. KOHN; IMPLEMENTATION OF 3RD PARTY DATA BASE SYSTEMS IN THE UK, BY K.E.
CLARKE AND S.J. WILDERS; PRESTEL GATEWAY-THE COMMERCIAL ASPECTS, BY I.G.
CHISHOLM; THE BUSINESS OPTIONS FOR CONNECTING TO PRESTEL GATEWAY, BY A.R.
HAINES.
BUZBY SWOOPS TO CONQUER.
     
THE UK POST OFFICE'S PRESTEL SYSTEM IS EXPLAINED AND BRIEF DETAILS ARE GIVEN
OF ITS OPERATION AND THE SERVICE IT PROVIDES. A DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN OF
TELETEXT AND THE WAYS IN WHICH IT DIFFERS FROM VIEWDATA AND A BREAKDOWN OF THE
COST OF PRESTEL AND THE RANGE OF INFORMATION IT OFFERS ARE CONSIDERED. THE 2
TYPES OF PRESTEL TERMINALS, I.E. BUSINESS OR DOMESTIC SETS, ARE DESCRIBED. A
SURVEY OF MANUFACTURERS OF ADAPTORS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN PRESTEL ON A
HOME TELEVISION SET, IS PRESENTED AND FINALLY, CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO
PRESTEL'S FUTURE AND GATEWAY, WHEREBY A PRESTEL USER CAN GAIN ACCESS TO A 3RD
PARTY DATA BASE, PARTICULARLY IN THE TRAVEL, MAIL ORDER AND BANKING SECTORS.
VIEWDATA.
     
3 PAPERS ARE INCLUDED: A RACE FOR STAYERS? (J. HORSLEY) PROVIDES A SURVEY OF
PRIVATE VIEWDATA; GATEWAY TO PRESTEL'S FUTURE? (E. BIRD) EXPLAINS THE
RELEVANCE OF GATEWAY TO DATA PROCESSING MANAGEMENT; WEST GERMAN EXPERIMENT
BRINGS PUBLIC ON-LINE (D. GILBERT) DESCRIBES THE GERMANS' USE OF GATEWAY
CONNECTIONS.
THE APPLICATION OF PICTURE CODING TECHNIQUES TO VIEWDATA.
     
A TECHNIQUE FOR INCLUDING COLOUR PICTURES IN A VIEWDATA PAGE HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED BY THE POST OFFICE RESEARCH CENTRE. THE NEED FOR IMPROVED GRAPHICS
IS EXPLAINED. THE METHOD OF PICTURE CODING IS OUTLINED INCLUDING SOME
TECHNICAL DETAIL, HARDWARE NEEDED AND COSTS INVOLVED. EXAMPLES OF APPLICATIONS
ARE GIVEN INCLUDING MAIL ORDER, ADVERTISING, PORTRAITS, SECURITY SYSTEMS AND
EDUCATION.
A DESCRIPTION OF THE BROADCAST TELIDON SYSTEM.
     
THE DATA FORMAT WHICH HAS BEEN ADOPTED FOR THE TELIDON SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED.
THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ARE LISTED FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE
STRUCTURE USED TO TRANSMIT DATA SUCH THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. THE
ALPHA-GEOMETRIC CODING ALLOWS DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY AND RESOLUTION TO BE
INDEPENDENT OF THE CODES.
COMPARATIVE TERMINAL REALIZATIONS WITH ALPHA-GEOMETRIC CODING.
     
IT IS CONSIDERED DESIRABLE THAT A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF
TRANSMITTING BOTH HIGH AND LOW QUALITY GRAPHICS AND TERMINALS SHOULD BE ABLE
TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE FROM EITHER TYPE OF SIGNAL ACCORDING TO THE TERMINAL
DESIGN. SYSTEMS CONFIGURATIONS ARE SHOWN TO ILLUSTRATE TERMINALS OF VARIOUS
LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION. IT IS THOUGHT THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE COST
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF SOPHISTICATION WILL NOT BE GREAT. REFERENCE
IS MADE TO THE CAPABILITIES OF TELIDON SOFTWARE FLEXIBILITY.
ENHANCED UK TELETEXT MOVES TOWARDS STILL PICTURES.
     
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CEEFAX SYSTEM IS GIVEN ALONG WITH CURRENT WORK TO
IMPROVE THE SERVICE. AREAS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO NEED IMPROVEMENT ARE
ACCESS, CHARACTER REPERTOIRE AND PICTURES.
TELETEXT SYSTEMS ARE APPROACHING WITH CAUTION.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE TELETEXT COMMITTEE, SET UP IN 1978 BY THE PRIME
MINISTER'S OFFICE TO EXAMINE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR
INTRODUCING 1 OR MORE TELETEXT SYSTEMS IN DENMARK AND TO EVALUATE THE COSTS
INVOLVED. THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THE INTRODUCTION OF TEXT-TV, WHICH IS REGARDED
AS A USEFUL AND CHEAP MEANS OF TEXTING TV PROGRAMMES AND DISTRIBUTING GENERAL
INFORMATION. TELEDATA'S DIRECT CONNECTION TO DATA BASES WITH UNLIMITED
INFORMATION MAKES IT ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR INFORMATION SEARCHES. IT CAN ALSO
BE USED BY LIBRARIES FOR LOCATION OF BOOKS, LOAN INFORMATION, AND READERS'
ADVICE. OTHER USES INCLUDE' UPDATING OF REFERENCE WORKS AND ALL SOCIAL
INFORMATION OF A CHANGING NATURE' TIMETABLES, ADDRESS LISTS, ETC. HOWEVER,
TELEDATA IS VERY COSTLY AND DEMANDS A HIGH DEGREE OF ADAPTABILITY BY USERS.
ITS INTRODUCTION AS A PERMANENT PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD THEREFORE AWAIT THE
RESULTS OF THE PLANNED EXPERIMENT EXPECTED IN 1983 AND SHO ULD ALSO BE
DISCUSSED BY THE MEDIA COMMISSION.
TELETEXT IN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE (IN GERMAN).
     
DESCRIBES A 25 MONTH TELETEXT EXPERIMENT BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE SWISS RADIO
AND TV COMPANY AND THE SWISS ASSOCIATION OF NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE PUBLISHERS,
WHICH COMPRISES 10 MAJOR SWISS PUBLISHING COMPANIES. IN THE EXPERIMENT, A
'TELEVISED NEWSPAPER' IS BROADCAST TO THE GERMAN-SPEAKING AREAS OF
SWITZERLAND. LOOKS AT COSTS OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE, THE NEED FOR A WORLDWIDE
STANDARD AND THE WAY TELETEXT SYSTEMS FUNCTION.
TELESOFTWARE-VALUE ADDED TELETEXT.
     
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HOME MICROCOMPUTER TO A LARGE POPULATION IS DISCUSSED.
THE NEED TO MAKE IT CHEAP, EASY TO BUY AND OPERATE AND PROVIDE THE CORRECT
SERVICE IS EMPHASISED. USING THE TELEVISION AND THE TELETEXT SYSTEM, A METHOD
OF PROVIDING COMPUTING POWER IN THE HOME IS DESCRIBED. THE HARDWARE NECESSARY,
DESIGN OF PROGRAMMES AND HOW THE ORACLE SOFTWARE MAY BE USED ARE CONSIDERED.
THE FACTFINDER INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
FACTFINDER IS A MINICOMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION HANDLING PACKAGE DEVELOPED ON
THE BASIS OF TOTAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. WITHIN THE SYSTEM THE CONCEPTS OF
TEXT PROCESSING AND WORD PROCESSING ARE UNITED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT
OF INFORMATION AT EVERY STAGE. THUS, FACTFINDER COMBINES FLEXIBLE DATA INPUT
FACILITIES WITH A POWERFUL RETRIEVAL CAPABILITY, ENHANCED BY THE INCLUSION OF
EFFICIENT EDITING AND REPORTING FUNCTIONS. FACTFINDER IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED
FOR INTERACTIVE USE IN A MULTI-USER ENVIRONMENT. INPUT IS USER-DEFINED AND MAY
BE FREE TEXT OR FORMATTED. EDITING AND RETRIEVAL ARE ALSO ON-LINE PROCEDURES
AND DUE TO FACTFINDER'S EFFICIENT BACKGROUND PROCESSING FACILITY, THE UPDATING
AND PRINTING FUNCTIONS MAY RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THESE ON-LINE TERMINAL
ACTIVITIES. ANY BATCH ROUTINES ARE ALSO INITIATED AT THE TERMINALS ALTHOUGH
THESE ARE FEW AND OF A UTILITY OR SECURITY NATURE. FACTFINDER IS BASED ON THE
SWEDISH IMDOC SYSTEM AND IS M ARKETED BY MCS MINI-COMPUTER SYSTEMS LTD. THE
SOFTWARE IS WRITTEN IN EXTENSIVE BASIC AND THE SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE AS A
COMPLETE PACKAGE OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE BASED ON THE DATA GENERAL RANGE OF
MINICOMPUTERS. BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY MINI-COMPUTER
SYSTEMS LTD.
CAIRS-A COMPUTER ASSISTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
A FLEXIBLE LOW COST MINICOMPUTER BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS
DESCRIBED. CAIRS (COMPUTER ASSISTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM) ALLOWS
INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF DOCUMENTS, TEXT, RECORDS OR ABSTRACTS TO BE STORED
IN A COMPUTER DATA BASE. THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN RTL2, A HIGH LEVEL
TRANSPORTABLE COMPUTER LANGUAGE, WHICH ALLOWS CAIRS TO RUN ON MOST POPULAR
MINICOMPUTERS. DATA ENTRY IS CARRIED OUT USING A DIRECT KEY TO DISC FACILITY,
WITH FORMATTED VISUAL DISPLAY SCREENS BEING PRESENTED TO SPEED INPUT. THE
ADVANTAGES OF INPUT VALIDATION AND EFFICIENT EDITING OF ENTERED MATERIAL ARE
FULLY EXPLOITED, AND AN INTERACTIVE THESAURUS MAY ALSO BE USED. DATA ON CAIRS
CAN BE INDEXED USING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS OR HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURES.
ALTERNATIVELY, KEYWORD INDEXING OF THE AUTOMATIC, SEMI-AUTOMATIC OR MANUAL
TYPE MAY BE APPLIED, PLUS EITHER A FREE OR CONTROLLED LANGUAGE VOCABULARY.
SEARCHING PROCEEDS VIA INVERTED FILE AND SER IAL (STRING) SEARCH FUNCTIONS,
ALTHOUGH A VARIETY OF SPECIALISED TASKS ALLOW BULLETINS, LISTS AND CATALOGUES
TO BE PRODUCED. CAIRS IS DESIGNED TO REPLACE ANY APPLICATIONS WHERE MANUAL
CARD INDEX FILING SYSTEMS ARE EMPLOYED, AND IS AVAILABLE AS BOTH A SOFTWARE
SYSTEM OR AS A COMPLETE SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PACKAGE.
ONLINE TRAINING SESSIONS' SUGGESTED GUIDELINES.
     
TABLES ARE SHOWN GIVING GUIDELINES FOR BEGINNING TRAINING, ADVANCED TRAINING,
SUBJECT TRAINING, DATA BASE PRODUCER TRAINING AND INTRODUCTORY WORKSHOPS.
COMPUTER READABLE DATA BASES AND THE FUTURE OF INFORMATION SERVICES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE USICA SEMINAR ON 'ENTERING THE INFORMATION AGE',
BANGALORE, JUNE 3-4, 81. DEALS WITH THE VARIETIES, GENESIS AND GROWTH OF
COMPUTER-READABLE DATA BASES (CRDB). EXPLAINS SOME TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF CRDBS;
AND ALSO THE CRDB SERVICES. REFERS TO THE NEED FOR CRDB RESOURCE SHARING
THROUGH NETWORKING. ENUMERATES THE ROLES OF THE AGENCIES OFFERING CRDB
SERVICES. TAKES NOTE OF THE IMPACT OF CRDB HAS CREATED; AND INDICATES THE
FUTURE TREND RELATING TO INFORMATION SERVICES.
FEATURE COMPARISON OF AN IN-HOUSE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WITH A
COMMERCIAL SEARCH SERVICE.
     
A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ON-LINE SEARCH SERVICE WAS USED AS A STANDARD FOR
COMPARATIVE SEARCHING AND EVALUATION OF AN IN-HOUSE INFORMATION SYSTEM BASED
ON AUTOMATIC INDEXING. SYSTEM FEATURES WERE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED ON THE
BASIS OF THEIR USEFULNESS IN VARIOUS KINDS OF SEARCHING, THEIR EASE IN
IMPLEMENTATION, AND HOW THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY DIFFERENCES IN USER TYPE OR
SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS. SOME COMMON FEATURES OF THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM, SUCH AS
ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, USER-SPECIFIED PRINT FORMATS, DICTIONARY DISPLAY, AND
TRUNCATION, ARE SEEN TO BE UNNECESSARY OR IMPRACTICAL FOR THE IN-HOUSE SYSTEM.
GOOD AMERICAN AND ENGLISH EXPERIENCE WITH ON-LINE SEARCHING.
     
EXAMINES SOME PUBLICATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
COMPUTER SEARCHING. DESCRIBES A 3 YEAR PROJECT (DIALIB) IN CALIFORNIA SEEKING
TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A LINKING AGENT TO COMMERCIAL
DATA BASES USING THE LOCKHEED DIALOG INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICE. THE
SERVICE WAS FREE FOR THE 1ST YEAR ONLY. USERS WERE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND
RESEARCHERS, PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND LIBRARIANS. PROVIDES A CHECKLIST OF
POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN THE PLANNING PHASE. CONCLUDES THAT ON-LINE SERVICES
ARE A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL
REFERENCE SERVICES. DESCRIBES ANOTHER PROJECT INVOLVING 4 PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
ENGLAND. THE PLANNED ON-LINE SERVICE IN LANCASHIRE (BIROS) WAS TO BE A SERVICE
SEPARATE FROM THE MANUAL REFERENCE WORK. HERE TOO, STAFF WAS SPECIALLY TRAINED
AND THE PUBLIC, MAINLY FROM EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, SEEMED WILLING TO PAY
THE NECESSARY FEES. A SET OF ' GUIDELINES' WAS PREPARED. FINALLY, DISCUSSES
ATHERTON AND CHRISTIAN'S' 'LIBRARIANS AND ONLINE SERVICES', WHICH EXAMINES HOW
AND WHY LIBRARIES MAKE AUTOMATED SEARCH SYSTEMS AVAILABLE AND STRESSES THAT
THESE SYSTEMS CHANGE THE ROLE OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN QUALITATIVELY FROM
THAT OF AN ARCHIVIST TO THAT OF AN INFORMATION SPECIALIST.
INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES ONLINE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES' THE HOLES IN THE SWISS
CHEESE.
     
ORIGINALLY ENTITLED INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ONLINE AND PRESENTED AT THE 42ND
ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE, MINNEAPOLIS,
MINNESOTA, 17 OCT 79. ALTHOUGH THE RANGE OF ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES
HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THERE ARE STILL MANY HOLES TO
BE FILLED WITHIN AND AROUND EXISTING SOCIAL SCIENCE DATA BASES. LOOKING AT ONE
SMALL PART OF THE SUBJECT AREA/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-EXAMINES CURRENT DATA
BASES AND POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPANSION.
FRENCH LEGAL AND ECONOMIC DATA BASES AND DATA BANKS.
     
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE ON-LINE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO FRENCH USERS, FROM THE
VIEWPOINT OF INFORMATION PROVISION AS AN INDUSTRY WITH SPECIALISED PRODUCTION
AND DISTRIBUTION AGENCIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF SUBJECT COVERAGE AND SERVICES
FOR DATA BANKS AND BASES IN THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FIELDS DESIGNED FOR THE
FRENCH MARKET, AND THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. OTHER RELEVANT BUT LESS
SPECIALISED INFORMATION SERVICES ARE SURVEYED, AND DEVELOPMENTS IN SERVICE
PROVISION DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO CURRENT STANDARDS, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO THE PROBLEMS OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY.
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN THE HUNGARIAN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.
     
HUNGARIAN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY LEADERS HAVE RECOGNISED THAT THEIR
INDUSTRY'S INFORMATION DEMANDS CAN BE MET ONLY BY SUBSCRIPTION TO INFORMATION
SERVICES USING MODERN DATA PROCESSING METHODS. A COLLECTIVE DATA BASE-THE
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION GROUP OF THE HUNGARIAN ASSOCIATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRIES-WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1970, AND SUBSCRIBES TO SERVICES SUCH AS
FARMDOC, AGDOC, FOODDOC, CHEMDOC, AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. DESCRIBES THE
SERVICES AND THE USE MADE OF THEM.
DATA-TAGGING EXPERIMENT FOR ENERGY-RELATED DOCUMENTS AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS
SERVICE.
     
AN EXPERIMENT IS DESCRIBED THAT EVALUATED THE USEFULNESS AND ECONOMIC
FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING DATA TAGS INTO SECONDARY INFORMATION FILES. TAGS
ARE BRIEF CODES THAT INDICATE THE PRESENCE IN A PRIMARY DOCUMENT OF SPECIFIC
TYPES OF NUMERICAL DATA. TAGS WERE SELECTED IN COOPERATION WITH USERS OF THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S (DOE) RECON SYSTEM AND ADDED TO A SPECIAL VERSION
OF THE COMPUTER-READABLE ENERGY FILE. RECON USERS ASSISTED IN AN EVALUATION OF
THE TAGGING PROCESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT DATA TAGS DO INCREASE ACCESS TO
NUMERICAL DATA IN THE PRIMARY LITERATURE, BUT A FILE SPANNING SEVERAL YEARS IS
NECESSARY TO PRODUCE USEFUL RESULTS. EVALUATION OF PROCESSING COSTS REVEALED
THAT AFTER THE INITIAL TRAINING PERIOD, COSTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER
FOR THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF DATA TAGS EMPLOYED IN THIS STUDY. THE FEASIBILITY
OF INCLUDING DATA TAGS IN NONENERGY SECTIONS OF 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1WAS
EXAMIN ED WITH PRIMARY EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC AND EDITORIAL FACTORS. IT WAS
SHOWN THAT SUBJECT CONTENT GOVERNS THE SELECTION OF DATA TYPES TO BE TAGGED
FOR A SECTION OR GROUP OF RELATED SECTIONS WITH THE OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION
OF USER REQUIREMENTS.
A PILOT TRAINING COURSE FOR ONLINE USE OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS-EXPERIENCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
     
45 AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SPECIALISTS FROM 8 EEC MEMBER COUNTRIES AND EEC
INSTITUTIONS ATTENDED THE 5 DAY COURSE SPONSORED BY THE EEC COMMISSION AND
HELD AT DIMDI (GERMAN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION) IN
COLOGNE 10-14 DEC 79. COURSE GOALS WERE TO INTRODUCE PARTICIPANTS TO THE
ON-LINE USE OF COMPUTERISED AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TO ENCOURAGE THE
ON-LINE USE OF SUCH SYSTEMS AND TO HELP PARTICIPANTS ORGANISE SIMILAR COURSES
IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. INSTRUCTION WAS CENTRED ON PRESENTATION AND
DEMONSTRATION OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGREP, AGRIS, CAB, CRIS, FSTA AND THE
FAL GENE DATA BANK, AND ALSO OF THE EUROPEAN INFORMATION NETWORK EURONET/DIANE
(DIRECT INFORMATION ACCESS NETWORK FOR EUROPE), COMMAND LANGUAGES AND SEARCH
STRATEGIES.
THE USE OF ISBNS COMPARED WITH KEYWORDS AS MEANS OF RETRIEVING BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS ON-LINE.
     
(PROJECT UNDERTAKEN FOR THE BNB RESEARCH FUND, JAN-NOV 79) REPORT OF AN
EXPERIMENT DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY THE TIMES TAKEN TO RETRIEVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS AT AN ON-LINE TERMINAL USING INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBERS AND
KEYWORDS. THE OVERALL RATIO IN FAVOUR OF SEARCHING BY ISBN WAS FOUND TO BE
1'1&.912.
ANSWER-PASSAGE RETRIEVAL BY TEXT SEARCHING.
     
PASSAGE RETRIEVAL (ALREADY OPERATIONAL FOR LAWYERS) HAS ADVANTAGES IN OUTPUT
FORM OVER REFERENCE RETRIEVAL AND IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. PREVIOUS
EXPERIMENTS IN PASSAGE RETRIEVAL FOR SCIENTISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED RECALL AND
FALSE RETRIEVAL RATES AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THOSE OF PRESENT REFERENCE
RETRIEVAL SERVICES. THE PRESENT EXPERIMENT INVOLVED A GREATER VARIETY OF FORMS
OF RETRIEVAL QUESTION. IN ADDITION, SEARCH WORDS WERE SELECTED INDEPENDENTLY
BY 2 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR EACH RETRIEVAL QUESTION. THE SEARCH WORDS SELECTED,
IN COMBINATION WITH THE COMPUTER PROCEDURES USED FOR PASSAGE RETRIEVAL,
PRODUCED AVERAGE RECALL RATIOS OF 72 AND 67%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 2
SELECTORS. THE FALSE RETRIEVAL RATES WERE (EXCEPT FOR 1 PREDICTABLY DIFFICULT
QUESTION) RESPECTIVELY 13 AND 10 FALSELY RETRIEVED SENTENCES PER ANSWER-PAPER
RETRIEVED.
PROBLEM OF RETRIEVAL FILE STRUCTURE OPTIMISATION ACCORDING TO RETRIEVAL TIME
CRITERION.
     
WHEN DEVELOPING ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, THE SPEED OF RESPONSE TO INQUIRIES
IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM'S QUALITY. CONSIDERS A
COMPONENT OF RESPONSE TIME-THE DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME. DISCUSSES DIRECT,
INVERSE, AND COMBINED PATTERNS OF FILE ORGANISATION, MAKES A COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS, AND EVALUATES DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME FOR EACH. PROPOSES A
PROBABILITY MODEL OF RETRIEVAL IN A COMBINED FILE. ON THE BASIS OF THIS MODEL,
THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMISING A COMBINED FILE ACCORDING TO THE TIME CRITERION IS
SOLVED.
FUZZY REQUESTS' AN APPROACH TO WEIGHTED BOOLEAN SEARCHES.
     
CONCERNS THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO PERMIT A PATRON TO REPRESENT THE RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS INDEX TERMS IN A BOOLEAN REQUEST WHILE RETAINING THE
DESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF A BOOLEAN SYSTEM. CLASSICAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS ARE
REVIEWED AND RELATED TO THE NOTION OF FUZZY SETS. THE FUZZY SET CONCEPT THEN
FORMS THE BASIS OF THE CONCEPT OF A FUZZY REQUEST IN WHICH WEIGHTS ARE
ASSIGNED TO INDEX TERMS. THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED, AND IT
IS SHOWN THAT SUCH SYSTEMS RETAIN THE MANIPULABILITY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN
REQUESTS.
SEARCHING BIASES IN LARGE INTERACTIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
THE WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS CONSTRUCT AND MODIFY SEARCH QUERIES ON A LARGE
INTERACTIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC BIASES SIMILAR
TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EXPERIMENTS ON JUDGMENTS UNDER
UNCERTAINTY. THESE BIASES ARE SHARED BY BOTH NAIVE AND SOPHISTICATED SUBJECTS
AND CAUSE THE INQUIRER TO CONSTRUCT AND MODIFY QUERIES INEFFICIENTLY. A
SEARCHING ALGORITHM IS SUGGESTED THAT HELPS THE INQUIRER TO AVOID THE EFFECT
OF THESE BIASES.
AN EXPERIMENT ON THE PHENOMENA OF WORD OCCURRENCES.
     
DESCRIBES THE METHOD OF SELECTING INDEX TERMS DIRECTLY FROM A FREQUENCY LIST.
WORD FREQUENCIES OF AN ARTICLE WERE ANALYSED WHOSE RESULTS CLEARLY INDICATE
THAT THE AUTOMATED SELECTION OF INDEX TERMS FROM A FREQUENCY LIST HOLDS SOME
PROMISE FOR AUTOMATIC INDEXING.
INDEXING EXHAUSTIVITY AND THE COMPUTATION OF SIMILARITY MATRICES.
     
SOME OF THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES USED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
DERIVE CLUSTERS OF DOCUMENTS FROM AN INTERMEDIATE SIMILARITY MATRIX, THE
COMPUTATION OF WHICH INVOLVES COMPARING EACH OF THE DOCUMENTS IN THE
COLLECTION WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED THAT MANY OF
THESE COMPARISONS, SPECIFICALLY THOSE BETWEEN DOCUMENTS HAVING NO TERMS IN
COMMON, MAY BE AVOIDED BY MEANS OF THE USE OF AN INVERTED FILE TO THE DOCUMENT
COLLECTION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH WILL EFFECT REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER
OF INTERDOCUMENT COMPARISONS ONLY IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE EACH INDEXED BY A
LIMITED NUMBER OF INDEXING TERMS; IF EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS USED, MANY
DOCUMENT PAIRS WILL BE COMPARED SEVERAL TIMES OVER AND THE COMPUTATION WILL BE
GREATER THAN WHEN CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES ARE USED TO GENERATE THE SIMILARITY
MATRIX.
PRE-SYNTACTIC STAGE OF TEXT PROCESSING OF ORGANISATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
DOCUMENTATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE LINGUISTIC PREREQUISITES OF THE INTRODUCTION, INTO AUTOMATED
SYSTEMS OF PROCESSING ORGANISATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTATION (OAD),
OF A SPECIAL PRE-SYNTACTIC STAGE FOR PROCESSING STABLE WORD COMBINATIONS IN
THE OAD SUBLANGUAGE. CLASSIFIES THESE WORD COMBINATIONS AND DETERMINES THE
CHARACTER OF THEIR STABILITY. MAKES A CONTENT-AND-LINGUISTIC STATEMENT OF
TASKS OF THE PRE-SYNTACTIC PROCESSING STAGE WHEN PLACED BETWEEN THE
MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTIC STAGES OF THE ANALYSIS.
FUNCTIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE SENTENCE AND CONTEXT DETERMINATION.
     
COMPARES A NUMBER OF APPROACHES TO THE FUNCTIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF A SENTENCE
AND EXPLAINS THE APPROACH WHICH IS CHOSEN.
THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS MOST OFFICE STAFF WILL EXPERIENCE A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT
AS AUTOMATED SYSTEMS AFFECT THEIR WORK PATTERNS. BRIEFLY LOOKS AT EQUIPMENT
CURRENTLY IN USE SUCH AS WORD PROCESSORS, MOSTLY LIMITED TO DOCUMENT
PRODUCTION TYPE ACTIVITIES, AND ASSESSES FUTURE TRENDS TOWARDS INTEGRATED
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
AN INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY.
     
ORIGINALLY PREPARED FOR THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS (RICS),
UK, ANNUAL CONFERENCE 1980. ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECTS OF MODERN
TECHNOLOGY ON ALL ASPECTS OF SURVEYING. LOOKS AT GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS,
INCLUDING SOFTWARE BACKUP, AND SEEKS TO RELATE THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO THE MORE
SPECIALISED REQUIREMENTS OF EACH BRANCH OF THE PROFESSION AND ADD FURTHER
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE RICS IN BOTH ADVISING AND TRAINING
ITS MEMBERS IS DISCUSSED, WHILST THE MORE SPECIALIST REQUIREMENTS OF GENERAL
OFFICE STAFF TRAINING ARE ALSO REVIEWED. OUTLINES METHODS WHEREBY SURVEYORS
AND THE RICS CAN KEEP ABREAST OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE NEXT DECADE
AND MAKE SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WOULD AFFECT FUTURE RICS
POLICY.
THE SILICON CHIP BOOK.
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERS FROM THE EARLIEST 'DINOSAURS' THE SIZE OF
AN OFFICE TO THE MINUTE SOLID-STATE MICROPROCESSOR, ABLE TO ANALYSE AND REPORT

CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD STANDARDISING COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN
MADE BY A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL ORGANISATIONS. DESCRIBES A
PROTOCOL FOR FILE TRANSFER.
CHARACTERISTICS OF MICROS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS.
     
IN RECENT YEARS, THE MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS HAS MUSHROOMED MAKING SUCH
SYSTEMS AVAILABLE AT PRICES FROM UNDER *6100-*610,000'S, RIVALLING THE
FACILITIES AND POWER OF MINICOMPUTERS OR EVEN SMALL MAINFRAMES. GIVES A BRIEF
HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROCOMPUTERS AND DESCRIBES THE VARIOUS
COMPONENTS OF SUCH A SYSTEM. PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TYPE OF
COMPONENT THAT IS LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE IN SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS
'SMALL BUSINESS SYSTEMS' AND INVESTIGATES THE APPLICATIONS OF SUCH SYSTEMS.
DESPITE THE VAST MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS, THERE ARE STILL MANY RESTRICTIONS
WHICH MAY PREVENT THEIR BEING USED IN SOME APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE CAPACITY
OF THE PRIMARY MEMORY. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE VERY FEW STANDARDS IN THE AREA
OF MICROCOMPUTERS, LEADING TO PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY BOTH FROM THE HARDWARE
AND SOFTWARE VIEWPOINT. SUCH PROBLEMS ARE BEING OVERCOME AT PRESENT BUT IT IS
LIKELY THAT THEY WILL PERSIST FOR SOME TIME TO  COME AS THE PRESSURES OF
MARKETING CANNOT WAIT FOR STANDARDS TO BE DEVELOPED. THE RESTRICTIONS OF
MICROCOMPUTERS ARE ALSO BEING OVERCOME, PARTICULARLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF
16-BIT (AND EVEN 32-BIT) PROCESSORS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED METHODS OF STORAGE,
SUCH AS 'BUBBLE MEMORIES'. EXAMINES SUCH DEVELOPMENTS AND BRIEFLY CONTRASTS
DEVELOPMENTS IN HARDWARE WITH THOSE IN SOFTWARE.
THE USE OF TRIGRAM ANALYSIS FOR SPELLING ERROR DETECTION.
     
WORK PERFORMED UNDER THE SPELLING ERROR DETECTION CORRECTION PROJECT
(SPEEDCOP) SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) AT CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) TO DEVISE EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC METHODS OF DETECTING AND
CORRECTING MISSPELLINGS IN SCHOLARLY AND SCIENTIFIC TEXT IS DESCRIBED. THE
INVESTIGATION WAS APPLIED TO 50,000 WORD/MISSPELLING PAIRS COLLECTED FROM 6
DATASETS (2CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NOTES, BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS, CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1,
AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY PRIMARY JOURNAL KEYBOARDING, 2INFORMATION SCIENCE
ABSTRACTS1, AND DISTRIBUTED ON-LINE EDITING (DOLE) (A CAS INTERNAL DATASET
ESPECIALLY SUITED TO SPELLING ERROR STUDIES). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO
DETERMINE THE UTILITY OF TRIGRAM ANALYSIS IN THE AUTOMATIC DETECTION AND/OR
CORRECTION OF MISSPELLINGS.
WHATS' NEW IN WORD/TEXT PROCESSING.
     
THE TECHNOLOGIES OF DATA, WORD, AND TEXT PROCESSING ARE MERGING AND THIS
DEVELOPMENT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE FULLY INTEGRATED OFFICE. COMPLETE
INTEGRATION SHOULD BRING ABOUT CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT IN EFFICIENCY AND A
REDUCTION IN COST OF OFFICE PERSONNEL. PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS DESIGNED FOR THE INTEGRATED OFFICE OF THE FUTURE.
MERGING DP AND WP' THE OFFICE OF THE FUTURE IS NOW.
     
WORD PROCESSING AND DATA PROCESSING, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGIES, ARE BEGINNING TO MERGE INTO INTEGRATED OFFICE SYSTEMS.
EVENTUALLY, THIS MERGER WILL MAKE THE OFFICE OF THE FUTURE A REALITY. PRESENT
TRENDS AND EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE EXAMINED. THE AVAILABILITY OF CHEAPER
MACHINES, THE FLEXIBILITY OF MULTIFUNCTION WORK STATIONS, POTENTIAL MARKETS,
THE ROLE OF TRAINING, ETC. ARE CONSIDERED.
COMPUTERIZED TEXT MANAGEMENT.
     
SOME APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTERISED TEXT MANAGEMENT (CIM) ARE CONSIDERED, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCED TEXT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, A SOFTWARE
PACKAGE SUPPLIED BY IBM. A DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN OF HOW DATA BASES WERE SET UP
AT ONE TRAFFIC ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IN THE US AND AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
SOCIAL SERVICES. THE BENEFITS OF CTM ARE SUMMARISED.
CLUSTERED SYSTEMS INTEGRATE INFORMATION.
     
THE 2ND PART OF A 3-PART SERIES CONCERNING TEXT-EDITING EQUIPMENT. CLUSTERED
SYSTEMS CONTAIN MULTIPLE WORK STATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND PERIPHERAL DEVICES.
THEY ALLOW USERS TO SHARE A COMMON DATA BASE AND FACILITIES, REDUCING OVERALL
SYSTEM COSTS AND PROVIDING EXPANDED CAPABILITIES FOR EACH USER. LISTS THE
MAJOR CLUSTERED SYSTEMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE LATEST
ENHANCEMENTS AND PLANNED CAPABILITIES.
USE OF WORD PROCESSING IN PREPARING A CONTAMINATION CONTROL TRAINING MANUAL.
     
WORD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR AN INSTRUCTOR TO CREATE A
VARIETY OF TRAINING MANUALS SLANTED TOWARD THE WIDE VARIATIONS IN BACKGROUND
AND EXPERIENCE OF CLASS MEMBERS. SUCH MANUALS AID IN MORE EFFICIENT USE OF
CLASSROOM AND STUDENT TIME AND EFFORT. MANUAL PREPARATION TIME MAY BE REDUCED
AS MUCH AS 90%.

THE BORN-AGAIN TECHNOLOGY. TELECOMMUNICATIONS' A SURVEY.
     
NEW TECHNOLOGY IS OFFERING THE WORLD INSTANT 2-WAY COMMUNICATION OF DATA,
DOCUMENTS, AND VOICE FROM VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE TO ANYWHERE. THE US GOVERNMENT
HAS DISMANTLED THE MONOPOLY OF CERTAIN TELECOMMUNICATIONS GIANTS TO STIMULATE
COMPETITION IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION
SEEM ENORMOUS, BUT SO DO THE RISKS. DISCUSSES DEVELOPMENTS AND INNOVATIONS IN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND WHETHER THE UK SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE
USA.

ELECTRONIC MAIL AND REVIEWS PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN THE UK.
IS ELECTRONIC MAIL HERE TO STAY?.
     
CONSULTANCIES, LIKE IDC, MACKINTOSH CONSULTANTS, AND THE YANKEE GROUP, PREDICT
A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL. THE YANKEE GROUP BELIEVES THAT ELECTRONIC
MAIL MESSAGES WILL GROW FROM ALMOST 600,000 IN 1978 TO OVER 2 MILLION IN 1983.
TECHNOLOGY IS NOW FORCING THE COST OF ELECTRONIC MAIL DOWN, BUT COST
JUSTIFICATION STILL REMAINS A MAJOR PROBLEM. SPECIFIC ELECTRONIC MAIL PRODUCTS
ARE DESCRIBED.
THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR LETTERS.
     
DESCRIBES ACTIVITIES OF THE FRENCH NATIONAL CENTRE FOR LETTERS SINCE
REORGANISATION IN 1976. STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES ARE OUTLINED, AND DETAILS
GIVEN ON CURRENT POLICY AS IMPLEMENTED BETWEEN 1976 AND 1979 IN PROVIDING

ACTIVITIES AND JOURNALS; PUBLISHING; PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND BOOK PROMOTION;
TRANSLATION; AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR AUTHORS.
THE BOOK HOUSE APPEAL: IMPORTANT IN THESE TIMES.
     
THE NATIONAL BOOK LEAGUE (UK) RECENTLY MOVED TO NEW PREMISES AT 'BOOK HOUSE',
WANDSWORTH, LONDON. GENERAL REFURBISHMENT AND REDECORATION IS NEEDED AND A
BOOK HOUSE APPEAL IS BEING MOUNTED BY THE PUBLISHERS AND BOOKSELLERS
ASSOCIATIONS. DESCRIBES, BRIEFLY, THE WORK OF THE NBL, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE NEW BUILDING IN FURTHERING THE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NBL.
MEANINGS OF LITERACY IN THE THIRD WORLD: THE CONCEPTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE
RIJCHARY REFORM MOVEMENT IN HIGHLAND PERU.
     
EXAMINES SOME OF THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY
OF THE SORT WHICH WOULD LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR MEANINGFUL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT
IN PERU. HIGHLAND STRUCTURES OF SOCIAL AND PRODUCTIVE RELATIONS HAVE LONG
OBSTRUCTED OFFICIAL EFFORTS, BUT THE RIJCHARY MOVEMENT, ACTIVE IN THE
DEPARTMENT OF PUNO IN THE 30S AND 40S, SUGGESTS BY CONTRAST SOME OF THE
ELEMENTS THAT HAVE BOTH STIRRED AND RESPONDED TO INDIGENOUS ASPIRATIONS.
'RIJCHARY' MEANS 'AWAKEN!' AND THE MOVEMENT, LED BY NUNEZ BUTRON,
DOCTOR-IN-RESIDENCE FOR PUNO'S AZANGARO PROVINCE, INCLUDED CAMPAIGNS FOR BASIC
PUBLIC HYGIENE, PATRIOTISM AND LITERACY.
ILLITERACY IN THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC.
     
REPORT ON A CONFERENCE, HELD BY EDUCATIONALISTS, SOCIOLOGISTS AND LIBRARIANS
IN BREMEN, NOV 80, ON ILLITERACY AMONG CHILDREN AND ADULTS. RECENT CAMPAIGNS
AGAINST ILLITERACY ABROAD SHOW RESULTS FAR IN ADVANCE OF THOSE HITHERTO
ACHIEVED IN WEST GERMANY. RESEARCHERS MUST FIND OUT WHO THE ILLITERATE ARE AND
THE BEST WAYS TO REACH THEM; SOME WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE BY STAFF AT ADULT
EDUCATION CENTRES, PENAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE LOCAL PRESS. PROBLEMS OF STAFF
AND MONEY SHORTAGES MUST BE OVERCOME AND BEGINNERS' READING BOOKS PRODUCED
SUITABLE FOR ADULTS. LIBRARIANS CAN HELP BY WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND
KINDERGARTENS TO ALLEVIATE THE FEAR OF ENTERING A LIBRARY FELT BY MANY PEOPLE;
THEY CAN PROVIDE SUITABLE MEDIA TO HELP SCHOOL TEACHERS, ADULT EDUCATION
CENTRES AND THE READERS THEMSELVES AND ASSIST IN MEDIA PRODUCTION BY
COOPERATING WITH AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS.
THE STATE OF BIBLIOGRAPHY IN HUNGARY.
     
REVIEWS PROGRESS MADE IN THE COMPILATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN HUNGARY SINCE
THE NATIONAL WORKING CONFERENCE ON BIBLIOGRAPHY IN 1961 HAD IDENTIFIED LARGE
GAPS IN COVERAGE AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATION. THE NATIONAL SZECHENYI LIBRARY
HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AN UP-TO-DATE SYSTEM FOR THE
HUNGARIAN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY; THE GREATEST BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE PERIOD
1921-44. PROGRESS IN SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES HAS BEEN HAPHAZARD WITH OVERLAP IN
SOME FIELDS WHILE CERTAIN OTHER FIELDS SUCH AS MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS HAVE NO
CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES. IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT WITHOUT A COORDINATING BODY TO
PLAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACTIVITIES, IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO HAVE A COMPLETE
SYSTEM OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN HUNGARY.
A SELECT ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS FOR UGANDA,
FOLLOWED BY AN EXPANDED BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
THIS BIBLIOGRAPHY IDENTIFIES AVAILABLE, CLEARLY WRITTEN, NON-TECHNICAL
PUBLICATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES THAT WILL HELP USAID PERSONNEL AND
CONTRACTORS IN THE UGANDA PROGRAMME TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT DEVELOPMENT
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMES AND PROJECTS ADAPTED TO THE DISTINCTIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC
INSTITUTIONS, THE CULTURE, AND THE HISTORIC SETTING OF THAT COUNTRY.
IMPACT OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND PHOTOCOPYING ON PUBLISHING PROFITABILITY.
     
REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN SITUATION REGARDING ILLICIT PHOTOCOPYING
AND THE RESULTANT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, SUPPLY OF PHOTOCOPIES OF ARTICLES,
AND OPERATION OF DATA BASES IN RELATION TO PUBLISHING PROFITABILITY.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY' PATENTS, COPYRIGHT, TRADE MARKS AND ALLIED RIGHTS.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP AND A GROUPING ENCRUSTATION OF INTERNATIONAL
CONVENTIONS, SKETCHING IN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEBATES WHICH ALWAYS
SURROUND THE SUBJECT. COVERS' SOURCES OF THE LAW AND PRESSURES FOR ITS
DEVELOPMENT; ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS; PATENTS-THEIR GROWTH AND PURPOSE, GRANT
AND CONTENT, VALIDITY, SCOPE OF MONOPOLY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS AND EXPLOITATION;
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; COPYRIGHT-ITS RANGE AND AIMS, SUBSISTENCE OF
COPYRIGHT, INFRINGEMENT, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND EXPLOITATION AND PARTICULAR
CASES; AND TRADE MARKS AND NAMES.
POLAND' THE DAM BREAKS.
     
OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF SEVERE CENSORSHIP RESTRICTIONS IN POLAND AND EVENTS
LEADING TO THE NEW CENSORSHIP LAW WHICH CAME INTO FORCE ON 1 OCT 81. THIS LAW
GIVES PUBLISHERS AND WRITERS MORE FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT OF APPEAL AGAINST
CENSORSHIP DECISIONS. BRIEFLY DISCUSSES HOW THE LAW WILL AFFECT PUBLISHING.
INTERACTION OF LIBRARIES AND PUBLISHERS.
     
LIBRARIES AND PUBLISHERS HAVE EVOLVED TOGETHER. PUBLISHERS RELY ON LIBRARIES
AS A MINIMUM MARKET FOR THEIR SCHOLARLY PRODUCTS. INFLATIONARY PRESSURES HAVE
CAUSED PUBLISHERS TO INCREASE PRICES THAT, IN TURN, STRAIN LIBRARY BUDGETS
THAT HAVE NOT INCREASED AS FAST, AND WHICH, IN TURN, UNDERMINE THE MINIMAL
DEMAND PUBLISHERS CAN COUNT ON, ADDING TO INFLATIONARY PRESSURE. A SIMPLE
MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR THE DYNAMICS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND
PUBLISHERS IS ANALYSED.
REFERENCE AID' DATA ON SERIAL PUBLICATIONS OF VIETNAM.
     
THE REPORT IS AN ALPHABETICAL LISTING OF PERIODICALS PUBLISHED IN THE
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM ALONG WITH AVAILABLE DATA ON ALTERNATE TITLES,
SPONSORSHIP, OFFICERS AND CONTENTS FOR EACH PUBLICATION. APPROXIMATELY 311
NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, JOURNALS, BULLETINS AND NEWSLETTERS ARE PUBLISHED
INCLUDING 225 NATIONAL LEVEL PUBLICATIONS AND 86 LOCAL LEVEL PUBLICATIONS.
MODERN TECHNIQUES IN PERIODICAL PUBLISHING (IN ITALIAN).
     
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECTING PERIODICAL PUBLISHING ARE EXAMINED, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO THEIR EFFECTS ON EDITORIAL AND PRODUCTION PROCEDURES. THE
TECHNOLOGIES DISCUSSED INCLUDE VDU TERMINALS, OCR, PHOTOTYPESETTING WITH CRT
TERMINALS, INK JET PRINTING AND REMOTE PRESS CONTROL. COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY
AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO TELETEXT,
VIEWDATA AND FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION.
PUBLICATIONS, DOCUMENTATION AND MEANS FOR THEIR DISSEMINATION IN THE
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES.
     
BASED ON DISCUSSIONS CONDUCTED WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE COMMISSION OF THE
EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES DURING A STUDY VISIT TO BRUSSELS, NOV 79. UK MEMBERSHIP
OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES HAS ADDED A NEW DIMENSION TO THE NATIONAL
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND HAS GENERATED A FRESH BODY OF LEGISLATIVE AND
ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION. IT HAS ALSO PROVIDED LIBRARIANS WITH A NEW SERIES OF
CHALLENGES. THE STUDY VISIT WAS CONCEIVED AS A FACT-FINDING EXERCISE TO GATHER
BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMMUNITY'S PUBLISHING
PROGRAMME AND DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. CONSEQUENTLY, THE REPORT CONTAINS SEPARATE
CHAPTERS ON COMMUNITY PUBLICATIONS POLICY, ON THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS
OF COMMISSION DOCUMENTS (AS DISTINCT FROM PUBLICATIONS) AND ON THE RANGE OF
AUTOMATED INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL SERVICES OFFERED TO MEMBERS OF STAFF WITHIN
THE COMMISSION. ALSO CONTAINS A CHAPTER ON EUROPEAN DOCUMENTAT ION CENTRES AND
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.
COMMONWEALTH OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS AND THE RAZOR GANG' SOME THOUGHTS.
     
REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE CUTS IN AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL EXPENDITURE RECENTLY
RECOMMENDED BY THE REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS AS THEY AFFECT THE
PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE. DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THE RECOMMENDED MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE THE LEASING OF THE AGPS BOOKSHOPS TO
THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND RESTRICTING THE MINISTERIAL DOCUMENT SERVICE, AND
MENTIONS SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS WHICH ARE TO CEASE. URGES LIBRARIANS TO
CAREFULLY MONITOR THE EFFECTS OF THESE ECONOMIES IN PUBLISHING, AND TO MAKE
KNOWN TO OFFICIAL CHANNELS THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THE CREATION OF ADEQUATE
PROCESSES OF CONSULTATION ON OFFICIAL PUBLISHING.
ANALYSIS OF THE CHOICE OF JOURNALS FOR PUBLICATION BY TRIDIAN PHYSICISTS.
     
ANALYSES THE DATA REGARDING MEDIA OF PUBLICATION BY INDIAN PHYSICISTS ON THE
BASIS OF 2PHYSICS ABSTRACTS1, 1973, GIVING DISTRIBUTION OF RESEARCH OUTPUT
ACCORDING TO THE INSTITUTIONS, FIELD OF SPECIALISATION AND GEOGRAPHICAL
DISTRIBUTION IN FOREIGN JOURNALS. PROVIDES DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICS RESEARCH
OUTPUTS IN INDIAN JOURNALS. STRESSES NEED FOR COLLABORATION BETWEEN EDITORS OF
PHYSICS JOURNALS IN INDIA.
THE PREPARATION OF A COMPUTER-GENERATED CONCORDANCE.
     
DESCRIBES THE PREPARATION OF 2A CONCORDANCE AND WORD-LISTS TO THE POEMS OF
DYLAN THOMAS 1USING THE COCOA COMPUTER BASED CONCORDANCING PROGRAM. DISCUSSES'
THE SELECTION OF THE BASE TEXT; THE PRODUCTION OF THE INITIAL WORKING
CONCORDANCE; THE COMPILATION, FROM HEAD WORDS IN THE CONCORDANCE, OF COMPLETE
WORD LISTS SORTED BOTH ALPHABETICALLY AND BY FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE; AND THE
COMPILATION, (MAINLY BY HAND), OF A NUMBER OF WORD LISTS OF SPECIFIC INTEREST.
PROBLEMS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL INDEXING.
     
DISCUSSES IN SOME DETAIL SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL
INDEXING. MENTIONS SOME CONVENTIONS CUSTOMARY IN UK ARCHAEOLOGICAL INDEXING,
SETS OUT SOME DILEMMAS, AND CITES SOME GOOD AND BAD EXAMPLES. HIGHLIGHTS THE
FACT THAT ARCHAEOLOGY IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX SUBJECT COVERING A VERY WIDE RANGE
OF ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES AND DEMANDING GREAT FLEXIBILITY AND KNOWLEDGE FROM ITS
INDEXERS.
THE MODERN LIBRARY SERIES AND AMERICAN CULTURAL LIFE.
     
THE MODERN LIBRARY WAS CONCEIVED BY ALBERT BONI, A 25-YEAR-OLD GREENWICH
VILLAGE BOOKSELLER AND PUBLISHER, AS A SERIES OF HARDBOUND REPRINTS OF
IMPORTANT WORKS OF LITERATURE AND THOUGHT. IT LASTED FROM 1917 TO 1970, AND
THE SMALL, IN EXPENSIVE VOLUMES WERE STOCKED AT VIRTUALLY EVERY BOOKSTORE AND
MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORE IN THE USA. TRACES THE HISTORY OF THE SERIES, AND
INVESTIGATES ITS ROLE IN REFLECTING AMERICAN CULTURAL LIFE.
THE FUTURE OF INDEXES AND INDEXING.
     
TEXT OF THE ADDRESS GIVEN TO THE SOCIETY OF INDEXERS, 28 MAY 1981. CONSIDERS
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH WHICH INDEXERS ARE CURRENTLY CONCERNED. TOPICS
DISCUSSED INCLUDE: THE 2 TYPES OF INDEXES TO BE FOUND IN CONTEMPORARY
PUBLICATIONS; SOME VALUABLE INDEXING MANUALS WHICH SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO
INDEXERS; SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT WHICH EXISTS IN INDEXING PRACTICE-IN
PARTICULAR THE ELIMINATION OF 'SEE' AND 'SEE ALSO' REFERENCES; THE SIZE OF
TYPE USED IN INDEXES; THE INDEXING OF FICTION; AND THE COMPILATION OF THESAURI
FOR THE USE OF INDEXERS.
PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A BOOK AND ITS INDEX AS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
THE RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE OF BOOK INDEXES CAN BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF THEIR
ABILITY TO DIRECT A USER SELECTIVELY TO TEXT MATERIAL WHOSE IDENTITY BUT NOT
LOCATION IS KNOWN. THE METHOD REQUIRES HUMAN SEARCHERS TO BASE THEIR SEARCHING
STRATEGIES ON ACTUAL PASSAGES FROM THE BOOK RATHER THAN ON TEST QUERIES,
NATURAL OR CONTRIVED. IT CIRCUMVENTS THE NEED FOR RELEVANCE JUDGMENT, BUT
STILL YIELDS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT CORRESPOND APPROXIMATELY TO THE
RECALL AND PRECISION RATIOS OF LARGE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM EVALUATION.
COMPUTER ASSISTANCE IN INDEXING WITH INDEX.
     
DESCRIBES THE COMPILATION OF INDEXES TO 2 BOOKS USING THE PROGRAM INDEX ON THE
MTS (MICHIGAN TERMINAL SYSTEM) OPERATING THE IBM 378/3033 COMPUTER. DISCUSSES
THE ADVANTAGES OF COMPUTER INDEXING, WHICH INCLUDE' SPEED IN PREPARATION;
ACCURACY IN TRANSCRIPTION; AND EASE OF TRANSMISSION FROM 1 LOCATION TO
ANOTHER. CONCLUDES, HOWEVER, THAT IT IS AN AID RATHER THAN A COMPETITOR TO
INDEXES, SINCE AN INDEXER MUST STILL MAKE DECISIONS AS TO CROSS REFERENCING,
SUBHEADS, AND CATEGORIES.
BOOK REVIEWS IN GOVERNMENT PERIODICALS.
     
153 PERIODICALS PUBLISHED BY THE US GOVERNMENT AND INDEXED IN THE 2INDEX TO
U.S. GOVERNMENT PERIODICALS 1WERE SEARCHED FOR BOOK REVIEWS. 20 CARRY BOOK
REVIEWS REGULARLY (THESE ARE LISTED WITH COMMENTS AND INFORMATION ON FREQUENCY
AND SU/DOC NUMBER); 81 CONTAIN LISTS OF THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTAL PUBLICATIONS,
OTHER GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE MATERIAL, OR EXTENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
REFERENCES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ARTICLES; AND A TOTAL OF 84 CARRY AT LEAST
ONE OF THE PRECEDING CATEGORIES (THE TITLES ARE LISTED). CONCLUDES THAT A
GREAT DEAL OF USEFUL INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM GOVERNMENT
JOURNALS-LIBRARIANS INVOLVED IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT MUST NOT OVERLOOK THEM.
A SEARCH FOR JEWISH CONTENT IN AMERICAN CHILDREN'S FICTION.
     
(PHD THESIS-NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.) STUDY OF THE AMOUNT OF JEWISH CONTENT IN
CONTEMPORARY JUVENILE REALISTIC FICTION WITH JEWISH CHARACTERS, FOCUSING ON
RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR ACTIVITIES IN THE DAILY LIVES OF THE FICTIONAL
CHARACTERS; THEIR PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL AND INFORMAL ASSOCIATIONS AND
INSTITUTIONS; THE EFFECT BEING JEWISH HAD ON THEM AND THEIR RESPONSES TO WORLD
AND NATIONAL EVENTS OF RELEVANCE TO JEWS; AND THE ATTITUDES, VALUES, CONCERNS,
AND GOALS, ROOTED IN JEWISH TRADITION, ATTRIBUTED TO THEM BY THE AUTHORS.
PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT.
     
A THEMATIC ISSUE DISCUSSING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT AND THE
SITUATION IN EUROPE, UK, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, USA, AND SOUTH
AFRICA. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE 10 ARTICLES, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
PRACTICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). DISCUSSES THE
JUSTICE OF COMPENSATING AN AUTHOR WHEN HIS BOOKS ARE USED; THE USE OF PLR TO
ENCOURAGE NATIVE AUTHORS; PLR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA; INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS;
EFFECTS OF EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF PLR TO ENCOMPASS ALL LIBRARIES AND ALSO BOOK
USE WITHIN LIBRARIES; PROBLEMS OF MEASURING BOOK USE; THE ROLE OF THE
CLEARINGHOUSE; FUNDING; LEVELS OF PAYMENT; COST OF PLR SCHEMES; PROCEDURES FOR
INTRODUCING A PLR SCHEME; AND POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF PLR CONCERNING AUTHORS.
POINTS OF VIEW OF LIBRARIANS' ALTERNATIVES TO PLR.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). LISTS THE
MAJOR POINTS OF LIBRARIAN OPPOSITION TO PLR, FOCUSING ON THE QUESTIONS' DO
AUTHORS HAVE NATURAL PROPRIETARY RIGHTS CONCERNING THEIR TEXTS; ARE LIBRARIES
INFRINGING THESE RIGHTS; DO AUTHORS SUFFER FINANCIAL DAMAGE THROUGH LIBRARY
CIRCULATION; WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF PLR ON LIBRARIES; AND WHO WILL REALLY
BENEFIT FROM PLR. LIBRARIANS DO RECOGNISE THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT OF MOST AUTHORS
AND HAVE SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES TO PLR IN THE AREAS OF' CURTAILMENT OF LIBRARY
PURCHASES; SPECIAL PRICING OF LIBRARY BOOKS; DIRECT TAX RELIEF; AUGMENTATION
OF ROYALTY INCOME; AND AUGMENTED PROGRAMMES OF LITERARY AWARDS.
LEGAL ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). MOST PLR
PROPONENTS CONTENT THAT PLR LEGISLATION IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW,
BUT IN ONLY 1 OF THE 10 COUNTRIES TO ENACT PLR LEGISLATION HAS THE STATUTE
BEEN MADE A PART OF COPYRIGHT LAW. THE PLR CONCEPT DOES NOT FIT NEATLY INTO
THE PRINCIPLES OF US COPYRIGHT LAW, BUT THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF 2DROIT
DE SUITE1 LEGISLATION (REQUIRING PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES TO ARTISTS FOR RESALE OF
THEIR WORKS) IN CALIFORNIA IS AN INDICATION THAT PLR IS A WORKABLE CONCEPT IN
THE US LEGAL STRUCTURE.
PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' A HISTORY OF THE IDEA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). THE IDEA THAT AN
AUTHOR IS ENTITLED TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THE MULTIPLE USES OF HIS COPYRIGHTED
BOOKS IN LIBRARIES IS RELATIVELY NEW, ONLY BEING DISCUSSED SINCE SHORTLY
BEFORE 1920. IDENTIFIES FACTORS THAT HAVE ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT AND
GROWTH OF THIS CONCEPT; OUTLINES THE ARGUMENTS ADVANED BY ITS PROPONENTS AND
OPPONENTS; BRIEFLY DESCRIBES PLR LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA; AND TRACES THE
CAMPAIGN FOR LEGISLATION IN THE UK.
THE SITUATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THE
CASES FOR AND AGAINST PLR IN THE UK; THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE PLR
CAMPAIGN; ATTEMPTS TO INTRODUCE PLR LEGISLATION IN PARLIAMENT; PROVISIONS OF
THE PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ACT PASSED IN 1979; AND MOVES TOWARDS THE ACT'S
IMPLEMENTATION.
SITUATION IN COUNTRIES OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). OUTLINES THE
PLR SCHEMES OPERATING IN DENMARK, NORWAY, SWEDEN, FINLAND, ICELAND, THE
NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY. ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A JOINT PLR SCHEME IN
SCANDINAVIA, OR AT LEAST RECIPROCAL BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, HAVE BEEN
UNSUCCESSFUL. DENMARK, THE NETHERLANDS, AND WEST GERMANY ARE FACING THE
PROBLEM OF MAINTAINING DIFFERENT SCHEMES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC
COMMUNITY (EEC). OF THESE 3, ONLY WEST GERMANY HAS A PLR SCHEME WHICH IS
WITHIN ITS COPYRIGHT LAWS AND WHICH DOES NOT OPERATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS
OWN CITIZENS. THE EEC PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY; THE
EFFECT OF THIS ON PLR IS BEING DEBATED.
PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE SOUTH AFRICAN SCENE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). IN SOUTH
AFRICA, AUTHORS ARE NOT REMUNERATED FOR USE OF THEIR WORKS IN LIBRARIES AND,
IN COMPARISON WITH MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES, VERY LITTLE IS BEING DONE BY THE
STATE TO SUPPORT AUTHORS FINANCIALLY AND STIMULATE LOCAL BOOK PRODUCTION AND
LITERATURE. RELATIVELY FEW PUBLICATIONS ON PLR HAVE APPEARED AND THE AUTHORS'
CAMPAIGN FOR A PLR SYSTEM HAS NOT YET GAINED MOMENTUM.
THE SITUATION IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). DISCUSSION ON
PLR IS MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN CANADA THAN IN THE USA-AUTHORS' AND
LIBRARIANS' GROUPS HAVE ISSUED RESOLUTIONS AND MANIFESTOES; FORMAL DEBATES
HAVE BEEN HELD; AND THE CANADA COUNCIL (A GOVERNMENTAL CORPORATION WHICH
ADMINISTERS GRANT PROGRAMMES FOR ARTISTS AND AUTHORS) IS DEVELOPING A MODEL
FOR COMPENSATING AUTHORS, BASED ON HOLDINGS OF THEIR WORKS BY LIBRARIES. GIVEN
THE PRESENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE USA, PLR ISSUES ARE NOT AS TIGHTLY DRAWN
THERE. MOST US LIBRARIANS ARE ONLY DIMLY AWARE OF PLR, BUT MILITANCY AMONG
PROFESSIONAL AUTHORS IS GROWING.
PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE AMERICAN AUTHOR'S VIEWPOINT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). PLR FACES
OBSTACLES THAT MAY WELL KEEP IT FROM US SHORES FOR A LONG TIME. A SAMPLING OF
US AUTHORS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS, BUT HARBOUR AN
ATTRACTION TO PLR THAT MAY BLOSSOM INTO THE KIND OF SUPPORT THE CONCEPT HAS
FOUND ELSEWHERE. THIS MAY GIVE PLR A RING OF INEVITABILITY.
COPYRIGHT AND TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION-AN INTRODUCTION.
     
PROVISIONS OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL COPYRIGHT ACT MOST RELEVANT FOR THE DELIVERY
OF INFORMATION SERVICES ARE DESCRIBED. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO LEGAL
QUESTIONS CONCERNING PHOTOCOPYING.
COPYRIGHT SHOULD REST ON AGREEMENTS NOT FORCE.
     
INTERVIEWS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COPYRIGHT LAW REVISION COMMITTEE, MOGENS
KOKTVEDGAARD. HE ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSALS CONTAIN NO CHANGE OF PRINCIPLE, BUT
THAT THE PROBLEM OF PROFESSIONAL COPYING OF MUSICAL WORKS ESPECIALLY HAS BEEN
TACKLED; MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR INFRINGEMENTS OF COPYRIGHT IS ENVISAGED.
PHOTOCOPYING OF PRINTED MATTER BY EDUCATIONAL AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IS BEING
BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WITH BETTER SYSTEMS OF REPORTING USE. IT IS UP TO THE
ORGANISATIONS REPRESENTING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO PRODUCE A SYSTEM OF
COLLECTIVE ADMINISTRATION FOR DEALING WITH USERS. ABOLITION OF COPYRIGHT,
ARGUED BY THOSE WHO WANT A FREE MARKET IN CULTURAL PRODUCTS, WOULD LEAD TO THE
DEATH OF CULTURE. LICENCE AGREEMENTS ARE MUCH TO BE PREFERRED TO COMPULSORY
LICENCES. BUT SUCH A SYSTEM MUST BE COMBINED WITH FORMS OF STATE SUPPORT FOR
THE PRODUCERS.
PERIODICALS FOR CHILDREN' A SELECTION.
     
AN EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE CURRENT PERIODICALS FOR CHILDREN WHICH ARE FOUND
MOST FREQUENTLY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. THE

EXTEMPLO-REFLECTIONS ON A YEAR.
     
THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL VIA SCANNET, EXTEMPLO, COMPLETED ITS 2ND YEAR IN 1980.
IT DRAWS TOGETHER NOTES ON LECTURES, COURSES AND CONFERENCES ON SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION WITHIN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES. ITS DECENTRALISED EDITING, BY LOCAL
EDITORS IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES, MAY BE A PRECURSOR TO THE
AUTHOR/EDITOR/REVIEWER COMMUNICATION IN FUTURE SCIENTIFIC ELECTRONIC JOURNALS.
EXTEMPLO IS ENTERED VIA A FAIRLY SIMPLE EDITING PROCEDURE INTO THE DEC10
COMPUTER AT GOTHENBURG'S MEDICINDATA. ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE GREATLY
INFLUENCED BY THE ONGOING CHANGES IN THE LONG DISTANCE TELECOMMUNICATION
NETWORK AVAILABLE IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES.

THE POSITION OF THE BOOK IN FINLAND.
     
FINLAND HAS PROPORTIONATELY A VERY LARGE NATIONAL BOOK PRODUCTION (710 VOLUMES
PER MILLION POPULATION IN 1970, AS AGAINST 280 IN USA). BOOK LOANS/SALES HAVE
INCREASED FROM 17.4/4.9 PER HEAD IN 1950 TO 32.4/13.6 IN 1970, WHILE THE
PROPORTION OF FICTION PUBLISHED FELL FROM ONE-THIRD TO 10-15%. LIBRARY LOANS
INCREASED SEVENFOLD DURING 1945-70, WHILE BORROWERS INCREASED FROM 8% TO 26%
OF POPULATION. THE FIRST MOBILE LIBRARY APPEARED IN 1961; BY 1971 THERE WERE
73, LENDING 8% OF THE NATIONAL TOTAL. BOOK-CLUBS CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS AUTHORS'
ROYALTIES AND GRANTS. FINNISH AUTHORS ARE LESS WELL SUBSIDISED THAN NORWEGIAN,
BUT THEIR BOOKS SELL IN LARGER QUANTITIES.

ATTEMPTS TO HIGHLIGHT ASPECTS OF THE BOOK INDUSTRY INVOLVED IN THE MARKETING
AND DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS TO AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE OPERATIONS OF
PUBLISHERS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARY
SUPPLIERS. SUCCESSFUL AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY SUPPLIERS MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY
LOCAL BOOK SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS BENEFICIAL TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY MARKET, AND
BYPASS THOSE WHICH DO NOT MEET LIBRARY REQUIREMENTS.
FILM RECORD-A RECORD SHEET FOR CURRENT PHOTOGRAPHY.
     
DESCRIBES A FILM RECORD SHEET (DESIGNED BY THE AUTHOR) TO BE COMPLETED BY THE
PHOTOGRAPHER AFTER THE FILM HAS BEEN PROCESSED. EACH ROLL OF FILM IS THE
SUBJECT OF A RECORD SHEET GIVING DETAILS OF CAMERA, LENS AND OTHER TECHNICAL

PROCESSOR/MICRO-/MINI-COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFORM TAKE OFF?.
     
DESCRIBES THE BENEFITS TO BE HAD BY PRODUCING MICROFORMS DIRECT FROM WORD
PROCESSOR OR MINI/MICRO-COMPUTER OUTPUT WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY PAPER
INTERMEDIARY. HOWEVER, WHILE COM RECORDERS CAN ACCEPT THE MAGNETIC TAPE OUTPUT
OF MOST MAINFRAME COMPUTERS, FEW COM RECORDERS CAN ACCEPT FLOPPY DISCS DIRECT
AND THOSE THAT CAN WILL ONLY ACCEPT IBM FORMATTED FLOPPY DISCS. THE ARTICLE
GOES ON TO REVIEW THE VARIOUS METHODS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED TO PRODUCE
WORD PROCESSING OUTPUT MICROFORM AND DESCRIBES THE WORK THAT NRCD IS DOING IN
THIS AREA.
A NEW ARTS COUNCIL FOR QUEBEC.
     
THE TEXT OF A MEMOIR JOINTLY PRESENTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF CANADA ON
1 MAY 81, BY THE QUEBEC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, THE NORTH AMERICAN FRENCH
LANGUAGE PUBLISHERS GROUP, AND THE QUEBEC WRITERS UNION, SETTING OUT THEIR
VIEWS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERATURE IN CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THEIR ROLE
TO DATE IN UPHOLDING THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING AND
COMMUNICATING LITERATURE IN FRENCH. AN APPEAL FOR STATE AID IS PRESENTED ON
THE GROUNDS OF THE NECESSITY FOR A CENTRAL ORGANISM TO MEDIATE BETWEEN
NATIONAL AND LOCAL INTERESTS IN SUPPORTING MINORITY CULTURE, AND THE
OBJECTIVES OF A NATIONAL CULTURAL POLICY ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED.
LEXICOGRAPHY' AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF DICTIONARIES.
     
PRESENTS A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE DICTIONARY INCORPORATING BOTH FORM AND
CONTENT BY USING A TYPOLOGY WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT EQUALLY OF THE PURPOSE AND
LINGUISTIC SCOPE OF EACH TYPE. THE STRUCTURE OF THE DICTIONARY ENTRY AND THE
PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, AND A COMPARISON MADE WITH THE
THESAURUS. FINALLY THE THESAURUS IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE LANGUAGE OF
THESAURI, AS USED IN INFORMATICS TO SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBJECT AND
KEYWORD. CONCLUDES THAT THEORETICAL STUDIES ABOUT THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION
SHOULD BE BASED ON SEMANTICS.
MODE OF REFERENCE AND ITS ROLE IN SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCES.
     
CONCEIVES A MODE OF REFERENCE AS A GENERALISATION OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS USED BY LINGUISTS AND LOGICIANS IN DESCRIBING RELATIONS BETWEEN
LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS AND NON-LINGUISTIC REALITY (SUCH AS TERM, PREDICATE,
REFERENTIALITY). PROPOSES A CALCULUS FOR THE MODE OF REFERENCE OF A RUSSIAN
NOUN PHRASE, BASED ON THE SET OF FEATURES OF A NOUN PHRASE WHICH EXHAUSTIVELY
CHARACTERISE ITS MODE OF REFERENCE. EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF THE MODE ON THE
PHRASE'S SYNTACTIC AND ANAPHORIC PROPERTIES AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF
INDICATING THE MODE OF A NOUN PHRASE IN SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF SENTENCES.
SOME CLASS OF MERGING ALGORITHMS.
     
A GENERALISED MODEL OF MERGING ALGORITHMS OF THE +N-TH ORDER, USING THE
CONCEPT OF A BINARY TREE, IS CONSIDERED.
ACS COMMITTEE ON NOMENCLATURE' ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1980.
     
NOMENCLATURE COMMITTEES, BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL, WERE VERY ACTIVE IN
1980, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS. A SUMMARY OF
THE MORE IMPORTANT MEETINGS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOLLOWS.
PRESENT STATUS OF INORGANIC CHEMICAL NOMENCLATURE.
     
A SYSTEMATIC CHEMICAL NAME IS ONE WHICH PORTRAYS THE ESSENTIAL STRUCTURAL
FEATURES OF A CHEMICAL COMPOUND BY SOME GENERAL PATTERN. FOR MOST PURPOSES IT
IS UNNECESSARY TO WRITE NOMENCLATURE RULES IN SUCH DETAIL AS TO PROVIDE A
SINGLE NAME FOR EACH COMPOUND. LIKE ALL HUMAN ACTIVITIES NOMENCLATURE PATTERNS
CHANGE WITH TIME. THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET NEW CONDITIONS, TO SECURE GREATER
GENERALITY, OR TO OBTAIN SIMPLER NAMES. WHILE NOMENCLATURE SPECIALISTS MUST BE
ATTUNED TO THE NEEDS OF NOMENCLATURE USERS, THEIR SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS TO BE
SUCCESSFUL MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE USERS. THE PRESENTATION DETAILS WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY (1) THE COMMITTEE-COMMISSION
STRUCTURE IN THIS COUNTRY AND INTERNATIONALLY, (2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
IN THE PAST HALF-CENTURY, (3) DEVELOPMENTS IN PROGRESS, AND (4) AREAS WHERE
NOMENCLATURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE NEEDED.

THE FATE OF PATENTS PUBLISHED IN THE UK DURING 1951-61. STUDIES HOW MUCH
COMPANIES VARY IN THEIR PATENTING POLICY; WHETHER THIS CORRELATES WITH THEIR
PROFITABILITY; AND THE AMOUNT OF LICENSING BETWEEN COMPANIES.
THE DIARY OF THE HUMAN RACE: LIBRARIES IN A TROUBLED AGE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. LIBRARIES ARE AN INDEX TO THE CULTURE WITHIN WHICH THEY
EXIST-PROVIDING A REPOSITORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED, IMAGINED OR HOPED,
AND SERVING AS ARENAS WITHIN WHICH PEOPLE CAN GRAPPLE WITH PRESENT TASKS AND
ATTEMPT TO COPE WITH THE FUTURE. PRESENTS A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW OF THE US
LIBRARY'S ROLE IN CULTURAL LIFE, AND HIGHLIGHTS PRESENT AND LIKELY FUTURE
DIFFICULTIES IN MEETING THAT GOAL, AS LIBRARIES ARE FACED WITH INFLATIONARY
PRESSURES, THE PUBLIC'S INCREASING USE OF TELEVISION INSTEAD OF BOOKS, AND
HIGHER LABOUR COSTS.
LIBRARIES AND THE TWO CULTURES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. CULTURE MAY MEAN AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE BEST THAT HAS
BEEN KNOWN AND SAID IN THE WORLD, AND THE WHOLE CONGERIES OF WAYS IN WHICH A
PARTICULAR PEOPLE CONSTRUCT BUILDINGS, MANUFACTURE ARTIFACTS, WORSHIP DEITIES,
MAKE WAR AND LOVE, RAISE CHILDREN, AND LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER. TRACES THE
HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE 2 CULTURES, CONTENDING THAT
THE MAKEUP OF SOCIETIES AND CULTURES THAT ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD IS NOT
MUCH INFLUENCED BY THE SMALL NUMBER WHO SEEK CULTURE, AND LIBRARIES REMAIN
PERIPHERAL IN THE CULTURE OF THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE.
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND AMERICAN MODERNIZATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. A SIGNIFICANT HISTORIOGRAPHICAL SHIFT HAS TAKEN PLACE
AMONG CULTURAL HISTORIANS WITHIN THE LAST 2 DECADES, AND A MORE COMBATIVE AND
CRITICAL STANCE TOWARD US INSTITUTIONS IS APPARENT, WHICH SERVES AS A BRIDGE
FOR THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DEBATE TO ENTER THE LARGER ARENA. IDENTIFIES AND
ACCOUNTS FOR THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL CHANGE, RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS
CONCLUSIONS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO MODERNISATION. ALSO REFLECTS UPON THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN HISTORY AND CONTEMPORARY POLICY DEBATES.
ANCIENT BURIALS OF METAL DOCUMENTS IN STONE BOXES-THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR
LIBRARY HISTORY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGS HAVE UNEARTHED MANY BARREL CYLINDERS,
STONE OR METAL TABLETS AND OTHER ARTEFACTS ON WHICH WERE INSCRIBED A PERMANENT
RECORD OF THE LABOURS OF PARTICULAR SOCIETIES. DESCRIBES SOME OF THE MAJOR
FINDINGS AT PERSEPOLIS AND ELSEWHERE. THE HISTORY OF BOOKS AND LIBRARIES IS
THE HISTORY OF 2INSTRUMENTS, 1AND THUS THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF THE ANCIENT
NEAR EAST ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP; ANCIENT
RECORDS COME NOT IN SINGLE BOOKS BUT IN WHOLE LIBRARIES-ORGANIC ENTITIES
REPRESENTING EVERY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, OF OBVIOUS SIGNIFICANCE TO
THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
METHODS OF REFERENCE IN CASSIODORUS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. THE 2PSALM COMMENTARY, 1BY THE 6TH-CENTURY LATIN CHURCH
FATHER, CASSIODORUS, USED A TYPE OF FORMAT CREATED BY THE AUTHOR HIMSELF-ONE
NEVER TO BE USED AGAIN IN THE HISTORY OF THE MEDIAEVAL BOOK. SHOWS HOW,
THROUGH THE ORGANISATION OF THE BOOK AND BY THE USE OF MARGINAL SYMBOLS,
CASSIODORUS WAS ABLE TO PRESENT TO HIS STUDENTS A HANDBOOK FROM WHICH THEY
COULD LEARN THE RUDIMENTS OF THE LIBERAL ARTS THROUGH THE STUDY OF DIVINE
SCRIPTURE. THE BOOK CONSTITUTES A SELF-HELP MANUAL, WITH THE NARRATOR SPEAKING
DIRECTLY TO THE READER. CRITICAL MARKS WERE ADDED TO SPECIFIC PLACES IN THE
TEXT TO ALLOW THE READER TO STUDY WHATEVER HE WANTS IN THE TEXT, SIMPLY BY
LOCATING LIKE SYMBOLS.
STOIC INFLUENCES IN LIBRARIANSHIP: A CRITIQUE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. EXPRESSES A DEEP INDEBTEDNESS BY LIBRARIANS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS TO THE THOUGHT AND CULTURE OF ANCIENT GREECE, BUT
SOUNDS A WARNING TO INFORMATION SCIENTISTS THAT SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED
FROM THE GREEKS ARE BEING BLINDLY AND UNTHINKINGLY MISAPPLIED TODAY, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF CLEAR THINKING ABOUT LIBRARY PROBLEMS. DESCRIBES THE ANCIENT
GREEK THEORY OF THE SIGN EXPRESSING THE RELATION BETWEEN WORDS, THOUGHTS, AND
THINGS WHICH IS STILL INFLUENTIAL IN PHILOSOPHY, LINGUISTICS, AND PSYCHOLOGY,
BUT IS OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY INVOKED IN THESE DISCIPLINES AND IN LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE AND THE STUDY OF COMMUNICATION. THE MODEL IS AMBIGUOUS,
AND SO AN ALTERNATIVE, BASED ON HUMAN LINGUISTICS, IS PROPOSED.
AN IDEA OF LIBRARIANSHIP: AN OUTLINE FOR A ROOT-METAPHOR THEORY IN LIBRARY
SCIENCE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. WITH GROWTH COMES COMPLEXITY; AND LIBRARIANSHIP BECOMES
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS IT GROWS. A 2-FOLD APPROACH TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF
LIBRARIANSHIP IS SUGGESTED. FIRSTLY, LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A
GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE STUDIED AS A WHOLE, AND
SECONDLY, BASIC COMPONENTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED, BY REDUCING
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FIELD TO ITS SIMPLEST PARTS-ITS 'ROOTS'. PROPOSES A
MODEL OF 'METALIBRARIANSHIP' BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, AND INVOLVING ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT ITS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM, EXPANDED CONTEXTUALISM AND
FORMISM, AND SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIMARY ROOT METAPHOR OF METALIBRARIANSHIP IS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GENERIC BOOK, ITS SUBJECT MATTER, AND ITS READER.

COUNTRIES AS REFLECTED IN THE WRITINGS OF SOVIET LIBRARIANS. CONTRIBUTIONS
FROM 1920S AND 1930S REVEAL NOT ONLY CRITICISM OF THE WESTERN LIBRARY THEORIES
BUT ALSO APPRECIATION OF PRACTICAL ACHIEVEMENTS. INCONSISTENCY OF THEORY
(NON-POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF LIBRARIES) WITH PRACTICE (MIDDLE CLASS BIAS OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES) WAS 1 OF THE MAIN AREAS OF CRITICISM IN THE 1940S AND 1950S.
1960S BROUGHT WIDER INTEREST IN SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE CURRENT INTEREST IS THE INFLUENCE OF WESTERN
LIBRARIANSHIP ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

CONSOLIDATING AND ADVANCING THE INTERESTS OF THE PROFESSION, INCLUDING THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, INTEGRATION OF TEACHING PROGRAMMES,
AND IMPROVEMENTS IN BUDGET ALLOCATION. RECENT GOVERNMENT MEASURES ARE
DISCUSSED AS EVIDENCE OF WIDER PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE
IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES, AND IN CONCLUSION URGES
LIBRARIANS TO CAPITALISE ON THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES NOW OPENING UP.
AFRICAN LIBRARIES. WESTERN TRADITION AND COLONIAL BRAINWASHING.

THIRTY YEARS OF THE 2BIBLIOTEKAR1.
     
A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ALMOST 30 YEARS OF 2BIBLIOTEKAR'S 1HISTORY.
INADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAVE MEANT THAT AUTHORS FEES ARE NOT GENEROUS,
AND THE QUALITY OF THE PUBLISHED MATERIAL SUFFERS. IT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO
IMPROVE THE JOURNAL'S LAYOUT, ALTHOUGH THE PRINTING FACILITIES AT THE CYRIL
AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY ARE GRATEFULLY APPRECIATED. CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS
SHOULD IMPROVE 2BIBLIOTEKAR'S 1QUALITY AND IMAGE, E.G. ARTICLES SHOULD BE
PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE BY THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY AND OTHER
MAJOR LIBRARIES. FREELANCE CORRESPONDENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SHOULD REPORT
REGULARLY ABOUT LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS. OTHER FREELANCE COLLABORATORS,
WITH A GOOD COMMAND OF MODERN LANGUAGES, SHOULD PROVIDE REVIEWS OF FOREIGN
PERIODICALS ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND DESIGNATE ARTICLES WORTHY OF FULL TRANSLATION
INTO BULGARIAN. A SPECIAL COMMISSION SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO SPECIFY
2BIBLIOTEKAR'S1 STATUTE WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION AS THE ONLY
JOURNAL CATERING FOR ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA.
ZZZZ.
     
FORMERLY 2LIBRARY COMPUTER EQUIPMENT REVIEW1, THE NEW TITLE REFLECTS THE FACT
THAT INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE JOURNAL IS OF INTEREST TO A WIDE RANGE OF
INFORMATION PROCESSING AGENCIES AND SPECIALTIES AND NOT JUST TO LIBRARIES.
ZZZZ.
     
THE CHANGE IN TITLE FROM 2JOURNAL OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION1 TO 2INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES1 REFLECTS THE BROADENING OF THE FIELDS OF INFORMATION
SCIENCE AND LIBRARY AUTOMATION TO ENCOMPASS OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND
APPLICATIONS.

CANADIAN TEACHER AND PHYSICIAN, AS A BOOK COLLECTOR AND BENEFACTOR OF
LIBRARIES, AND FOCUSES ON OSLER AS A BIBLIOGRAPHER.
THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE ADVENT OF DATA PROCESSING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE HAS IMPROVED THE
STANDING OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A PROFESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME CREATED A
DEMAND FOR BETTER QUALIFICATIONS, ESPECIALLY GRADUATE ENTRY. LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN PUTTING PRESSURE ON LOCAL AND
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF THEIR MEMBERS. THIS STATUS VARIES
CONSIDERABLY FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL TREND IS UPWARDS,
AND FROM 1 KIND OF LIBRARY TO ANOTHER. IN SOME UNIVERSITIES, LIBRARIANS ENJOY
FULL ACADEMIC STATUS, BUT A LIBRARIAN MUST BE MORE THAN A PURE ACADEMIC AND
MUST BE PROFICIENT IN THE PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS AS WELL.
THE FUTURE COURSE OF ARCHIVAL THEORY IN THE UNITED STATES.
     
ARCHIVISTS WISHING TO PURSUE THE CONCEPT OF ARCHIVAL THEORY MUST FIRST DEFINE
THAT CONCEPT AND THEN WEIGH THEIR DEFINITION AGAINST THE WORK DONE IN THE
FIELD SO FAR. ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THEORY AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
UNIVERSAL LAWS, AND TO FRAME HYPOTHESES IN UNIVERSAL FORM AND TEST THEM
AGAINST THE EVIDENCE. ADDRESSES THE LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN US ARCHIVAL THEORY
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE PROFESSION IF'
(1) THE PROFESSION ITSELF REALISES THAT IT IS BOTH A SCIENCE AND A CRAFT; AND
(2) CERTAIN ARCHIVISTS MAKE THE MOVE FROM THE WORKPLACE TO THE ACADEMY AS A
PERMANENT CAREER COMMITMENT. THERE THEY MUST REALIGN THEMSELVES WITH ACADEMIC
HISTORIANS AND OTHERS TO PRODUCE A BODY OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, A SYSTEM OF
IMMUTABLE LAWS-A LITANY OF THEORY AND DOGMA.
PROLEGOMENA TO AN AUSTRALIAN CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS FOR LIBRARIANS.
     
THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS PAPER WAS DELIVERED AS AN ADDRESS AT THE SPRING FESTIVAL
DINNER OF THE ACT BRANCH OF THE LAA, 25 SEPT 81. EXAMINES CRITICALLY THE CODES
OF ETHICS FOR LIBRARIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE USA AND THE UK, AND
DISCUSSES A NUMBER OF POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION WHEN DRAWING UP SUCH A CODE FOR
AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES. CONSIDERS THE ISSUES THAT GIVE RISE TO QUESTIONS OF
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS-IN PARTICULAR LITERATURE CONTROLS (CENSORSHIP) AND THE
CLIENT'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY (FREEDOM TO READ). ARGUES THAT SUCH A CODE SHOULD BE
PRECISE AND CLEAR AND TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE FACT THAT LIBRARIANS DISPOSE OF A
LOT OF POWER.
PRAGMATIC ASPECTS OF INQUIRY.
     
(PHD DISSERTATION-UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY). AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE SOME
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH PEOPLE SEARCH FOR INFORMATION
WHICH THEY KNOW OR BELIEVE TO EXIST. ANALYSES LANGUAGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A SEMANTIC THEORY THAT WOULD HELP EXPLAIN THE PROCESS OF INQUIRY; DEMONSTRATES
THAT EVEN SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD USES OF LANGUAGE AS AUTHORS' NAMES AND
CITATIONS ARE VERY COMPLEX LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA; ANALYSES GENERAL METHODS USED
IN THE CONDUCT OF INQUIRY; AND IDENTIFIES AND CONSIDERS THE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES
OF THE PRAGMATIC THEORY OF INQUIRY.
ON THE OCCASION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FRENCH LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION
(ABF)' A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW.
     
A SURVEY PREPARED FOR THE 1981 CONFERENCE, DESCRIBING THE ORIGINAL
ORGANISATION OF THE ASSOCIATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES FRANCAIS (ABF) AND ITS
SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT AND ACHIEVEMENTS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HOW THE
PROFESSION WAS FIRST ORGANISED, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMMES,
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALIST SECTIONS WITHIN THE ABF. THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, THE
ABF HAS CONSISTENTLY STRIVEN TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDERS.
WILLIAM C. MILNER AND MARITIME LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES THE FORMATIVE YEARS OF CANADA'S MARITIME LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND ITS
EFFORTS TO ORGANISE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE MARITIME STATES 1918-24.
CONCENTRATES ON THE WORK OF ITS 2ND PRESIDENT WILLIAM C. MILNER, WHO
ULTIMATELY FAILED TO ESTABLISH LIBRARIES IN NOVA SCOTIA OR NEW BRUNSWICK.
REASONS FOR THE FAILURE WERE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGH SOME
REASONS WERE DUE TO MILNER HIMSELF.
THE ROLE OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN EDUCATION, STANDARDS AND OTHER
SUPPORT SERVICES FOR MEMBERS.
     
EMPHASISES THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN THE
EXCHANGE OF MATERIALS AMONG MEDICAL LIBRARIES, THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION OF
IMPORTANCE TO THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF MEDICAL LIBRARIES, THE EDUCATION OF
MEDICAL AND MEDICAL-RELATED LIBRARIANS AND DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS AND
GUIDELINES. POSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO EACH OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND
ROLES.
THE ROLE OF THE PERSATUAN PERPUSTAKAAN MALAYSIA (LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF
MALAYSIA) IN PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IN MALAYSIA.
     
(MA DISSERTATION). THE PERSATUAN PERPUSTAKAAN MALAYSIA (PPM) WAS INAUGURATED
ON 25 MAR 55 AS THE MALAYAN LIBRARY GROUP, AND IT MARKED THE EARLIEST ATTEMPT
TO FORM AN ASSOCIATION BY LIBRARIANS IN MALAYSIA (THEN MALAYA) AND SINGAPORE.
PPM HAS ASSUMED THE ROLE OF THE LEADER OF THE MALAYSIAN LIBRARY PROFESSION.
EXAMINES THE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP, QUESTIONING ITS EFFICACY AND
PROFESSIONALISM. ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE
LIBRARY PROFESSION VIS-A-VIS THE ROLE WHICH PPM CAN PLAY.
THREE PIOUS HOPES.
     
GREETING OF THE INCOMING PRESIDENT TO THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS AT
THEIR 44TH ANNUAL MEETING, CINCINNATI, OHIO, 3 OCT 80, EXPRESSING 3 'PIOUS
HOPES': (1) THAT MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY WILL VOICE THEIR FEELINGS STRONGLY TO
COUNCIL AND OFFICERS; (2) THAT THE SOCIETY CAN THINK CONSTRUCTIVELY ABOUT THE
ROLES OF THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND ELECTED OFFICERS; AND (3) THAT ATTENDANCE
WILL BE GOOD AT THE SOCIETY'S NEXT ANNUAL MEETING IN BERKELEY.
ON THE PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF THE LIBRARIAN FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF EDUCATION
AND TRAINING.
     
SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEMS AIM TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE PEOPLE
IN ALL SUBJECTS, TO PROVIDE SOUND COMMUNIST TRAINING AND TO SUPPORT THE
FURTHER GROWTH OF SOCIALIST SOCIETY. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
MUST, THEREFORE, BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE OBJECTIVES. THE LIBRARIAN HAS A
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING DEMAND FOR LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION, TO FURTHER RESEARCH STUDY AND TO SUPPORT SOCIALIST EDUCATION.
WHATEVER BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK THE STUDENT WILL EVENTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN,
TRAINING SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO LEARNING FACTS AND LIBRARY METHODOLOGY
TECHNIQUES BUT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE TRAINING IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC
ASPECTS OF LIBRARY WORK. A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELATE HIS PARTICULAR
SOCIAL ROLE IN HIS BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK TO THE SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A
WHOLE.
TAKING THE LIBRARY OUT OF LIBRARY EDUCATION.
     
LACK OF STATUS IS AN OLD PROBLEM FOR LIBRARIANS, BUT ADOPTING THE NAME OF
INFORMATION MANAGER AND SWITCHING TO INDUSTRY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A
SOLUTION. SUGGESTS THAT EXTENDING LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES TO 2 YEARS MAY
HELP US LIBRARY SCHOOLS TO SURVIVE. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS IN THE RELEVANCE OF
CURRICULA AND MORAL VALUES OF THE PROFESSION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
TECHNOLOGIES.

LIBRARIANSHIP WILL BE MY VOCATION.
     
DISCUSSES LIBRARIANSHIP EDUCATION ON SECONDARY SCHOOL LEVEL. THE 1ST PART IS
AN ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF AN ENQUIRY, CARRIED OUT AMONG 4TH YEAR STUDENTS
OF ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS, AS TO STUDENTS' MOTIVATION, INFORMATION PROVIDED TO
THEM ON WHICH THEY BASED THEIR DECISION TO SELECT THIS VOCATION, WHICH BRANCH
OF LIBRARIANSHIP THEY ARE INTERESTED IN, AND HOW THEY ASSESS THEIR 4 YEAR
COURSE. THE NEXT PART DEALS WITH PRACTICAL WORK IN LIBRARIES IN WHICH THE 4TH
YEAR STUDENTS TAKE PART. THE COURSE IS COMPLETED BY FINAL EXAMINATIONS WHICH
COUNT AS EQUIVALENT TO FINAL EXAMS AT AN ORDINARY SECONDARY SCHOOL.
SOME COMMENTS ON THE CURRICULUM OF THE BASIC BRANCH OF STUDY-LIBRARY SCIENCE,
INTRAMURAL STUDY.
     
THE INTRAMURAL COURSE OF STUDY AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN LEADING TO
A DEGREE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE PROVIDES FUTURE LIBRARIANS WITH SCIENTIFICALLY
BASED KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD PRACTICAL CAREER TRAINING. A STUDENT FOLLOWS COURSES
IN SUBJECTS RELATED TO LIBRARY SCIENCE, MARXISM AND LENINISM, AND FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, RUSSIAN, ENGLISH AND FRENCH. SEVERAL PRACTICAL WORK PERIODS SPENT
IN DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES MAKE UP PART OF THE COURSE.
LIBRARIAN STUDENTS ALSO ATTEND COURSES IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS INFORMATION
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MODERN MEDIA TO ENABLE THEM TO FOLLOW FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE FIELDS AFFECTING THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE COURSE OF STUDY
LASTS 8 TERMS, THE LAST OF WHICH IS SPENT IN A LIBRARY DOING PRACTICAL WORK
AND RESEARCHING FOR A THESIS FOR THE FINAL EXAMINATION. THE TITLE AWARDED TO
LIBRARIANS ON PASSING THE FINALS IS DIPLOMBIBLIOTHEKAR (DIPLOMA LIBRARIAN).
THE CO URSE ALSO TRIES TO STIMULATE STUDENTS TO INDEPENDENT STUDY WHILE AT
UNIVERSITY AND TO EXPAND THEIR KNOWLEDGE CONTINUOUSLY IN THEIR FUTURE CAREERS.
TEACHING LIBRARY SCIENCE. THE UNIVERSITY OF COLOGNE PROGRAMME.
     
TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 SEMINAR IN WARSAW BY THE PROFESSOR
OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT COLOGNE, THE 1ST GERMAN UNIVERSITY TO INCORPORATE A
SPECIFIC PROGRAMME OF STUDY FOR THE SUBJECT INTO ITS CURRICULA. FOR THE
PURPOSE OF INSTRUCTION, THE FIELD OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IS DIVIDED INTO 5
COMPONENTS' LIBRARY THEORY, GENERAL LIBRARIANSHIP, LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY, LIBRARY
HISTORY, AND FORMS OF PUBLICATION AND MATERIALS USED FOR PUBLISHING. THE
CONTENT AND STRUCTURAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THESE AREAS ARE DELINEATED, AND DETAILS
GIVEN OF THE VARIOUS DEGREES AND ELECTIVE PROGRAMMES OFFERED, TOGETHER WITH
THE CORRESPONDING UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS. THE PROGRAMME IS SUGGESTED AS A
MODEL FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE TEACHING IN GERMANY AND OTHER COUNTRIES. FOR
COMPARISON THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS COMPRISING THE BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE
PROGRAMME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE APPENDED.
ON SOME THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHY WITHIN
THE INTRAMURAL COURSE OF STUDY IN LIBRARY SCIENCE.
     
SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHY IS DIVIDED INTO 7 THEMATIC GROUPS' THEORETICAL
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; ORGANISATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
LITERATURE INFORMATION AND METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ACTIVITY; HISTORIC
DEVELOPMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT
LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF RECOMMENDATORY BIBLIOGRAPHY
IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR; AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY. THESE 7 THEMES
ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND INTERSECT IN MANY AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY, WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES OTHER THEMES. THE COURSE
IN BIBLIOGRAPHY IS A BALANCED MIXTURE OF THEORY AND PRACTICE. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE EDUCATED TO THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF BIBLIOGRAPHY AS IT
EXISTS IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR. THE TIME ALLOTTED TO THE COURSE IS NOT
ADEQUATE AND STUDENTS HAVE TO STUDY INDEPENDEN TLY WHICH REQUIRES A GOOD
KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES AS MUCH OF THE COURSE LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN AND
ENGLISH.

ARCHIVAL TRAINING IN EUROPE.
     
OVERVIEW OF ARCHIVAL TRAINING IN EUROPE PRESENTING A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON US
PRACTICE. THE VERY ANTIQUITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARCHIVAL PROFESSION HAS SEEN ITS
CONSTANT TRANSFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL
CONDITIONS. EUROPEANS, MORE THAN AMERICANS, TRADITIONALLY STRESSED THE
ARCHIVIST'S DUAL RESPONSIBILITY AS CUSTODIAN AND INTERPRETER OF THE HISTORICAL
RECORD. AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS SHOULD NOT SLAVISHLY IMITATE THE PRACTICES OF
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BUT RATHER GARNER THE INSIGHTS BROADER THAN AN EXCLUSIVELY
AMERICAN-ORIENTED DISCUSSION CAN PROVIDE.
TEACHING THE USE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES (TUIR) AND THE SCHOOLS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
REPLIES TO A SHORT QUESTIONNAIRE SENT TO 18 UK LIBRARY SCHOOLS INDICATE THAT
MOST INCLUDE SHORT OR LONG UNITS ON TEACHING THE USE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES
(TUIR), OR INTEGRATE TUIR INTO BROADER SUBJECT AREAS. NOTES ARGUMENTS FOR AND
AGAINST TUIR. THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT MAY LIE IN THE WIDER AREA OF COOPERATION
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT LEARNING SKILLS.
WORKSHOP ON NEW TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARY/INFORMATION SCIENCE EDUCATION,
NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE POLYTECHNIC, 13-16 APRIL 1981.
     
SESSIONS COVERED THE ASPECTS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO BE INCLUDED IN THE
SYLLABUS, PRESTEL AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, STAFF DEVELOPMENT
AND COURSE ORGANISATION AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION. REVIEWS
THE WORK OF THE MICROELECTRONICS EDUCATION PROGRAMME AND ITS CENTRE IN
PROVIDING FOR THE FAMILIARISATION OF SCHOOLCHILDREN WITH COMPUTER TECHNIQUES.
THE NEW TEACHING LIBRARY.
     
ARGUES THAT TECHNICAL SERVICES HAVE BECOME THE PIVOT OF CHANGE IN US
LIBRARIES, AND THAT BECAUSE OF THIS, A NEW LEVEL OF LIBRARY EDUCATION IN
TECHNICAL SERVICES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL IS URGENTLY NEEDED. SUGGESTS A
NEW APPROACH TO TEACHING WHICH WOULD INVOLVE' THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING
LIBRARIES; THE MERGER OF LIBRARY AND LIBRARY SCHOOL ORGANISATION; AND THE
NURTURING OF REALISTIC, GOAL ORIENTATED RESEARCH IN A PRACTICAL SETTING.
IMPORTANT POINTS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE TRAINING IN THE FIELD OF COLLECTION
SCIENCE.
     
COLLECTION SCIENCE FORMS PART OF THE SUBJECT GROUP COLLECTIONS/CATALOGUES IN
THE STUDY COURSE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN. THE
SUBJECT GROUP IS STUDIED IN THE 2ND YEAR AND ORAL EXAMINATIONS IN THESE
SUBJECTS TAKE PLACE AT THE END OF THE 4TH AND 6TH SEMESTER. COLLECTION SCIENCE
PROVIDES KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING LIBRARY COLLECTIONS, THEIR ORGANISATION AND
MAINTENANCE. THE MAIN SUBJECT DIVISIONS ARE' HISTORY OF COLLECTIONS; THEORY OF
COLLECTIONS; ACQUISITION OF COLLECTIONS; REVISION OF COLLECTIONS; AND CARE AND
MAINTENANCE OF COLLECTIONS. THE HISTORY OF COLLECTIONS CONCENTRATES ON GERMAN
LIBRARY HISTORY FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY THEN WORLD WAR II AND
THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLECTION ACQUISITION IN EAST GERMANY UP TO THE PRESENT.
THE CENTRAL SUBJECT OF THE COURSE IS COLLECTION ACQUISITION. STUDENTS STUDY IN
DEPTH THE BASIC ACQUISITION PRINCIPLES OF TYPICAL LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY' A
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, A CENTRAL SCIENCE LIBRARY, A DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY, A
TOWN AND DISTRICT PUBLIC LIBRARY AND A TRADE UNION LIBRARY.
FURNISHING INTRAMURAL STUDENTS WITH KNOWLEDGE, QUALIFICATIONS AND SKILLS IN
THE FIELD OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING.
     
LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION REPRESENTS THE FOUNDATION OF SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUES AND
PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN SUBJECT CATALOGUING. ITS FORM RELATING TO CONTENT
AND IDEOLOGY DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCIENCES AND SOCIETY
WHICH IT REFLECTS. IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY IT FROM AN HISTORICAL POINT OF
VIEW. THROUGH STUDYING THE SUBJECTS LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT
CATALOGUING STUDENTS ARE ENABLED TO UNDERSTAND THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF
LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION AND TO EVALUATE IT FROM A MARXIST-LENINIST POINT OF
VIEW. THIS IS ALSO RELEVANT IN THE CASE OF TERMINOLOGY FOR A SUBJECT CATALOGUE
OR A THESAURUS. STUDENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING
AND FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION FROM THE END OF THE 15TH
CENTURY TO THE PRESENT SITUATION IN EAST GERMANY. THEY ARE MADE AWARE OF THE
NEED TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THE PRESENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS IN EAST GERMANY.
SELECTING AND PROMOTING INFORMATION NETWORKS CURRICULUM AND KEY WORKS.
     
REPORTS A STUDY THAT RESULTED IN A CURRICULUM PARADIGM AND A 31-ITEM LIST OF
KEY SUPPORTING LITERATURE FOR A 1ST GRADUATE COURSE IN INFORMATION NETWORKS.
THE ASSUMPTION UNDERLYING THE STUDY WAS THAT THERE IS A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN CURRICULUM GOALS AND KEY LITERATURE. THE PARADIGM AND LIST WERE
DEVELOPED EMPLOYING THE HEURISTIC METHOD, A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH,
SELECTED TEACHING STRATEGIES, AND OBSERVATIONS OF STUDENT RESPONSES.
SURVEY OF ONLINE SEARCHING INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOLS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE.
     
SUMMARISES THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF ON-LINE SEARCHING EDUCATION AND TRAINING
PRACTICES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. THE MAJOR
OBJECTIVE OF THE SURVEY WAS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING COURSES THAT
COVERED THE USE OF ON-LINE TECHNICAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR REFERENCE
SERVICES, COURSE CONTENT AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSCIOUSNESS RAISING
INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS ADVANCED INSTRUCTION, CONTINUING EDUCATION, PHYSICAL
FACILITIES, AND OPINIONS OF FACULTY REGARDING THE FUTURE OF INSTRUCTION IN
ON-LINE SEARCHING.
SOUND RECORDINGS AS SOURCES OF MUSICAL HISTORY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE IAML ANNUAL CONFERENCE, 1-7 JULY 79, SALZBURG.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON ANALOGIC RECORDING OF ACOUSTICAL PHENOMENA FROM
EDISON'S PHONOGRAPH TO MODERN HI-FI EQUIPMENT. ONLY THOSE SOURCES WHICH OFFER
A RECORDING OF REAL SOUND HAVE THE SAME HISTORICAL STATUS AS WRITTEN OR
PRINTED SOURCES. AS SUCH, THE EDUCATION OF MUSIC HISTORIANS AND MUSIC
LIBRARIANS SHOULD INCLUDE THE SCHOLARLY STUDY AND EVALUATION OF RECORDINGS, SO
THAT STUDENTS MAY LEARN HOW TO DATE RECORDS. ACOUSTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE
PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION AND RECORDING OF SOUND IS INDISPENSABLE KNOWLEDGE FOR
THE MUSICOLOGIST WHO DOES NOT WISH TO IGNORE MUSIC'S MOST IMPORTANT RECENT
SOURCES-RECORDINGS.
ON THE LATER EMPLOYMENT POSSIBILITIES OF GRADUATE LIBRARIANS IN A UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY.
     
OWING TO THE FURTHER EXPANSION IN EAST GERMANY OF STANDARDISED UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES CONSISTING OF A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES IN UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENTS, NEW PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS CONCERNING THE
ORGANISATION, DIRECTION AND PLANNING OF LIBRARY PROCEDURE CORRESPONDING TO THE
EXTENDED FUNCTIONS AND DIMENSIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE INSTITUTE OF
LIBRARY SCIENCE SHOULD ENSURE THAT GRADUATE LIBRARIANS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE
TRAINING TO ALLOW THEM TO COPE WITH THE WORK DEMANDED OF THEM AT UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES. THIS WILL INCLUDE' ALL TYPES OF BOOK PROCESSING; WORK WITH USERS;
PUBLICISING LIBRARY STOCK, ESPECIALLY CULTURAL HERITAGE COLLECTIONS; ACTIVITY
IN HALLS OF RESIDENCE LIBRARIES; COORDINATING WORK BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS
OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY; STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE.
LIBRARY GRADUATES SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE THEORETICAL CONTENT
OF PRACTICA L PROBLEMS AND FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THEM WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT
IN PRACTICE.

SCHOOL LIBRARY-PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
REPORT OF A LECTURE GIVEN TO THE ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, 1981 BY PETER SEEBERG. THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN DENMARK IS REVIEWED AND DOUBTS ARE CAST ON THE GENUINENESS
OF OFFICIAL DANISH LIBERALISM IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ATTITUDE
TO LIBRARIES. SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ORIGINATED FROM 2 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS' IN SCHOOLS CHILDREN HAD OTHERS TO THINK FOR THEM; LIBRARIES IN
DENMARK AROSE FROM THE LATE 19TH CENTURY IDEA OF CULTURE FOR ALL AND ACCESS
FOR ALL TO EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW. BY THE 1930S LIBRARIES HAD BECOME
INSTIGATORS OF CULTURE, WITH LECTURES AS WELL AS BOOKS AVAILABLE, AND WERE
REGARDED AS PROGRESSIVE IN ALL ITS MEANINGS. THIS IS STILL THE AIM OF
LIBRARIES TODAY, BUT SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES HAVE ALWAYS BELONGED TOGETHER AND
INTEGRATION OF THE 2 IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
STATISTICS ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY FOR 1976-80 REVEAL INCREASES IN
STOCKS, LOANS AND USERS. IN 1980 STOCKS TOTALLED OVER 36 MILLION ITEMS, LOANS
OVER 79 MILLION AND READERS OVER 3 MILLION. DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY
SLOWER THAN DURING THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS, PARTLY BECAUSE A HIGH STANDARD HAD
ALREADY BEEN REACHED AND PARTLY BECAUSE MORE ORGANISATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE
REQUIRED. PLANS FOR STOCK EXPANSION HAVE GONE AHEAD BECAUSE THE STATE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S PRODUCTION FIGURES HAVE INCREASED. THE PLANNED TOTAL
STOCK EXPANSION FIGURE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED AND EFFORTS WERE MADE TO KEEP STOCKS
UP TO DATE. TOTAL LIBRARY EXPENDITURE IN 1980 WAS 111,642,600 M, REFLECTING
CONTINUAL INCREASES IN EXPENDITURE.

FRAGMENTS OF A VILLAGE LIBRARIAN'S DIARY: 'POISON' AND ROLLS.
     
DESCRIBES THE LIFE OF A PART-TIME LIBRARIAN IN LOVEL, A VILLAGE WITH A
POPULATION OF 1000, OF WHICH 150 ARE SCHOOLCHILDREN, LYING 10 KM FROM THE CITY
OF VIBORG, JUTLAND. THE LIBRARY, WHICH BEGAN IN THE MID-60S IN 1 OF THE
SCHOOL'S CLASSROOMS, MOVED IN 1979 TO A ROOM OF ITS OWN IN THE NEW SCHOOL. THE
LIBRARY IS OPEN FOR AN HOUR TWICE A WEEK. DESCRIBES THE CLOSE CONTACT WITH
READERS AND PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN ANSWERING THEIR SOMETIMES UNUSUAL REQUESTS.
SERVICES TO THE HOUSEBOUND AND PENSIONERS ARE ARRANGED INFORMALLY AND CARRIED
OUT BY NEIGHBOURLY VISITS. RECALLS ARE MAINLY BY WORD OF MOUTH AND DATES ARE
NOT STRICTLY ADHERED TO.
FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY OF REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
COMPARED WITH 1939, THERE ARE 4 TIMES AS MANY LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA CATERING
FOR 32 TIMES AS MANY READERS. BOOK COLLECTIONS-ALMOST 83 MILLION VOLUMES AT
PRESENT-HAVE INCREASED 34 TIMES. BULGARIA COMES 5TH IN THE WORLD AS TO THE
NUMBER OF BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION. IN SPITE OF THESE ENCOURAGING
STATISTICS, THE STATE CONTROL COMMITTEE MADE AN INVESTIGATION RECENTLY INTO
THE STRUCTURE, ORGANISATION AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN 7 REGIONS.
THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC, SCHOOL AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES VARIED GREATLY.
INHABITANTS ON SOME OF THE NEW HOUSING ESTATES HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED UP TO NOW OF
ANY KIND OF LIBRARY SERVICES. THERE WERE CASES OF HAPHAZARD OPENING AND/OR
CLOSING OF LIBRARIES. THERE IS STILL A LACK OF INFORMATION AND REFERENCE
SERVICES, SHORTAGES IN CONSISTENT CATALOGUING AND PROPER UPKEEP OF RARITIES,
RECOVERY OF OVERDUE BOOKS, AS WELL AS INADEQUATE AUDIO-VISUAL AND REPROGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT. BETTER PLANNING FOR ACQUISITI ONS, AND ALSO MORE CONSIDERATE
DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE ITEMS ARE MOST DESIRABLE. THE COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS WILL
BE PRESENTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER RELEVANT BODIES WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE ACTIVE INTEREST IN LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS, IN
PARTICULAR IN RURAL AREAS.
YEARS OF THE PRAGUE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY.STA
     
TEMENT OF PRESENT AND FUTURE TASKS FACING THE PRAGUE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY. THE
DEPARTMENT FOR POLITICAL LITERATURE IS TAKING CARE OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND
INTENSIFICATION OF READERS SERVICES IN THIS FIELD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FIELD IS
HELP AFFORDED TO SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND NATIONAL ECONOMY. BUT BY FAR THE MOST
DIFFICULT PROBLEM IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EXISTING RESOURCES AND SERVICES
WITH THE AVAILABLE PERSONNEL AND FINANCE.
LIBRARIANSHIP IN HUNGARY, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY SZOMBATHELY.
     
THE TOWN OF SZOMBATHELY HAS A POPULATION OF 85,000. THE CENTRAL AND BRANCH

DONATIONS AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS ARE DESCRIBED AND DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE
LIBRARY'S ADMINISTRATION REPRODUCED. TABLES GIVE BREAKDOWNS OF ITS PRESENT
STOCK AND OF ITS USE BY TEACHERS, STUDENTS AND OTHERS.
HERE THE LIBRARIES ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER.
     
DESCRIBES THE LIBRARIES IN TOMMERUP MUNICIPAL DISTRICT, FUNEN. UNLIKE OTHER
AUTHORITIES AFTER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION IN 1966, TOMMERUP
RETAINED ITS DECENTRALISED STRUCTURE AND STRENGTHENED EACH OF ITS 4 URBAN
CENTRES. THUS THE 4 PART-TIME LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN OR ARE BEING EXPANDED. AT
PRESENT 2 SHARE PREMISES WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIES. EXPENDITURE PER INHABITANT IS
HIGH COMPARED EVEN TO FULL-TIME LIBRARIES. A HIGH STANDARD FOR CULTURAL
ARRANGEMENTS IS SET. INTERVIEWS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE AND THE
CHIEF LIBRARIAN. THE PRESENT PART-TIME LIBRARIANS ARE HIGHLY APPRECIATED,
ALTHOUGH IT IS ENVISAGED THAT A QUALIFIED LIBRARIAN WILL BE EMPLOYED WHEN THE
NEW MAIN LIBRARY IS BUILT IN 1983. A STRONG LOCAL CULTURAL LIFE IS ENCOURAGED.
INCLUDES INTERVIEWS WITH THE LIBRARIANS AT 2 OF THE LIBRARIES AND USERS.
INCLUDES LOAN STATISTICS.
NEW LIFE IN THE OLD VARDE.
     
GIVES A PORTRAIT OF VARDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, DUE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF A NEW MAIN
LIBRARY IN THE CENTRAL TOWN SQUARE. VARDE HAS BEEN IN LIBRARY UNION WITH 2
OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES SINCE 1973, SERVING A TOTAL OF 28,000 INHABITANTS WITH
1 MOBILE AND 10 BRANCH LIBRARIES. THE NEW LIBRARY WILL HAVE 1500 SQ.M. WITH
ROOM FOR EXPANSION, MAKING A MUSIC LIBRARY POSSIBLE EVENTUALLY. INTERVIEWS THE
MAYOR AND CHAIRMAN OF THE UNION LIBRARY, WHO IS PREPARED TO ALLOCATE MORE
MONEY TO THE SERVICE IF DEMAND INCREASES. THE MOBILE LIBRARY HAS BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL IN AREAS TOO SPARSELY POPULATED TO SUSTAIN BRANCHES. PARTY POLITICS
IS FORTUNATELY ABSENT AMONG POLITICIANS DEALING WITH LIBRARIES. THEY MUST,
HOWEVER, HAVE THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY IN BOOK SELECTION, WHILE INTERFERING AS
LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. INTERVIEWS THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN. SINCE THE UNION, SPACE
PROBLEMS HAVE MOUNTED, AND WITH THE NEW LIBRARY, LOANS ARE EXPECTED TO
INCREASE WITHOUT EXTRA ALLOCATION FOR STAFF. WOULD LIKE TO SE E ANOTHER MOBILE
LIBRARY REPLACE SOME OF THE BRANCHES WHICH HAVE FEW LOANS. THE MOBILE LIBRARY
HAS BROUGHT NEW READERS TO THE MAIN LIBRARY. HOWEVER, THE USE OF 1 OF THE
BRANCHES VISITED WAS SUCH THAT A MOBILE LIBRARY COULD NOT REPLACE IT.

THE LIBRARY OF THE LIEPZIG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. STRUCTURE, DEVELOPMENT AND
PRESENT SITUATION.
     
THE LEIPZIG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY WAS FOUNDED IN 1977-80. BEFORE THEN
SEVERAL SMALLER INSTITUTES AND COLLEGES OF ENGINEERING AND RELATED SUBJECTS
EXISTED, ALL WITH SOME KIND OF LIBRARY. THESE LIBRARIES WERE INTEGRATED TO
FORM THE NEW LEIPZIG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY. THE INSTITUTE HAS A
DECENTRALISED STRUCTURE AND THE LIBRARY WAS ORGANISED ON THE SAME LINES. THERE
IS A MAIN LIBRARY WITH 5 DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES, CONCENTRATING PARTICULARLY ON
BUILDING COLLECTIONS FOR POLYGRAPHY AND CIVIL ENGINEERING, BESIDES BEING
RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTIONS OF ALL THE RELATED SUBJECTS. THE LIBRARY PROVIDES
SUPPORT IN TRAINING AND RESEARCH FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF OF THE INSTITUTE AND A
RISE IN LIBRARY USERS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN
EXPANDED, ESPECIALLY WITH SIMILAR INSTITUTES IN THE USSR. AMONG THE PROJECTS
PLANNED FOR 1981 ARE THE FORMATION OF A SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR CIVIL
ENGINEERING AND COLLECTING AND CATALOGUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TRAVEL
AND CONFERENCE REPORTS.

SECTION, LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE,
18-20 AUG 78. THE AIM WAS TO DISCUSS TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION (TAFE)
LIBRARY PROBLEMS, AND TO SUGGEST SOLUTIONS. PAPERS ARE IN 5 SECTIONS'
INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW; MANAGEMENT; EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS; STANDARDS FOR TAFE
LIBRARIES; AND CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS.
CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.
     
THE INSTITUTE OF SEMICONDUCTORS IN BOTEVGRAD HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR 14
YEARS NOW. DURING THAT PERIOD THE LIBRARY HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE
INSTITUTE. THE LIBRARY STAFF OF 2 CATER AT PRESENT FOR 116 RESEARCH WORKERS,
ALL GRADUATES. MANY OF THEM ARE ENGAGED IN POSTGRADUATE STUDIES. AS
SEMICONDUCTORS' TECHNOLOGY IS A HIGHLY SPECIALISED FIELD, THERE ARE ONLY
27,000 VOLUMES IN STOCK, IN RUSSIAN, BULGARIAN, ENGLISH, GERMAN AND OTHER
LANGUAGES. TWICE A MONTH, AN INFORMATION NEWS BULLETIN ON ACQUISITIONS IS
ISSUED, AND AN EFFORT IS MADE TO SECURE ANY REQUIRED ITEM. IN 1980, NEARLY 500
BOOKS, PERIODICALS, STANDARDS, PATENTS, THESES AND OTHER SPECIAL PAPERS WERE
SUPPLIED BY USING INTERLENDING SERVICES OF THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY, THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, AND THE KLIMENT
OKHRIDSKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, ALL IN SOFIA.
BOOK COLLECTING IN COUNTER-REFORMATION ITALY: THE LIBRARY OF GIAN VINCENZO
PINELLI (1535-1601).
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. GIAN VINCENZO PINELLI POSSESSED POSSIBLY THE FINEST
PRIVATE LIBRARY IN ITALY IN THE 2ND HALF OF THE 16TH CENTURY. THE BOOKS WERE
MADE AVAILABLE TO EVERY SERIOUS READER AND SCHOLAR, AND HIS HOME AND LIBRARY
WERE OPENED TO INTELLECTUALS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD. DESCRIBES THE
COLLECTION, METHODS OF COLLECTING, AND THE ULTIMATE FATE OF THE LIBRARY, PART
OF WHICH WAS DESTROYED IN TRANSIT BY TURKISH PIRATES.
THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION.
     
THE ROLE OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S OWN LIBRARY, THE DIVISION OF
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL SERVICES, IN THE FULFILMENT OF THE AMA'S OBJECTIVES IS
DESCRIBED.
ANATOMY OF FAILURE' ONTARIO MECHANICS' INSTITUTES, 1835-1895.
     
DISCUSSES THE RISE AND FALL OF MECHANICS' INSTITUTES IN ONTARIO. THE
INSTITUTES WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR
MECHANICS TO MAKE THEM BETTER WORKERS, BETTER PEOPLE AND BETTER CITIZENS. THEY
FAILED IN THIS LARGELY BECAUSE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED THEM TO PROVIDE
WAS NOT WHAT WAS NEEDED BY THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVED. WORKERS AND
APPRENTICES DID NOT ATTEND CLASSES IN LARGE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBABLY
EXHAUSTED AFTER A 10 OR 11 HOUR DAY. THROUGH LEGISLATION THE INSTITUTES WERE
CONVERTED TO FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
THE MONTREAL MECHANICS' INSTITUTE' 1828-1870.
     
A HISTORY OF THE MONTREAL MECHANICS' INSTITUTE, QUEBEC, THE 1ST INSTITUTION OF
ITS KIND IN BRITISH NORTH AMERICA. THE MONTREAL MECHANICS' INSTITUTION
OPERATED FROM 1828-35 WHEN IT LAPSED DUE TO SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PRESSURES.
REVIEWED IN 1840 AS THE MONTREAL MECHANICS' INSTITUTE, IT CONTINUES TO THIS
DAY AS THE ATWATER LIBRARY OF MONTREAL.
FOUNDER OF THE VATICAN LIBRARY: NICHOLAS V OR SIXTUS VI?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. THE VATICAN LIBRARY CAME INTO BEING DURING THE LAST HALF
OF THE 15TH CENTURY. HISTORIANS CREDIT EITHER POPE NICHOLAS V (1447-1455) OR
POPE SIXTUS IV (1471-1484) WITH ITS ESTABLISHMENT. EXAMINES THE MOTIVES BOTH
POPES HAD TO ESTABLISH THE LIBRARY AND THE ACTIONS THAT THEY TOOK TO BRING IT
ABOUT, QUESTIONING WHETHER THE LIBRARY MIGHT HAVE HAD 2 FOUNDERS WITHIN A
GENERATION.
WHOSE PROBLEM? THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE DISADVANTAGED.
     
INVESTIGATES THE CONCEPT OF DISADVANTAGE IN RELATION TO LIBRARY SERVICE IN
ORDER TO HELP LIBRARIANS TO UNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY THE MEANING OF A TERM
FREQUENTLY USED BUT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. ILLUSTRATES THOSE AREAS WHERE THE
LIBRARY SERVICE IS FAILING AND ATTEMPTS TO SUGGEST REASONS FOR THE FAILURE.
LIBRARY SERVICE FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE' ARENAS, PLAYERS AND STAKES.
     
LIBRARIES ARE 1 OF MANY ARENAS IN WHICH THE RIGHTS OF THE HANDICAPPED ARE
BEING ASSERTED. COLLECTIVELY THEY FORM A MINORITY SIZABLE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY A
PROGRAMME OF SERVICES BUT THE SERVICES MUST DIFFERENTIATE THE NEEDS OF THE
VARIOUS TYPES OF HANDICAP. A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES AND OTHER AGENCIES IS
TACKLING THE PROBLEMS OF INFORMATION POVERTY AND ISOLATION AND ENCOURAGING A
SHIFT FROM ATTITUDES OF PATRONAGE TO THOSE OF CIVIL RIGHTS.
THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE HANDICAPPED AND THE LIBRARIES.
     
LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY PROVIDE MANY SERVICES FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AND
SPECIAL EFFORTS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE SERVICES IN 1981. INCREASED ASSISTANCE
WAS PROVIDED FOR PATIENTS' LIBRARIES AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES IN HOSPITALS,
CLINICS AND SOCIAL WELFARE FACILITIES. THE USE OF BIBLIOTHERAPY FOR TREATING
MENTAL ILLNESS IS INCREASING. PUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCK LARGE PRINT BOOKS
PROVIDED BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND IN LEIPZIG. LIBRARY STAFF AND
VOLUNTEERS VISIT HOUSEBOUND READERS AND SPECIAL FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED IN THE
LIBRARY FOR THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED. PUBLIC LIBRARIES PROVIDE BOOKS FOR USE
IN SHELTERED WORKSHOPS, HOMES, SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND REHABILITATION CENTRES.
SOME HANDICAPPED PEOPLE WORK IN LIBRARIES AS A FORM OF REHABILITATION AND
LIBRARY STAFF ARE GIVEN TRAINING ON THE PROBLEMS OF HANDICAP. COOPERATION
BETWEEN LIBRARIANS AND MEDICAL AUTHORITIES IS ESSENTIAL IN THIS SPHERE.
A LONG WAY TO EQUALITY FOR THE HANDICAPPED.
     
REPORT ON THE 5TH NORDIC SUMMER SCHOOL FOR LIBRARIANS, HELD IN NORWAY ON 22
JULY-7 AUG 81 WITH THE THEME: 'LIBRARY SERVICE TO HANDICAPPED READERS'. THE
FOLLOWING SUBJECTS WERE DEALT WITH' PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH READING; THE
SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF PARTICULAR GROUPS; MATERIALS; TECHNICAL AIDS; PROVISION IN
LIBRARIES; AND COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE SITUATION
IN THE DIFFERENT NORDIC COUNTRIES WAS COMPARED. THE STANDARD OF READING NEEDED
FOR SOCIETY IS LIKELY TO INCREASE, THUS DISTANCING THE HANDICAPPED FURTHER
FROM THE NORMAL POPULATION. THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF THE DEAF, THE MENTALLY
ILL, THE APHASICS, THE BLIND, AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED WERE DISCUSSED.
MATERIALS TO HANDICAPPED READERS WERE DESCRIBED ON THE BASIS OF AN ANALYSIS OF
THE READING SKILL, THE DEFINITION OF AN EASY TEXT, AND THE DIFFERENT NEEDS OF
THE VARIOUSLY HANDICAPPED. THE NEED TO CREATE A BARRIER-FREE LIBRARY BY GOOD
PLANNING AND DESIGN WAS EMPHASISED.
THE PRESENT SITUATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED IN AUSTRALIA.
     
EXPLORES DEFINITIONS OF THE TERM HANDICAPPED, THE RANGE OF SERVICES THOUGHT
DESIRABLE FOR SUCH USERS AND EXISTING STYLES OF SERVICE. RAISES ISSUES
CONNECTED WITH IMPROVING THEIR MANNER AND LEVEL.
FIRST NATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LIBRARIANSHIP FOR HANDICAPPED USERS' PROCEEDINGS.
     
HELD AT MELBOURNE STATE COLLEGE 19-23 MAY 80 WITH THE AIM OF SUPPLEMENTING THE
MINIMAL TRAINING ON THE NEEDS OF HANDICAPPED USERS, POSSIBLE IN FULL TIME
COURSES. FOR ABSTRACTS OF INDIVIDUAL PAPERS 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'-.
EXISTING COLLECTIONS FOR HANDICAPPED USERS.
     
RESULTS OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA 1978 SURVEY 2NATIONAL SERVICES
FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE1 ARE ANALYSED. THE SURVEY FOUND THAT SOME 70% OF PUBLIC

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING PARTY ON LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED
ARE DESCRIBED, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IS DISCUSSED.
USER SERVICES OUTREACH.
     
ILLUSTRATES THE DEMANDS OBSERVED IN A RURAL SETTING AND THE RESPONSES OFFERED
BY THE LIBRARY WITHIN THE RESTRICTIONS OF A TIGHT BUDGET. EMPHASISES THE
INITIATIVES TAKEN TO USE LOCALLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES.
DYSLEXIA.
     
EXPLAINS THE MEANING OF THIS SPECIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE ABILITY TO READ IN ITS
VARIED FORMS, ITS POSSIBLE CAUSES AND HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN SUFFERING
FROM THIS SORT OF DISORDER, AND HOW TO HELP THEM TO SECURE NORMAL EDUCATION.
LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELECT APPROPRIATE READING FOR THEM, E.G. SHORT
STORIES WITH A SIMPLE TEXT, BOOKS WITH WELL DEFINED PRINT, ILLUSTRATIONS ETC.,
AND MAKE THE CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THAT OVERCOMING THEIR DIFFICULTIES IS NOT AN
ACHIEVEMENT IN ITSELF BUT THAT THERE IS A WORTHWHILE STORY ONCE THE
DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN MASTERED.
USER SERVICES OUTREACH.
     
SINCE BUDGETARY CUTS ARE AFFECTING THE PROVISION OF SPECIAL COLLECTIONS IN
TERTIARY EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENTS CENTRALISATION IS CALLED FOR. EMPHASISES THE
NEED FOR COORDINATORS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE DISABLED.
SUGGESTS WAYS OF ENSURING THAT THE DISABLED UNDERSTAND LIBRARY SERVICES AND
HOW TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THEM. PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS, SUCH AS THE PROVISION
OF LIFT KEYS, ARE OFFERED FROM THE WRITER'S OWN EXPERIENCE.
DISABLED LIBRARY USERS AT MONASH UNIVERSITY.
     
ACCOMPANYING PAPER INCLUDED IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP. REPORT OF A
SURVEY UNDERTAKEN AS PART OF PROJECT MIND (MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF
THE DISABLED). THE MIND WORKING PARTY WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THE
DISABLED IN TERTIARY EDUCATION LIBRARIES. QUESTIONNAIRES COVERED SUBJECT
FIELDS, ACADEMIC LEVELS AND THE NATURE OF DISABILITIES AND THE WAY IN WHICH
THEY INTERFERED WITH LIBRARY USE. COMMENTS WERE ALSO SOUGHT ON STAFF
ASSISTANCE, STOCK, EQUIPMENT AND THE LAYOUT OF THE BUILDING.
THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED LIBRARY USER.
     
ABOUT 0.2% OF THE AUSTRALIAN POPULATION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 'LEGALLY BLIND' AND
A FURTHER 1% TO SUFFER IMPAIRMENT SEVERE ENOUGH TO DISABLE THEM IN DAILY
LIVING BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT OF 'LEGAL BLINDNESS'. REVIEWS THE TYPES OF
IMPAIRMENT AND THEIR EFFECTS AND THE AIDS USED TO HELP THE VISUALLY
HANDICAPPED TO OPERATE IN A WORLD DESIGNED FOR NORMAL VISION.
SOME ARE MORE EQUAL..
     
EDITED VERSION OF AN ADDRESS TO THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA VICTORIAN
SCHOOL LIBRARIES SECTIONAL GROUP, MELBOURNE, 10 APR 81. RECORDS THE AUTHOR'S
IMPRESSIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND WALES, GAINED DURING A
RECENT VISIT. DESCRIBES THE BLEAK PROSPECTS FACING THE SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND
WARNS THAT AUSTRALIAN STANDARDS IN THIS AREA MAY WELL BE IN DANGER OF EROSION.
CHILDREN ARE THE LOSERS-THEY DO NOT LEARN THE HABIT OF USING THE LIBRARY.
     
THE REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO THE
ANNUAL MEETING HELD IN OCT 81. WOULD LIKE TO SEE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS
BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE WORK OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND THEIR PLACE IN THE
SCHOOLS. THE TRAINING OF SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AT THE DANISH TEACHERS' HIGH SCHOOL
HAS SUFFERED FROM CUTS AND STANDARDS HAVE BEEN LOWERED. COMMENTS ON THE LATEST
PROPOSAL FOR A LIBRARY BILL AND CRITICISES THE DECISION TO PLACE SCHOOL
LIBRARIES UNDER THE SCHOOLS ACT. IF THEY ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS
ACT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THEIR OWN BY-LAWS STIPULATING COOPERATION WITH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND AN INDEPENDENT BUDGET. THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ALLOW FOR
THESE. DISCUSSES A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE ASSOCIATION AND ARGUES FOR THE
CONTINUED NEED FOR SEPARATE ASSOCIATIONS FOR CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES, BUT WITH CLOSE COOPERATION.
DISTANCE EDUCATION AND THE CIAE LIBRARY, REPORT ON ONE PLANNING SURVEY.
     
EXTERNAL STUDIES PLACE NEW DEMANDS ON COLLEGE LIBRARIES. IN 1978, CAPRICORNIA
INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION (CIAE) WAS FACED WITH DIFFICULTIES IN COPING
WITH DEMANDS FROM EXTERNAL STUDENTS. THE COLLEGE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY, SENDING
QUESTIONNAIRES TO 40 COLLEGES IN AUSTRALIA; THE RESULTS ARE OUTLINED. MAJOR
CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT SERVICES BY COLLEGE LIBRARIES FOR EXTERNAL STUDENTS WERE
VARIED, AND IN AN EMBRYONIC STAGE, AND THERE WAS URGENT NEED FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS FOR LIBRARY SERVICES TO EXTERNAL STUDENTS. MORE
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARIAN AND EXTERNAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT STAFF WAS
NEEDED. THE CONCLUSIONS ENABLED THE CIAE TO REFINE OBJECTIVES AND TO EXPAND
THE CONCEPT OF THE EXTERNAL STUDIES LIBRARY SERVICE. NOTE' THIS ABSTRACT IS A
CORRECTED VERSION OF AN EARLIER ABSTRACT AND REPLACES 80/4299.
WHAT AN IMMIGRANT NEEDS IN THE LIBRARY.
     
EXAMINES THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO DENMARK'S 100,000 IMMIGRANTS. THE 'QUEST
WORKER COLLECTION' IN GENTOFTE LIBRARY, SET UP IN 1970, HAS NOT YET SOLVED THE
PROBLEM OF SELECTION OR ACQUISITION OF SUITABLE MATERIAL. BEST RESULTS HAVE
BEEN ACHIEVED WITH ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN. MEETINGS BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND
IMMIGRANTS COULD IMPROVE SERVICES. INFORMATION TO THE DANES ABOUT IMMIGRANTS
IS VARIED AND SHOULD BE ACQUIRED BY LIBRARIES. BUT THERE IS A LACK OF MATERIAL
IN DANISH ON THE IMMIGRANTS' HOME BACKGROUND AND COOPERATION IS HAMPERED BY
LACK OF IMMIGRANT LEADERS. THE LIBRARY SCHOOL HAS NOT YET TAKEN THE SUBJECT
UP. 2 REPORTS FROM THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE (1973, 1980) COME UP WITH
PROPOSALS, AND AN ETHIOPIAN BORN LIBRARIAN, I. ABDULLAHI, IN HIS 'DESCRIPTION
OF IMMIGRANTS AND LIBRARIES IN DENMARK' (1981), CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE. HE
LISTS THE INFORMATION FROM LIBRARIES WHICH IMMIGRANTS NEED AND SUGGESTS WAYS
OF IMPROVING SERVICES, SOME OF WHICH NEED MO NEY, OTHERS ONLY IMPROVED
PERSONAL EFFORT AND REORGANISATION OF EXISTING WORK.
LIBRARY WORK IS FOR THE USER' THOUGHTS ON THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT OF THE
SUBJECT GROUP ON LIBRARY USE.
     
LIBRARIES IN SOCIALIST SOCIETIES ARE CONSCIOUSLY ORIENTED TOWARDS THE USER.
IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARY WORK CONCERNING LIBRARY USE ARE' THE
CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS; DEVELOPMENT OF AN
AWARENESS OF SOCIAL NEEDS; AND PLANNED STIMULATION OF THE NEED FOR NEW
LITERATURE AND INFORMATION. THE SUBJECT GROUP ON LIBRARY USE SUPPLIES STUDENTS
WITH THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO USE THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ASPECT OF
ENTIRE LIBRARY ACTIVITY AND ADAPT IT TO MEET THE SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE USER.
LIBRARY USE FALLS UNDER 2 MAIN HEADINGS' USE IN THE LIBRARY ITSELF AND
EXTERNAL USE, THE LENDING SYSTEM. OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES OF LIBRARY USE ARE'
LIBRARY REGULATIONS FORMING PART OF THE CIVIL LAW; THE LENDING SYSTEM, HOW TO
MAKE IT MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE USER AND USER EDUCATION COURSES WHICH SHOULD BE
ORGANISED BY LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE THE USERS' KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIBRARY S YSTEM.

MONITORING THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES-THE SURVEY AS A
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR CAPITAL SERVICES.
     
EXAMINES ISSUES IN THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF SEAT USE FOR STUDY PURPOSES
IN HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES' REPORTS BRIEFLY ON AN EXPERIMENTAL MONITORING
SYSTEM WHICH ADOPTS A ROTATING SAMPLE SURVEY DESIGN TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON
THIS IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF LIBRARY USER BEHAVIOUR, WHICH WITH A HIGH DEGREE
OF INITIAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FOUND CAPABLE OF BEING USEFULLY IMPLEMENTED
BY LIBRARY STAFF WITH LITTLE SURVEY TRAINING. THE SURVEY, UNDERTAKEN AT THE
FREWEN LIBRARY, PORTSMOUTH POLYTECHNIC (UK), PRODUCED A GOOD RESPONSE FROM
USERS, WAS SWIFT IN IMPLEMENTATION AND CAUSED LITTLE DISRUPTION OF LIBRARY
ACTIVITY.
RETRIEVAL ACHIEVEMENTS' EXPERIENCES AT THE MEDICAL LIBRARY SUBCENTRE OF
SZOLNOK COUNTY.
     
THE HOSPITAL MEDICAL LIBRARY AT SZOLNOK (HUNGARY) SUPPLIES LIBRARY SERVICES TO
248 DOCTORS, 30 PHARMACISTS, AND 21 PARAMEDICAL WORKERS. IN 1980 THERE WERE
325 CARD HOLDERS, THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY VISITS AMOUNTED TO 2,350, LOAN DATA TO
4,500 VOLUMES. DURING 1971-80 THE LIBRARY PERFORMED 426 LITERATURE SEARCHES
INCLUDING 7,680 BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES. FROM THE TOTAL OF 1,387 BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA IN 1979, 947 ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS WERE REQUESTED, 51 OF WHICH WERE NOT
AVAILABLE. INVESTIGATION OF THE CITATIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS BY THE
HOSPITAL'S STAFF REVEALED A 64% UTILISATION OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES IN
1979. REPEATED CONSULTATIONS DURING SEARCH PROCEDURE YIELDED IN ADDITION TO
RELEVANCE ALSO PERTINENCY OF DATA.
WALTER HOFMANN'S AND RUDOLF ANGERMANN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
METHODS OF READER RESEARCH. PART 2.
     
WALTER HOFMANN PUBLISHED AS PART 2 OF A PAPER ON LIBRARIES 2ON THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF THE PROLETARIAT (ZUR PSYCHOLOGIE DAS PROLETARIATS) 1IN 1910. HE CARRIED OUT
A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH INTO THE TYPES OF LITERATURE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE
READ, WHAT CATEGORIES WORKING CLASS READERS COULD BE DIVIDED INTO AND HOW TO
INFLUENCE AND IMPROVE THEIR READING HABITS. HE ALSO CARRIED OUT AN IMPORTANT
SURVEY ON WOMEN'S READING. RUDOLF ANGERMANN CONTINUED AND EXPANDED HOFMANN'S
WORK. THEY BOTH CONSIDERED THE STIMULI TO READ CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE TO
BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND ANGERMANN FORMULATED A LIST OF DIFFERENT READING
STIMULI. THEY WERE BOTH OF THE OPINION THAT THE LIBRARIAN'S TASK WAS TO ACT AS
ADVISER AND INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE LITERATURE AND THE READER. THEIR AIM WAS
TO OFFER GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE TO LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE. TODAY
METHODS OF READER RESEARCH CONTINUE TO BE D EVELOPED IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES
AND AIM TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION AND USE OF
LITERATURE.
INFORMATION SHEETS ON CHINESE READERS.
     
THE REPORT BRINGS TOGETHER THE INFORMATION SHEETS ISSUED BY THE RESEARCH TEAM
INVESTIGATING THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF CHINESE IN LONDON. THE PROJECT AIMS TO
ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNITY, FIND OUT ABOUT READING HABITS OF
ITS MEMBERS AND ASSESS HOW PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE MEETING THEIR NEEDS WITH A
VIEW TO IMPROVING THE SERVICES.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND LITERACY AMONGST CHILDREN AND ADULTS.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS DESPITE COMPULSORY EDUCATION FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION THERE
ARE NOW SOME 100,000 TO 400,000 (SEMI-)ILLITERATES. IN DUTCH SCHOOLS 2 METHODS
OF LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE HAVE BEEN USED, THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF
LEARNING TO RECOGNISE LISTS OF SIMPLE BUT UNRELATED WORDS AND THE FUNCTIONAL
METHOD WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE PUPIL'S ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHICHEVER
METHOD IS USED, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP THE PUPIL'S ABILITY TO READ
FLUENTLY AND TO MOTIVATE HIM TO CONTINUE READING AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL. THE
DUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT OF 1975 RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY SERVICES
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN ABOLISHING LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP CHARGES UP TO THE AGE OF 18.
HOWEVER, THE ACT FAILED TO RECOGNISE THE NEED TO PROVIDE SPECIAL TYPES OF
READING MATERIALS FOR PEOPLE WITH READING DIFFICULTIES.
INDEPENDENT LEARNING AND LIBRARIES.
     
DISCUSSES SELF-STUDY METHODS AND THEIR POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN CANADIAN
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF INDEPENDENT
LEARNING IS TRACED AND AN EXACT DEFINITION ADVANCED. FROM EXAMPLES OF EXISTING
PROGRAMMES IN EDUCATIONAL FIELDS AND BY EXAMINING THE SELF-STUDY PROCESS,
IDENTIFIES THE KIND OF ASSISTANCE THE LEARNER REQUIRES AND THE RESOURCES
AVAILABLE. THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN THIS CONTEXT IS THEN CONSIDERED IN
RELATION TO THE US ADULT INDEPENDENT LEARNING PROJECT, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL. IN CONCLUSION, ANALYSES THE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE, AND OUTLINES THE
TRAINING REQUIRED, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO CANADIAN COLLEGES.
DO NOT TEAR DOWN WHAT HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY BEEN BUILT UP.
     
REPORTS THE SPEECH BY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN, KARL JOHAN
MORTENSEN, TO THE MEETING OF THE KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES), WHERE THE QUESTION HAD EARLIER BEEN RAISED
OF HOW CULTURE COULD BE DISSEMINATED TO LARGER CIRCLES. IT WAS ARGUED THAT
EXPANSION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO REACH THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH
LIBRARIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK HAD PREVENTED GENUINE DECENTRALISATION
AND POPULARISATION OF CULTURE. LIBRARIES WITH RIGID MANAGEMENT AND DEMAND FOR
QUALIFIED STAFF WERE PREVENTING THEIR USE AS LOCAL CULTURE CENTRES. SOLUTIONS
INVOLVING GREATER COORDINATION WITH OTHER LOCAL ACTIVITIES WERE OFFERED.
AGAINST THIS MORTENSEN ARGUES THAT THE 1964 LIBRARY ACT PROMOTED
DECENTRALISATION AND THAT LIBRARIES MORE THAN OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE REACHING
THE BROAD POPULATION. WARNS AGAINST REDUCTION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN ORDER
TO HELP THE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS. LOCAL AUT HORITIES NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE
STATE FOR LIBRARY SERVICES. THE DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED AND THE REPLY FROM THE
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN STRESSED THAT LIBRARIES WERE NOT UNDER ATTACK.
LIBRARY USE AS A LEISURE ACTIVITY.
     
INTRODUCTORY SPEECH TO THE STUDY SESSION OF THE WORKING PARTY FOR COUNTY
LIBRARY SYSTEMS, NOORDWIJKERHOUT, 1 SEPT 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE RISE IN
LIVING STANDARDS SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INCREASE IN LEISURE
TIME. IN ADDITION THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DEVOTES A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS
INCREASED PURCHASING POWER TO ACQUIRING PRIVATE COMFORTS. WHEREAS BEFORE THE
WAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLED
BY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATE
CAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT AS
A SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWN
COLLECTION. AS THE ECONOMIC RECESSION DEEPENS THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WILL TURN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO RECREATIONAL CENTRES AND CREATE NEW
LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION CENTRES.
BIBLIOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE: FROM TEXTUAL CRITICISM TO BIBLIOMETRICS.
     
A REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE IN 1975 AND
1ST PUBLISHED IN 1979, DISCUSSING 20TH CENTURY DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE WORK OF
POLLARD ONWARDS. REFERENCE IS MADE TO MAJOR PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIELD BY
SCHOLARS SUCH AS COLE, ZOLTOWSKI, GASKELL AND LEVEBRE. THE SEARCH FOR
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IS DISTINGUISHED FROM TRUE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
RESEARCH, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHY THROUGH
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN BIBLIOMETRICS IS OUTLINED. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE
PROCEDURES OF MACROBIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS, AND OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MICROBIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF CITATION INDEXES. THE
NEXT ADVANCE ENVISAGED IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITATION CHAINS WHEN A
HUMANITIES CITATION INDEX BECOMES AVAILABLE, WHICH MAY WELL HAVE MAJOR
REPERCUSSIONS ON THE HISTORY OF IDEAS.

A USEFUL BASE FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF ESSEX
COUNTY, ONTARIO, 1825-52, WHICH CONTAINS THE EARLIEST WHITE SETTLEMENT IN WHAT
IS NOW ONTARIO AND WAS THE MOST WESTERLY OF THE 4 EARLY CORE AREAS IN THE

SOCIAL HISTORY AND ARCHIVAL PRACTICE.
     
THE ELABORATION, IN THE LAST 2 DECADES, OF A 'NEW SOCIAL HISTORY', CONCERNED
WITH SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND THE ATTITUDES, ACTIVITIES, AND DAILY LIVES OF
ORDINARY PEOPLE, WILL EVENTUALLY AFFECT ALL PHASES OF ARCHIVAL WORK. DEFINES
THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL HISTORY AND REVIEWS IN DETAIL THE WAYS IN WHICH IT
IMPINGES ON ARCHIVAL PRACTICE.
LIBRARIES, BOOKS, AND THE NATURE OF AMERICA: THE CREATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN
INSTITUTION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. IN 1836, US CONGRESS ACCEPTED A BEQUEST OF OVER HALF A
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE ESTATE OF JAMES SMITHSON, TO ESTABLISH IN WASHINGTON
AN INSTITUTION FOR 'THE INCREASE AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE AMONG MEN'. THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE FUND LAY WITH THE GOVERNMENT, SO THE
USE MADE OF IT HAD TO BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT RAISED THE PROBLEM
OF WHAT KINDS OF INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS AMERICA NEEDED,-AN ISSUE THAT INVOLVED
IMPLICIT NATIONAL SELF-DEFINITION. GIVES A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE DEBATE,
CULMINATING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
GUIDE TO REFERENCE SOURCES FOR THE SMALL LIBRARY.
     
AIMS TO PROVIDE A SELECT, CRITICALLY ASSESSED LIST OF REFERENCE SOURCES WHICH
A SMALL LIBRARY/INFORMATION UNIT COULD USE AS THE BASIS FOR BUILDING A
COLLECTION TAILORED TO ITS PARTICULAR NEEDS. THE GUIDE CONSISTS OF A BASIC
LIST OF REFERENCE BOOKS, A SUPPLEMENTARY LIST OF REFERENCE BOOKS AND SOURCES
OF FURTHER INFORMATION.
THE FACTS ABOUT CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE 1978/79 ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS OF THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP CARRIED OUT A SURVEY INTO CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS. 15 LIBRARIES, VARYING IN SIZE FROM SMALL TOWN TO LARGE CITY
LIBRARIES, WERE SELECTED, 5 IN AREAS WITH A STRONG PROTESTANT LEANING, 5 IN
ROMAN CATHOLIC AREAS AND 5 IN AREAS WITH NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. THE
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS STOCKED BY LIBRARIES WAS
IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE LIBRARY. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE
ASSURANCES OF ALL LIBRARIANS THAT NO FORM OF CENSORSHIP WAS PRACTISED, FEWER
BOOKS OF A POLITICALLY-CONTROVERSIAL OR PORNOGRAPHIC NATURE WERE TO BE FOUND
IN LIBRARIES IN RELIGIOUS AREAS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CENSORSHIP IS STILL ALIVE IN
THE NETHERLANDS IN 1981 UNDER THE GUISE OF 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL GROUNDS'.
THE LITERATURE OF POPULATION STUDIES' CITATION PATTERNS AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL.
     
(DLS THESIS-COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY). STUDY OBJECTIVES WERE (1) TO IDENTIFY
JOURNAL TITLES MOST FREQUENTLY CITED BY POPULATION SCIENTISTS PUBLISHING
ARTICLES IN 17 JOURNALS IN 1977 AND (2) TO DETERMINE THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF
VARIOUS INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO THEIR COVERAGE OF
POPULATION PERIODICAL LITERATURE. THE STUDY WAS ALSO DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY
DIFFERENCES IN THE CITATION PATTERNS OF VARIOUS POPULATION STUDY SUB-AREAS.
THE TEMPORAL SPAN OF POPULATION LITERATURE CITATION AND TYPES OF DOCUMENT
CITED WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED.
ARCHIVAL RESOURCES AND WRITING IMMIGRANT AMERICAN HISTORY' THE BUND ARCHIVES
OF THE JEWISH LABOR MOVEMENT.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. INCREASINGLY, US HISTORIANS ARE CARRYING OUT RESEARCH
INTO THE ACCULTURATION OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE USA. THE ARCHIVES OF THE JEWISH
LABOUR BUND, HELD IN NEW YORK CITY ARE ONE OF THE RAREST IMMIGRANT
COLLECTIONS, EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE, THEIR COMPREHENSIVENESS, AND
THEIR FOUNDERS' INTENTION TO PRESERVE THE PRESENT FOR THE FUTURE. THE
COLLECTION, INCLUDING PAMPHLETS, NEWSPAPERS AND POSTERS WAS ESTABLISHED IN
1899 IN GENEVA, TO SERVE AS THE ARCHIVE-LIBRARY OF THE THEN ILLEGAL SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC JEWISH LABOUR BUND OF RUSSIA, POLAND AND LITHUANIA. DESCRIBES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARCHIVES, THE COLLECTION ITSELF, AND ITS VALUE TO
HISTORIANS.
CITATION PATTERNS AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE' SOME
METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
     
RESEARCH EFFORTS FOR ARCHIVAL PRACTICE MUST AIM AT SHARPENING THE AWARENESS OF
THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND USE TO HELP ARCHIVISTS
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF DOCUMENTS IN THE HISTORICAL PROCESS. CITATION
STUDIES HAVE BEEN USED IN STUDYING PRACTICES AND PATTERNS IN CURRENT
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, BUT LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE REGARDING HISTORICAL
LITERATURE. DESCRIBES A PILOT STUDY IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE, BASED ON A
REFERENCE COUNT OF FOOTNOTES CITED IN 50 JOURNAL ARTICLES, PUBLISHED IN 1976
AND 77. ALTHOUGH RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY ONLY, FIGURES HAVE SOME INTEREST IN
SUGGESTING GENERAL PATTERNS AND AS AN INDICATION OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
WITH MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES INVOLVING A LARGER SAMPLE AND IN-DEPTH
ANALYSIS.
INTRODUCING APPLE II.
     
THE TEXT OF A BOOKLET WHICH PROVIDES ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION IN USING A
COMPUTER, DESIGNED FOR A QUEBEC CHILDREN'S LIBRARY PROJECT TO TEACH COMPUTER

HOW TO PROGRAMME IT. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WITH EXAMPLES FOLLOW, DEMONSTRATING
PROCEDURES FOR BASIC OPERATIONS AND THE RANGE OF THE COMPUTER'S FACILITIES.
CITATION HABITS OF HUNGARIAN GENERAL PRACTITIONERS.
     
THE JOURNAL OF THE HUNGARIAN ASSOCIATION OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS, THE
2MEDICUS UNIVERSALIS1 HAS BEEN REVIEWED WITH RESPECT TO THE NUMBER, TYPE, AND
LANGUAGE OF REFERENCES USED BY THE AUTHORS. THE PERIODICALS REFERRED TO HAVE
BEEN RANKED. FROM THE 77 ARTICLES IN 1979, 59 REPORTS CONTAINED 1,115
CITATIONS. 353 REFERRED TO REPORTS IN HUNGARIAN AND 762 TO PAPERS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGES. REFERENCES TO ARTICLES IN JOURNALS PREDOMINATED WITH 815 (73%)
CITATIONS, AND WAS FOLLOWED IN DECREASING ORDER BY BOOKS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS.
CITATIONS IN ORDER OF THE PUBLISHING COUNTRIES' HUNGARY (353), USA (237), UK
(194), WEST GERMANY (117), SWITZERLAND (76), FRANCE (57). STUDIES ON LANGUAGE
DISTRIBUTION SHOWED THE ORDER PREVAILING IN THE PAST DECADE, I.E. 475 ENGLISH
CITATIONS, 225 GERMAN, AND A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF CITATIONS IN OTHER
LANGUAGES.

SOCIAL GERONTOLOGY PERIODICALS.
     
THE LITERATURE OF GERONTOLOGY MAY BE FOUND IN THE JOURNALS OF MANY DISCIPLINES
AND IN THE POPULAR PRESS. ONLY JOURNALS PUBLISHED IN THE USA AND DEVOTED
EXCLUSIVELY OR IN LARGE PART TO THE LITERATURE OF SOCIAL GERONTOLOGY ARE
DESCRIBED HERE. JOURNALS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE LAYMAN RATHER THAN FOR THE
PROFESSIONAL WORKER ARE NOT INCLUDED, EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY CONTAIN SOME
MATERIAL OF INTEREST TO THE PROFESSIONAL. ALL AVAILABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION IS GIVEN, AND SPECIAL FEATURES OF EACH JOURNAL ARE DESCRIBED.
NEWSLETTERS OF MORE THAN LOCAL SIGNIFICANCE ARE LISTED BUT NOT INDIVIDUALLY
DESCRIBED.

LIBRARIES AND COLLECTIONS.
     
NOTES ON THOSE PARTS OF THE BRITISH FILM INSTITUTE LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL
FILM ARCHIVE (BOTH IN LONDON) COLLECTIONS RELEVANT TO THE STUDY OF US MEDIA.
THE INSTITUTE'S BOOK CATALOGUE RECORDS 1,000 ITEMS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE US
CINEMA; THE INSTITUTE ALSO HOLDS OVER 150 US PERIODICALS, OF WHICH OVER 60 ARE
CURRENTLY TAKEN. THE ARCHIVE HAS OVER 40,000 FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMES,
MANY FROM THE USA; IT ALSO HAS 850 US NON-FICTION FILMS AND MUCH OF ITS
ENORMOUS STILL, POSTERS AND DESIGNS COLLECTION IS CONNECTED WITH US MATERIAL.
IN SEARCH OF 'ETERNAL' PROBLEMS; YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE CLASSICS: THE CONDITIONS
FOR UNDERSTANDING.
     
LIBRARY FICTION ISSUES COMPRISE 2.5% OF TOTAL ISSUES, CLASSICS AMOUNTING TO 5%
OF THIS. IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING CLASSICAL FICTION IS UNDERVALUED. CHILDREN
READ CLASSICS AS PART OF THE SCHOOL SYLLABUS BUT BID FAREWELL TO THEM ON
LEAVING. CLASSICAL LITERATURE'S ROLE IN EDUCATION IS UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OF
FEELINGS THAT CHILDREN ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THEM OR ARE NOT INTERESTED.
CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT HOW EVERYTHING 'INTERCONNECTS' IN RUSSIAN
LITERATURE, WHICH ASKS THE SAME ETERNAL QUESTIONS AS 'MODERNS'. RUSSIAN
CLASSICS OUGHT TO BECOME INDISPENSABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES. SCHOOLS AND
LIBRARIES MUST FAMILIARISE CHILDREN WITH THE CLASSICS, COMBINING TOWARDS THEIR
INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT.
HARBORING TRADITION WITH COMPUTERS, BINDINGS, AND GENEALOGICAL COLLECTIONS.
     
THE MACON/BIBB COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY, GEORGIA, IS ONE OF THE USA'S MOST
AUTOMATED PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BUT ITS SERVICES ARE BASED UPON THE TRADITIONAL
CONCEPT THAT PATRONS COME TO A LIBRARY TO SEEK GOOD BOOKS AND RELIABLE ANSWERS
TO THEIR QUESTIONS. MACON OFFERS A 15,000 VOLUME OF GENEALOGICAL WORKS-THE
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL LIBRARY'S GENEALOGICAL AND HISTORICAL ROOM. IT WAS FOUNDED
IN 1923 BY THE MARY HAMMOND WASHINGTON CHAPTER DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION. MATERIALS INCLUDE BOOKS OF ABSTRACTED WILLS, DEEDS, MARRIAGES AND
MILITARY RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL 13 STATES. THE ROOM ATTRACTS LOCAL PATRONS
AND NON-RESIDENT RESEARCHERS.
LIBRARY PLANNING AND COOPERATION IN WEST GERMANY.
     
DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IN WEST
GERMANY, WHERE RESPONSIBILITY IS SHARED BETWEEN REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS.
OUTLINES THE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOCATES CONTROL TO REGIONAL OR
SUPRA-REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AS APPROPRIATE; SHOWS HOW NETWORK COOPERATION
FUNCTIONS; AND GIVES DETAILS OF PROJECTS IN HAND FOR IMPROVING DOCUMENT
DELIVERY, MODERNISING EQUIPMENT, AND FACILITATING ACCESS TO ARCHIVE MATERIAL.

ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA (AUSTRALIA) SOUTH-EASTERN BRANCH MEETING, MAR 81.
PRESENTS 3 BASIC STEPS FOR MORE EFFICIENT TIME MANAGEMENT IN LIBRARIES' (1)
AUDIT (A DIARY DETAILING HOW TIME IS SPENT FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS AND PREFERABLY
FOR A WEEK); (2) ANALYSIS (AS SERIES OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING TIME SPENT ON
EACH TASK, WHETHER TASKS CAN BE DELEGATED, WHETHER TASKS ARE GIVEN TOO MUCH
TIME OR NEGLECTED COMPLETELY-THIS SHOULD EXPOSE THE ENEMY, TIME WASTERS); AND
(3) ACTION (THE AIM BEING TO ELIMINATE TIME WASTERS, ORGANISE THE AVAILABLE
TIME EFFICIENTLY, AND DELEGATE TASKS WHERE POSSIBLE).
LIBRARY LONG-RANGE PLANNING' A SURVEY OF CURRENT PRACTICES.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF LIBRARY DIRECTORS IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI REVEALS
THAT APPROXIMATELY 37% CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN LONG-RANGE PLANNING. ANALYSIS OF
THESE PLANS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE MORE OPERATIONS-ORIENTED THAN
STRATEGY-ORIENTED. MOST ARE PREPARED ON AN INFORMAL BASIS BY THE DIRECTORS AND
THEIR STAFFS WITHOUT BENEFIT OF A FORMAL PLANNING METHODOLOGY. A MAJORITY OF
THE LIBRARY DIRECTORS NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN PLANNING EXPRESS A NEED TO DO
SO IN THE FUTURE.

PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AND COOPERATIVES' A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW.
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF US INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION DURING THE 20TH CENTURY.
UNSTRUCTURED COOPERATION, INDICATED BY SUCH ACTIVITIES AS THE NATIONAL UNION
CATALOG AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (1901) AND THE 1ST INTERLIBRARY LOAN CODE
(1917), CONTINUES TODAY. SINCE WORLD WAR II, STRUCTURED COOPERATION, INCLUDING
REGIONAL NETWORKS, SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, AND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVES, HAS
BECOME MORE PROMINENT. A DEFINITION OF LIBRARY COOPERATION IS OFFERED, AND
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TERMS SYSTEM, NETWORK, AND CONSORTIUM ARE EXPLORED.
PROBABLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY COOPERATION ARE MENTIONED, INCLUDING
APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND POTENTIAL POLITICAL BENEFITS OF
MULTITYPE LIBRARY COOPERATION.
NETWORKING: AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO CHANGE.
     
EDITED VERSION OF THE OPENING ADDRESS AT THE SEMINAR RESOURCE NETWORKING-A
RESPONSE TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, ORGANISED BY THE LIBRARY BRANCH, EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT OF VICTORIA (AUSTRALIA), OCT 80. DISCUSSES THE INTEREST IN RESOURCE
SHARING PROGRAMMES AND NETWORKS, TYPES OF COOPERATION IN THE EDUCATIONAL
ENVIRONMENT, THE MEANING OF THE TERM 'LIBRARY NETWORK', AND FEATURES OF A
WELL-DEVELOPED NETWORK.
THE ENGINEERING SOCIETIES LIBRARY AND THE NEW YORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOAN
PROGRAM' ONE SPECIAL LIBRARY'S EXPERIENCE IN A NETWORK.
     
DEALS WITH THE PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES OF THE ENGINEERING SOCIETIES LIBRARY
AS THEY PERTAIN TO ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE NEW YORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOAN
(NYSILL) PROGRAMME. A BRIEF GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE LIBRARY WILL BE
FOLLOWED BY A SHORT REVIEW OF THE NYSILL OPERATION AND THEN A STUDY OF THE
DAILY OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAMME AS THEY ARE HANDLED AT THE ENGINEERING
SOCIETIES LIBRARY.
ASPECTS OF CO-OPERATION, FUNDING PRODUCTION, COPYRIGHT, TALENT-SHARING UNION
LISTS, INTERLENDING.
     
ARGUES THE CASE FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER
INSTITUTIONS SPECIFICALLY SERVING THE PRINT-HANDICAPPED. A SYSTEM FOR
PRODUCING AUDIO CASSETTES IS PROPOSED AS AN EXAMPLE, PRESUMING ONLY THE
EXISTING RESOURCES AND FUNDING, WITHOUT RELYING ON GOVERNMENT GRANTS.
COOPERATIVE PROGRAM FOR COLLECTING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY AND
NON-DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.
     
NON-DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS
AVAILABLE WITHIN A REGION BY DEVELOPING COOPERATIVE STORAGE AND HANDLING
AGREEMENTS WITH AREA DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES. ALL CONDITIONS OF USE AND RETENTION
FOR DEPOSITORY MATERIALS APPLY, AND ACTUAL DOCUMENTS REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE DESIGNATED DEPOSITORY LIBRARY. THE DETAILS OF SUCH A COOPERATIVE
PROGRAMME BETWEEN RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND TROY PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE
DESCRIBED.
STANDARDS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND CODES' A UNION LIST APPROACH TO RESOURCE
SHARING IN THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA.
     
AS A RESULT OF MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY AND A GROWING CONSUMER PRESSURE
FOR PRODUCT RELIABILITY, MANUFACTURERS, ENGINEERS, GOVERNMENTAL
REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ALIKE ARE REQUIRING IMPROVED ACCESS TO
STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS. TRADITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION RESOURCE HAS
BEEN DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY, TO CONTROL, AND TO SERVICE. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS
PROBLEM, A SMALL TASK FORCE OF CHICAGO AREA TECHNICAL LIBRARIANS CONDUCTED A
SURVEY OF AREA USERS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT STANDARDS COLLECTIONS WERE AVAILABLE,
WHAT THE LEVEL OF NEED FOR STANDARDS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE, AND THE EXTENT TO
WHICH EXISTING COLLECTIONS MIGHT BE SHARED AMONG USERS.
TOWARDS LIBRARY UNIFICATION.
     
A TEXT PREPARED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES SECTION OF THE ASSOCIATION DES
BIBLIOTHECAIRES FRANCAIS (ABF) TO SUPPORT THE 1981 CONFERENCE MOTION ON
LIBRARY UNIFICATION. A PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION BRIEFLY INTRODUCES THE ISSUES
INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING AN INTEGRATED NATIONAL NETWORK, IN THE FACE OF A
GOVERNMENT POLICY OF DECENTRALISATION. THE ABF PROGRAMME FOR ACHIEVING
UNIFICATION IN SERVICE PROVISION, PERSONNEL ALLOCATION, AND PERSONNEL
TRAINING, IS THEN ELABORATED. IN EACH CASE DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE EXISTING
ORGANISATION OF RESOURCES, THE ADVANTAGES OF UNIFICATION OUTLINED, AND THE
MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING A POLICY OF INTEGRATION INDICATED.
PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSITY.
     
ARGUES THAT THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST SHOULD, IN MEDIATING BETWEEN PRODUCERS
AND CONSUMERS, EXERCISE DISCRIMINATION IN ASSESSING INFORMATION NEEDS AND
ADOPT A QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH. DISCUSSES THE
QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF INFORMATION PRODUCTION PUBLISHED OVER THE LAST 20
YEARS, AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINT BASED ON BAUDRILLARD'S
SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CONSUMPTION, EMPHASISING THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF
CONSUMER DEMANDS. IF THE SOCIOLOGICAL PRESSURES BEHIND USER NEEDS ARE
UNDERSTOOD, THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST IS THEN ABLE TO BOTH MONITOR USER
REQUIREMENTS AND EXERCISE SOME INFLUENCE OVER THE PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION
DESIGNED TO MEET SOCIAL PRESSURES RATHER THAN INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIVES.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A COMPULSORY PROVISION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
     
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY
CULTURAL SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED IN THE 1980S. THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS A
PART OF LOCAL CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR
EACH LIBRARY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATORS. A DECISION IS NEEDED AS TO WHETHER LOCAL
AUTHORITIES ARE NOT ONLY ENTITLED BUT ALSO OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY LAW SHOULD BE RENOUNCED IN FAVOUR
OF A CONCEPT WHEREBY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ON THEMSELVES THE OBLIGATION TO
PROVIDE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD DRAW UP THEIR OWN LIBRARY
PLANS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY; EACH STATE SHOULD THEN PROVIDE FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE FOR LIBRARY WORK OUTSIDE THESE AREAS.
THE LIBRARY BILL AND THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
     
THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ON THE MINISTRY OF
CULTURE'S LIBRARY BILL OF 24 SEPT 81. THE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSAL,
BUT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS. THUS IT SUPPORTS THE INCLUSION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN ONE ACT, BUT OPPOSES THE DECISION TO REMOVE SCHOOL
LIBRARIES. IT SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED AMALGAMATION OF THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE
AND THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIBRARY
COUNCIL, ALBEIT WITH A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION. IT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE ART
COLLECTIONS PUT ON A PAR WITH MUSIC COLLECTIONS, AND LIBRARY PROVISION FOR
INTERMEDIATE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES MADE OBLIGATORY. THE LIBRARY
CENTRE, OF WHOSE BOARD THE ASSOCIATION HAS A MAJORITY MEMBERSHIP, IS WILLING
TO COOPERATE IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY
AND URGES THAT ITS FINANCING BE CLARIFIED SOON. THE ASSOCIATION REGARDS THE
AMOUNT SET ASIDE FOR TRANSITION OF P ART-TIME LIBRARIES TO FULL-TIME STATUS
TOO LOW. IT SUPPORTS THE CHANGE TO BLOCK GRANT FINANCING.
STATUTES AND THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE PRINT HANDICAPPED.
     
CONTRASTS THE EDUCATION ACT, 1958 (VICTORIA), WHICH ATTEMPTS TO FINANCE
PROVISION FOR SERVICES FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR
NORMAL SCHOOLING WITH THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN ACT WHICH STRESSES THE SEPARATE
PROVISION FOR HANDICAPPED AND OTHER CHILDREN. METHODS OF INDIRECT REGULATION
IN THE FORM OF FUNDING WITH CONDITIONS ATTACHED ARE DISCUSSED AS IS THE CHOICE
AMONG FUNDING POSSIBILITIES. NOTES CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL SCHEME FOR LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED.

SERVICE OPERATIONS IS NOT ENOUGH BUT ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE USER PERFORMANCE IN
ORDER TO PROMOTE A BETTER UTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES.

AND RECORDING INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARIES. 1979 PRELIMINARY DRAFT.
     
COVERS THE BASIC MANAGEMENT INFORMATION NEEDS IN ACADEMIC, PUBLIC, SCHOOL AND
SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND OUTLINES THE TYPES OF INFORMATION USEFUL FOR
COMMUNICATING DATA ABOUT LIBRARY RESOURCES AND LIBRARY PROGRAMMES. A GLOSSARY
OF TERMS IS PROVIDED AS A GUIDE TO DATA ELEMENTS WHICH ARE USED FOR RECORDING,
REPORTING AND EXCHANGING DATA ABOUT LIBRARY RESOURCES AND LIBRARY PROGRAMMES.
LIBRARY RESOURCE ALLOCATION.
     
METHODOLOGICAL ATTEMPT TO ANALYSE AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPLICATED
PROBLEMS OF PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. THE FOCUS OF THE
STUDY IS ON RECENTLY ESTABLISHED LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES. SPECIFIC FINDINGS OF STUDIES CONDUCTED RECENTLY AT AN INDIAN
UNIVERSITY ARE ALSO PRESENTED.
THE TEC REPORT FOR THE 1982-84 TRIENNIUM.
     
DISCUSSES THE AUSTRALIAN TERTIARY EDUCATION COUNCIL'S REPORT 1982-84 AS IT
AFFECTS THE FINANCE AND SERVICES OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARY FUNDING DURING THIS PERIOD WILL DECLINE UNLESS
INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS PRESERVE THEIR LIBRARIES AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER
AREAS.
LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COST OF OPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
LIBRARIES. PART 1' TECHNIQUES AND CUMULATIVE STATISTICS.
     
THE LORCOST PROJECT WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DEVELOP A QUANTITATIVE PICTURE OF COSTS
AND SERVICES AT SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES IN THE USA BY THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL.
LEVELS OF OUTPUT RELATED TO COST OF OPERATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
LIBRARIES: PART 2. A CAPACITY MODEL OF THE AVERAGE COST FORMULA.
     
AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN MADE OF COST AND SERVICE DATA REPRESENTING 65
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES. THE DATA INCLUDE LIBRARIES IN A VARIETY OF
INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, RANGING IN OPERATING BUDGET FROM $20,000 TO
$2,000,000 PER YEAR. ALL THE DATA ARE WELL DESCRIBED BY A SINGLE FORMULA,
WHICH EXHIBITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE, AND FIXED RELATIVE UNIT COST OF THE VARIOUS
DIMENSIONS OF SERVICE. (FOR PART 1 SEE PREVIOUS ABSTRACT).
ECONOMIES THAT AFFECT THE HEART OF THE SERVICE' A 2BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1
DISCUSSION ON ASSISTED LIBRARY BUDGETS.
     
REPORT OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN FRIEDRICH ANDRAE, KLAUS HOHLFELD, ULRICH THIEM,
HANS JOACHIM VOGT AND 2BUCH UND BIBLIOTHEK1 HELD AT THE GERMAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN BREMEN, NOV 81. IT IS A LIBRARIAN'S JOB TO
PROMOTE THE USE OF BOOKS, A JOB WHICH MUST BE TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EVER
BEFORE. RECENT SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT ABOUT 40% OF THE POPULATION ARE LIBRARY
USERS. WHERE POSSIBLE, ECONOMIES SHOULD BE MADE IN WORKING METHODS RATHER THAN
IN SERVICES; THIS DEMANDS MORE CENTRALISATION. IT IS BETTER TO PUT BOOKS IN
LAUNDRY BASKETS ON WINDOW LEDGES AND ON PAVEMENTS THAN TO TAKE THEM AWAY FROM
THE PUBLIC COMPLETELY OR TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ONLY FOR RESTRICTED PERIODS.
LIBRARIES MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE MASTERY OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS,
AN ARGUMENT WHICH POLITICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE.
THE WILL TO SURVIVE.
     
DISCUSSES THE CUTBACKS IN SERVICES TO CHILDREN IN THE USA THROUGH PUBLIC AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND PROBLEMS OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES. TURNING POINTS IN PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN SEEM TO REVOLVE AROUND 3 FACTORS' USE OF THE
GENERALIST APPROACH IN PROVIDING SERVICE; THE CHANGING STATUS OF THE CENTRAL
CHILDREN'S LIBRARY; AND DEVELOPING SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST EXERT PRESSURE FOR EXAMINATION OF LIBRARY SCHOOL
CURRICULA AND RECOMMENDED PROGRAMMES THAT PREPARE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY
SPECIALISTS.
IT IS USELESS TO ECONOMISE WHEN MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.
     
THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS ADAPTING WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE RECESSION, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGETS. CULTURE IS IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC CRISES,
THEREFORE CULTURAL BODIES CANNOT RENEGE ON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
THRIFT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE MOST ECONOMIC PROCEDURE. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OF
STATISTICS ON LIBRARY EXPENDITURE BY LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WEST
GERMANY IN 1975-79 TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
STAFFING COSTS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET. A CAREFUL LIBRARY POLICY MUST RECOGNISE
THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF ADAPTING TO THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN
THE LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IF RATIONALISATION METHODS ARE
CARRIED OUT EFFICIENTLY, THE LIBRARY SERVICE CAN ADAPT IN THE RIGHT WAY.
ONLINE IN SAUDI ARABIA.
     
FACTORS INHIBITING THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN SAUDI LIBRARIES ARE OUTLINED. THE
RECENT TREND TOWARDS A GROWTH IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS, IN SPITE OF
DIFFICULTIES, IS NOTED IN THE LIGHT OF LABOUR SHORTAGES AND STAFFING PROBLEMS.
USE OF COMPUTERS IS SEEN AS ONE WAY TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICES WITHOUT
EXPANDING STAFF.
MICROCOMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ARCHIVES' A STUDY IN PROGRESS.
     
STATE OF THE ART REPORT ON THE USE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN ARCHIVAL WORK IN THE
USA AND CANADA. INCREASINGLY, THE COMPUTER IS USED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE TOOL
AND AS AN ASSISTANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION. THE 1ST STEPS HAVE BEEN
TAKEN IN ESTABLISHING AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING OF ARCHIVES, AND THERE ARE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA OF AUTOMATED ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, ALTHOUGH
THIS FIELD PRESENTS EVEN GREATER CHALLENGES AND DEFICIENCIES. DISCUSSES
MICROCOMPUTERS AS AN ARCHIVAL TOOL, AND CONCENTRATES PARTICULARLY ON THE MARS
PROJECT-MICROCOMPUTER ARCHIVES AND RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, AT THE ARCHIVES
OF APPALACHIA, EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY.
AUTOMATED NETWORKS FOR CANADIAN SCI-TECH LIBRARIES: STILL AN ANOMALY?.
     
LOOKS AT THE STATE OF NETWORKING ACTIVITIES OF THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LIBRARIES OPERATING IN THE ACADEMIC, PRIVATE, AND PUBLIC DOMAINS OF CANADA. A
RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THESE LIBRARIES TO BE VERY INVOLVED WITH AUTOMATION AND
ENGAGED IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOURS, BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO THE
LIBRARY'S ORGANISATION. HOWEVER, VERY FEW SCI-TECH LIBRARIES WERE FOUND TO BE
NETWORKING. SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE GIVEN AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR
THE FUTURE ARE EXPLORED.
ALS UPDATE.
     
UPDATE OF SOME DEVELOPMENTS OF ALS (2SEE1 80/2268). THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE
A BROWSER TERMINAL, THE LINE PROTECT UNIT, A BAR CODE READER AND AN IMPROVED
VERSION OF THE INTELLIGENT TERMINAL.
AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF OPERATIONAL MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SYSTEMS, AUTUMN, 1979.
     
TRADITIONALLY COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED, BOTH IN
SCALE AND TYPE, BY THE RELATIVELY HIGH PRICE OF CONVENTIONAL COMPUTER
EQUIPMENT. ADVANCES IN MICROELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY, AND ESPECIALLY
MICROPROCESSOR-BASED MACHINES, SUCH AS MICROCOMPUTERS AND WORD PROCESSORS,
HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR RADICALLY ALTERING THIS SITUATION. REPORTS ON A SURVEY
UNDERTAKEN BY ASLIB TO SEE HOW FAR THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS PENETRATED THE LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION WORLD. SYSTEMS IN THE VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS VISITED ARE
DESCRIBED, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE UTILISED.
AD HOC SUBCOMMITTEE ON STAFFING REPORT TO THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF
THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION FOR VIRGINIA.
     
BECAUSE THE STAFFING FORMULA MANDATED BY VIRGINIA'S STATE COUNCIL OF HIGHER
EDUCATION YIELDED UNREALISTICALLY LOW NUMBERS OF LIBRARY PERSONNEL FOR THE
LARGER INSTITUTIONS AND FOR MULTI-CAMPUS COMMUNITY COLLEGES, THE SUBCOMMITTEE
ON STAFFING OF THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING A
MORE SUITABLE FORMULA. GENERALLY, THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THE BASIC
FORMULA DEVELOPED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK COULD BE MODIFIED TO
SUIT THE PARTICULAR PERSONNEL NEEDS OF VIRGINIA'S ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND THAT
THE DEFINITIONS OF ALL FORMULA INPUT VARIABLES SHOULD BE REEXAMINED AND
CLARIFIED WHERE NECESSARY. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
OPTIMIZING LIBRARY STAFFING PROFILES WITHIN STATE GUIDELINES TO ACCOMMODATE
PEAK DEMANDS' RADFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY STAFFING REPORT.
     
DETERMINES THE PERIODS OF PEAK DEMANDS ON LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE RADFORD
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, ESTABLISHES STAFFING PROFILES TO MEET THESE DEMANDS, AND
PROJECTS CHANGES IN STAFFING LEVELS WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE MODIFY THE
LIBRARY'S SERVICE CAPABILITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
WE ARE BUILDING A MODEL PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
REPORTING ABOUT THE MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE OCCASION OF THE AWARD OF
PRIZES TO THE WINNERS OF THE 31ST ANNUAL NATIONAL COMPETITION FOR THE TITLE
MODEL PUBLIC LIBRARY, SOME THOUGHTS ARE GIVEN TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE SOCIALIST SOCIETY' READER SERVICES CONCERNING
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LITERATURE, SUBSCRIPTION TO PERIODICALS, ATTENTION TO THE
YOUNG GENERATION, HELP TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST
COMRADESHIP, ETC. FUTURE TRENDS AND REPORTS FROM VARIOUS LIBRARIES ARE GIVEN.
GIVE THE PART-TIME LIBRARIAN A CHANCE.
     
A TALK GIVEN TO THE ASSOCIATION OF PART-TIME LIBRARIANS, GROUP C OF THE DANISH
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, AT ITS 25 YEARS' JUBILEE, OCT 81, BY A FORMER CHAIRMAN.
WHEN THE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED IN 1956, AS AN ASSOCIATION OF PARISH
LIBRARIANS, THE POSITION AS PART-TIME LIBRARIAN WAS USUALLY HONORARY AND
UNPAID, A FACT WHICH CAUSED LACK OF ESTEEM FOR THE JOB. THERE WAS LITTLE
INTEREST IN MEMBERSHIP AND THE ASSOCIATION HAD TO BE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY
THE GROUP OF PARISH LIBRARY COMMITTEES, THE MEMBERS' EMPLOYERS. HOSTILITY HAS
BEEN MET FROM THE LIBRARIANS' ASSOCIATION AND LATER THE LIBRARIANS' UNION,
UNNECESSARILY, AS THE PART-TIME LIBRARIANS ON THE WHOLE RECOGNISE THE ULTIMATE
GOAL OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS, BUT INSIST ON
SATISFACTORY TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THERE SHOULD BE A CHANCE FOR PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES TO QUALIFY AS LIBRARIANS, AND IT IS
POSSIBLE FOR THE PROFESSIONALS AND THE NON-PROFESS IONALS TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE.
STAFF AND SALARIES IN AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN 1981.
     
UPDATE OF TABLES OF ESTABLISHMENTS AND SALARIES AT AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES 1ST PUBLISHED IN 2AUST. ACAD. RES. LIBR1. 3 (4) 1973. TABULATED
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON LIBRARY NAME, TITLE OF POST, SALARY/SALARY RANGE
AND COMMENTS/EQUIVALENCES RELATING TO (1) DEPUTY/ASSOCIATE LIBRARIANS; (2)
SENIOR LIBRARIANS; (3) LIBRARIANS; (4) LIBRARY ASSISTANTS/LIBRARY OFFICERS;
(OR THE EQUIVALENT IN EACH CASE). COMMENTS ARE ALSO MADE ON TRADE UNIONS AND
STAFF ASSOCIATIONS.
BUILDING AND REBUILDING, THE PROVISION AND EQUIPPING OF LIBRARIES FOR CHILDREN
AND YOUNG PEOPLE.
     
REPORT ON A FURTHER TRAINING SEMINAR HELD BY THE DEUTSCHES BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT
(GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON LIBRARIES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG
PEOPLE, OCT 81. TOPICS COVERED INCLUDED' PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LEISURE FACILITIES
WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES IN DENMARK AND PROBLEMS CAUSED
BY THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING AND THE QUESTION OF AN AGE LIMIT
BETWEEN ADULT AND CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES; THE ARCHITECTURE OF CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES AT HOME AND ABROAD; COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIANS, ARCHITECTS AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE PLANNING OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF
CONSIDERING THE CHILDREN'S OWN WISHES; HARMONY BETWEEN AESTHETIC AND
FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DESIGN; AND CHILDREN'S LIBRARY FURNITURE.
SHOULD LIBRARIES BE UNIONISED?.
     
REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT A 1982 MEETING OF QUEBEC PUBLIC LIBRARIANS. THE
SPEECHES FOR AND AGAINST THE MOTION ARE SUMMARISED' THE MAIN TOPICS RAISED
WERE THE IMPORTANCE OF UNION SUPPORT IN NEGOTIATING SALARIES AND CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT; WAYS OF ORGANISING UNIONS TO SERVE DIVERSE INTERESTS; AND
CONSTRAINTS ON ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY. POINTS RAISED IN THE ENSUING DEBATE
ARE SELECTIVELY REPORTED.
A SHORT HISTORY OF UNIONISATION IN QUEBEC LIBRARIES.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1982 MEETING OF QUEBEC PUBLIC LIBRARIANS, SURVEYING THE
PRESENT SITUATION AS IT HAS DEVELOPED FROM THE BEGINNING OF INTEREST IN
UNIONISATION IN THE 1970S. THE MAIN POINTS COVERED ARE LIBRARIANS' ATTITUDES
TO UNIONS, AFFILIATIONS WITH OTHER UNIONS, UNION MEMBERSHIP AND ITS
PROGRESSIVE INCREASE, AND THE FACTORS INFLUENCING RECRUITMENTS.
PROFESSIONAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR MEDIA/LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS' DISTRICT AND SCHOOL.
     
AIMS TO PROMOTE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS AS
IT RELATES TO LIBRARIANS AND THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS THEY SERVE. ISSUES
COVERED INCLUDE AN OVERVIEW OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, STRATEGIES AND
PREPARATION FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, NEGOTIATING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENT AND THE IMPACT OF THE MEDIA LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL ON MEDIA PROGRAMMES
THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS.
FIJI'S SECONDARY SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS' A PROFILE.
     
DESCRIBES SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN FIJI, CONCENTRATING ON'
TRAINING; STAFFING OF LIBRARIES; LENGTH OF TIME THAT LIBRARIANS HAVE HELD
THEIR POSITIONS; AND THE MAJOR SUBJECT AREAS OF TEACHER-LIBRARIANS. ELABORATES
AND EXPANDS FINDINGS OF A SURVEY BY JOHN RAGNI PUBLISHED IN THE 2FIJI LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION JOURNAL1, DEC 79.
THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY TECHNICIAN.
     
A DISCUSSION OF THE PRESENT SITUATION IN QUEBEC BY A DOCUMENTATION TECHNOLOGY
WORKER. THE AVAILABLE TRAINING COURSES ARE OUTLINED, AND THE DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN TECHNICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCE
TO TRAINING, RESPONSIBILITIES AND STATUS, DEFINED. THE TECHNICIAN'S MAIN
PROBLEMS, LACK OF RECOGNITION BY EMPLOYERS AND OPPOSITION FROM OTHER
CATEGORIES OF STAFF, ARE CONSIDERED, AND IN CONCLUSION, PREDICTS THAT THE
PRESENT DRAWBACKS WILL DIMINISH AS THE USE OF LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY INCREASES.
THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNICATION.
     
THE INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF ALL ELEMENTS DETECTABLE BY THE SENSES IS IMPORTANT
TO THE DESIGN OF SPACES FOR USE BY THE HANDICAPPED. OFFERS EXAMPLES EMBODYING
THIS PRINCIPLE. QUESTIONS THE ASSUMPTION OF DIFFICULTY IN DESIGNING FOR THE
DISABLED PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE DEMANDS MADE BY THE PLACE IN SOCIETY OF
MOTOR VEHICLES. MENTIONS ALSO THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF BUILDINGS WHICH MAY BE
INVITING OR DISCOURAGING.
STANDARDS FOR LIBRARY BUILDING.
     
THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDS IN THE PLANNING AND RUNNING OF ALL TYPES OF
LIBRARY ARE STRESSED. THE EFFECT OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS
COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING, CIRCULATION CONTROL AND COOPERATIVE ACQUISITION
COUPLED WITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ON LIBRARY STANDARDS ARE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH
THE NEED TO DESIGN FOR HANDICAPPED LIBRARY USERS.
LIBRARY BUILDING IN AUSTRIA.
     
AFTER A HISTORICAL OUTLINE ON LIBRARIES IN AUSTRIA, STARTING WITH THE MEDIEVAL
LIBRARIES OF THE MONASTERIES, EMPHASIS IS LAID ON THE BUILDINGS AND PLANNING
SINCE WORLD WAR II. IT IS SHOWN THAT IN RECENT YEARS 15,000 SQ.M. WERE MADE
AVAILABLE WHILE MORE THAN 30,000 SQ.M. ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND 45,000 SQ.M.
ARE IN THE PLANNING STAGE.
THE ARCHITECT'S VIEW OF MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS.
     
USING LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS FOR OTHER PURPOSES OUTSIDE OPENING HOURS IS A
NATURAL AND GOOD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DEVELOPING LIAISON WITH OTHER CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES. THE TRADITION OF CHARGING AT MOST A NOMINAL RENT IS LESS
DEFENSIBLE. EXTRA USE INVOLVES UPKEEP AND STAFFING COSTS, AND ORGANISATIONS
MAY RENT UNSUITABLE PREMISES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. THE DISTRICT CENTRE AT
LYNGEN, NORWAY, HOUSING A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISATIONS AND A POTENTIAL EXAMPLE
OF INTEGRATED ACTIVITY, HAS TO CHARGE A RENT UNACCEPTABLE TO SMALLER GROUPS.
FOR EFFECTIVE USE, ALL CULTURAL PREMISES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FINANCIAL
STANDING AND JOINT ADMINISTRATION. IN PLANNING OR CONVERSION, THE NEEDS OF
INDIVIDUAL USERS SHOULD BE ANALYSED AND COORDINATED. THE LIBRARIAN, FOR
INSTANCE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENT CERTAIN AREAS FULL-TIME (E.G. THE NECESSARY
SPACE FOR STORING EQUIPMENT, SHELVING AND BOOKS) AND OTHER AREAS FOR THE
LIBRARY'S ACTUAL OPENING HOURS, OUTSIDE WHICH THEY COULD BE USED  BY OTHER
ORGANISATIONS.
ALESUND LIBRARY ON THE TOWN'S MOST CENTRAL SITE.
     
ALESUND CENTRAL LIBRARY, NORWAY, OPENED IN SEPT 80 AS PART OF A MAJOR
ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE PROJECT HAD UNDERGONE LONG AND CONTROVERSIAL
DISCUSSION AND THE LIBRARIAN WAS NOT INVOLVED AT THE PLANNING STAGE, AN
UNSATISFACTORY SITUATION. THE LIBRARY (WITH MORE AND ROMSDAL COUNTY LIBRARY)
NOW OCCUPIES CENTRALLY PLACED PREMISES OF 2400 SQ.M. THOUGH ITS LONG, NARROW
SHAPE IS AWKWARD AND RATHER CRAMPED. A WALKWAY WITH STAIRS, RAMPS AND A LIFT
FROM GROUND LEVEL HELPS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LIBRARY'S SITUATION ON THE 1ST
FLOOR. THE PUBLIC ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WARM, ATTRACTIVE INTERIOR. AN
INTERNAL LIFT GIVES ACCESS TO BASEMENT STACKS; THE MAIN DEPARTMENTS ARE ALL ON
THE 1ST FLOOR, BUT THE 2ND FLOOR HOUSES OFFICES AND A COMPLEX OF PUBLIC ROOMS
FOR MEETINGS, STUDY GROUPS AND STORY HOURS.
A NEW EPOCH (NETHERLANDS LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND).
     
DESCRIPTIVE BROCHURE GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE NETHERLANDS LIBRARY FOR THE
BLIND'S NEW BUILDING IN THE HAGUE, OPENED IN SUMMER 80.
DESIGNING A MEDIUM-SIZED PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
AIMS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ARCHITECT AND LIBRARIAN AND TO ASSIST
EACH TO UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF THE OTHER IN ORDER THAT THEY
MAY PROVIDE BETTER LIBRARIES FOR USERS.
SIMULATING PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THE HANDICAPPED LIBRARY USER.
     
PARTICIPANTS SIMULATING CONDITIONS OF PHYSICAL HANDICAP ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE
AND USE VARIOUS ITEMS OF LIBRARY EQUIPMENT. DIFFICULTIES OF ACCESS AND
INADEQUATE SIGNPOSTING AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOUND AS WELL AS THE LACK OF A
FIRE WARNING PERCEPTIBLE TO THE DEAF AND INADEQUATE LIGHTING FOR THE PARTIALLY
SIGHTED.
A TALE OF TIFFANY WINDOWS.
     
DESCRIBES HOW, IN THE 1920S, SEVERAL SECULAR STAINED GLASS WINDOWS PLACED IN
THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLASSROOM BUILDING OF BLOOMSBURG STATE COLLEGE,
PENNSYLVANIA, IMPROVED STUDENT ATTITUDES AND MODERATED NOISE LEVELS. OUTLINES
THE BACKGROUND TO THE PURCHASE OF THESE WINDOWS, THREE OF WHICH WERE DESIGNED
BY LOUIS C. TIFFANY. THESE WINDOWS ARE NOW INCORPORATED INTO THE DESIGN OF THE
NEW COLLEGE LIBRARY, WHERE, IT IS THOUGHT, THEY MAINTAIN A PLEASANT AESTHETIC
ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING.
MAXIMISING THE MILLIMETER.
     
DISCUSSES HOW THE MEDIUM OF PHOTOGRAPHY CAN SERVE MANY LIBRARY FUNCTIONS,
INCLUDING' REVITALISING SIGNS; ADDING AN IMPORTANT DIMENSION TO LOCAL HISTORY
COLLECTIONS; SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SERIES; PUBLICITY; AND TRAVELLING
PHOTOGRAPHIC EXHIBITIONS.
PLAN FOR A SIGN SYSTEM AT THE IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
     
EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A SYSTEM OF
SIGNS TO MAKE THE LIBRARY PATRON AWARE THAT A RELIABLE PATTERN OF INFORMATION
EXISTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY. INCLUDES A SELECTION OF STATEMENTS EXCERPTED FROM
2SIGN SYSTEMS FOR LIBRARIES1, A COLLECTION OF PAPERS ON VISUAL GUIDANCE
SYSTEMS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARIES EDITED BY DOROTHY POLLETT AND PETER C.
HASKELL, AND AN OUTLINE, EXPLANATION, AND LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A
PROPOSED SIGN SYSTEM FOR THE IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. NEW POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION WITHIN
UNIVERSITIES.
     
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO
MAKE ACADEMIC UNIVERSITY WORK CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE TO THE OUTSIDER. 1 WAY IS
THROUGH WELL-ORGANISED PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. AN
EXHIBITION WHICH WAS ORGANISED BY STUDENTS OF THE HISTORY OF ART DEPARTMENT AT
FREIBERG UNIVERSITY IN JUNE/JULY 80 WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF
ACTIVITY. THE STUDENTS ARRANGED CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA, THE ACTUAL EXHIBITION
OBJECTS, CONTACT WITH THE ARTISTS, PUBLICITY, AN OPENING AT WHICH THE ARTISTS
WERE PRESENT, GUIDES TO THE EXHIBITION, WORKSHOPS, TALKS AND PUBLIC
DISCUSSIONS. ALL THE LIBRARY HAD TO DO WAS PROVIDE THE EXHIBITION ROOMS. THE
EXHIBITION WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND ACTED AS A STIMULUS TO OTHER GROUPS
WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY TO ORGANISE SIMILAR EXHIBITIONS TO PRESENT THEIR CURRENT
WORK PROJECTS TO THE PUBLIC.
STUDIES OF THE ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION' A COMMENTARY.
     
REPORT INTENDED AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSION OF PAST RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF
ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION AND FOR CONSIDERATION OF POSSIBLE FUTURE STUDIES.
RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT BY HEURISTIC INFORMATION.
     
AFTER A REVIEW OF HEURISTICS AND HEURISTIC INFORMATION SOME ASPECTS OF MISSION
ORIENTED INFORMATION ARE DEALT WITH FROM THE LIBRARIAN'S VIEWPOINT.
INFORMATION STAFF SHOULD BE AWARE THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION MAY BE LOCATED BY
SEARCHING FIELDS OTHER THAN THE USER'S SPECIALITY. IN ADDITION TO THE
TRADITIONAL SOURCES, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH ASSISTS IN THE EXPLOITATION
OF SUCH MATERIALS AS REPORTS IN METHODOLOGICAL SURVEYS, RESEARCH REPORTS AND
DISSERTATIONS. SOCIOLOGICAL INFORMATION CAN BE OF HEURISTIC VALUE IN
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, HEURISTIC INFORMATION WILL BE SERVICEABLE
ONLY IF THE LIBRARIAN IS FAMILIAR WITH THE SCIENTIST'S AIMS AND FIELD OF
RESEARCH.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT-THE SOCIAL RELEVANCE OF
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
EXTRACT FROM THE 6TH GABRIEL A. BERNADO MEMORIAL LECTURE, UNIVERSITY OF THE
PHILIPPINES, MAR 79. CONSIDERS THE ROLE PLAYED BY INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF ALL
TYPES IN REACHING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES. DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS IN BUILDING THE INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFORMATION POLICY-MAKING IN A CONSTANTLY CHANGING SOCIETY,
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. THE USE OF
INFORMATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT IS TREATED IN DETAIL AS AN EXAMPLE.
DOCUMENTATION ON THE IVORY COAST.
     
SUMMARY OF RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 1981 BY THE IVORY COAST NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY. PRELIMINARY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
SITUATION OF THE IVORY COAST, THE MOST DEVELOPED OF THE FORMER AFRICAN
COLONIES. A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION SERVICES WAS EFFECTED TO
ESTABLISH WHETHER INFORMATION PROVISION PRODUCED DEVELOPMENT, OR RESULTED FROM
IT. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
NETWORK LINKS, EXPENDITURE, AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION POLICY. FORMAL AND
INFORMAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ARE ANALYSED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES, WHERE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE
COLLECTIONS IS NOT FULLY EXPLOITED BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE RESOURCES, AS
COMPARED TO THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY INFORMATION CENTRE, WHICH IS FINANCIALLY
WELL SUPPORTED. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY INCLUDE COOPERATION WITH
OTHER AFRICAN STATES, THE ELABORATION OF A COHERENT NATIONAL INFORMATION
POLICY, THE IMP OSITION OF CHARGES FOR INFORMATION SERVICES, AND THE
DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN INFORMATION USE. THE EVIDENCE, IT IS
CONCLUDED, SHOWS THAT DOCUMENTATION IS A PRODUCT OF DEVELOPMENT.
THE OBJECTIVES AND PROBLEMS OF A DOCUMENTATION SERVICE IN A LARGE BUSINESS
CONCERN.
     
PRESENTATION OF THE GENERAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF A PRIVATE
INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION SERVICE. DISCUSSES THE ESSENTIAL ORIENTATION OF THE
SERVICE TO ESTABLISHING DEFINITE OBJECTIVES, MAINTAINING CLOSE RELATIONS WITH
USERS, EXERCISING DISCRETION, AND BUDGETING WISELY; DOCUMENTATION AND
INFORMATION TASKS IN RELATION TO HOW TO ACQUIRE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION, THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE KINDS OF INFORMATION DEMANDED, AND MANAGEMENT OF
EXTERNAL RELATIONS; AND THE KIND OF PERSONNEL REQUIRED AND HOW TO SELECT THEM.
IS BELGIUM HEADING FOR INFORMATIONAL UNDERDEVELOPMENT?.
     
PREDICTS IMMINENT INDUSTRIAL COLLAPSE UNLESS THE COUNTRY REALISES THE
IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION AND MAKES IT AVAILABLE. IN GENERAL, BELGIUM HAS
FAILED TO KEEP PACE WITH DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY,
AND LACKS EQUIPMENT, TRAINED PERSONNEL, NETWORK ORGANISATION, AND EVEN
ADEQUATE COLLECTION CATALOGUES. THE WORLD'S INFORMATION RICHES CAN BE ACCESSED
THROUGH COMPUTER TERMINALS, TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS, AND DATA BASES.
GERMANY'S ACHIEVEMENT IS CITED FOR COMPARISON. A BRIEF SKETCH IS GIVEN OF THE
INUMERABLE POTENTIAL FIELDS IN NEED OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION SERVICES, AND THE
BENEFITS WHICH WOULD ENSUE FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE.
ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT UTILIZING ONLINE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES AND ON-LINE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS.
     
WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN A STUDY BY THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND ON THE USE OF CABLE
TELEVISION (CATV) TO SERVE PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND GOVERNMENT NEEDS IS
REPORTED. THE STUDY IS PART OF AN OVERALL PROJECT TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE
DELIVERY OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND TO
EXPLORE THE ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES AIMED AT IMPROVING COMMUNICATIONS AMONG
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL INNOVATION NETWORK (NIN) AND BETWEEN NIN AND MEMBERS
OF THE FEDERAL LABORATORY CONSORTIUM. DISCUSSES DEVELOPMENT OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION SERVICES, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION, AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE
USE OF CATV IN RHODE ISLAND.
THE PATENT LIBRARY IN THE INSTITUTE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION OF CHINA.
     
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PATENT LIBRARY IN THE INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION OF CHINA (ISTIC). WITHIN THIS LIBRARY RESIDES CHINA'S

THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCENE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB CONFERENCE, CURRENT AFFAIRS' INFORMATION AND
RESOURCES, LONDON, 4 JUNE 81. LOOKS AT THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
IN RELATION TO THE POLICY OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS AND DISCUSSES THE MORE IMPORTANT
SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, BOTH INTERNALLY AND
EXTERNALLY PRODUCED. PINPOINTS THE MAIN PLAYERS ON THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL
SCENE, INDICATING THEIR POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON BUSINESS. PROBLEMS OF USING
POLITICAL INFORMATION INCLUDE' THE SUPER-ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION, AND
ESPECIALLY OPINION ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS; THE TENDENCY FOR INFORMATION PROVIDERS
TO INTERPRET POLITICAL FACTS; AND LACK OF APPRECIATION BY SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF
THE VALUE OF SYSTEMATIC POLITICAL MONITORING AND ANALYSIS.
A PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION TO SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB CONFERENCE CURRENT AFFAIRS' INFORMATION AND
RESOURCES, LONDON, 4 JUNE 81. EXPLAINS WHAT THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE
ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, BOTH IN PUBLICATIONS AND COMPUTERISED
DOCUMENTATION SYSTEMS, AND HOW THIS INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED IN THE UK AND
WHERE YOU CAN FIND IT. DESCRIBES THE COMMUNITY'S 5 INSTITUTIONS, THE ECONOMIC
AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE, THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK AND COMMISSION PROPOSALS.
DISCUSSES' CRONOS-EUROSTAT, THE COMMUNITY'S STATISTICAL DATA BANK; CELEX
(COMMUNITATIS EUROPAEAE LEX), THE INTER-INSTITUTIONAL COMPUTERISED

EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON INFORMATION ON FOREIGN LAW.
     
PROVIDES A TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON INFORMATION ON
FOREIGN LAW, WHICH CAME INTO BEING AS A RESULT OF FORMAL RECOGNITION BY THE
COUNCIL OF EUROPE THAT INCREASING MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND GOODS ACROSS
EUROPEAN FRONTIERS HAS RESULTED IN AN INTERPENETRATION OF LAWS AND THE
ATTENDANT NEED TO TAKE FOREIGN LAW INTO CONSIDERATION. DISCUSSES THE PROCEDURE
AND PRECEDENT FOR ACCESSION OF A STATE NOT A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE.
DESCRIBES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION IN AUSTRIA, DENMARK, GREECE,
THE NETHERLANDS AND WEST GERMANY.
CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY AND GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION, PROSPECTS AND EVENTS.

INFORMATION OFFICE.
THE GOOD INFORMATION GUIDE.
     
DESCRIBES THE MANCHESTER FAMILY WELFARE ASSOCIATION APPROACH TO THE
ORGANISATION AND EXPLOITATION OF ITS INFORMATION RESOURCES RELATING TO
HANDICAP. THE INFORMATION SERVICE IS RUN BY A SOCIAL WORKER WHO DEALS WITH
REQUESTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND IS OFTEN ABLE TO PROBE MORE DEEPLY INTO NEEDS
EXPRESSED IN AN APPARENTLY SIMPLE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION
FILES ARE HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL AND GROWING SUBSTANTIALLY WITH INPUT FROM FWA
AND LOCAL AUTHORITY SOCIAL WORKERS.
PLMRU. REPORT OF A DISSEMINATION WORKSHOP TO REVIEW PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENTS
IN COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
THE WORKSHOP, HELD AT HARROGATE 14-15 MAR 80, AIMED TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR LIBRARIANS WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICY MAKING AND FOR MANAGING SERVICES
TO DISCUSS PROGRESS SINCE THE LAST WORKSHOP HELD IN 1979 AND TO DISCUSS FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS.
INFORMATION USES IN SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS.
     
A PAPER DELIVERED AT THE 1979 IRFIS CONFERENCE IN OSLO, REPORTING A
USER-EVALUATION STUDY OF A CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETIN PRODUCED FOR SOCIAL
SERVICES STAFF, CARRIED OUT IN THE COURSE OF A MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO
INFORMATION NEEDS IN UK SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF DATA
COLLECTION PROCEDURE, AND RESULTS PRESENTED IN FULL, WITH TABLES. FROM DATA
OBTAINED ON TYPES OF INFORMATION CONSIDERED RELEVANT; CASE STUDY MATERIAL ON
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS USING A CRITICAL INCIDENT APPROACH; AND INFORMATION ON USE
OF THE BULLETIN AND COPIES OF JOURNAL ARTICLES, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE
SCALE AND GENERALITY OF THE SOCIAL WELFARE FIELD ARE SO GREAT THAT AN SDI

GIVEN OF THE CENTRE'S ORGANISATION, SERVICES, AND PUBLISHED INDEXES.
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE STEI (SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMIC INFORMATION) SYSTEMS WITHIN THE REGION. CAN IT BE PUT INTO PRACTICE?.
     
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE STEI SYSTEMS WITHIN A REGION IS A LONG
STANDING PROBLEM, THE AIM OF WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PARAMOUNT RIGHT OF THE
READER TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL AVAILABLE LITERATURE SOURCES. ALTHOUGH THE
MINISTRY OF CULTURE TOGETHER WITH THE CZECHOSLOVAK STATE LIBRARY PUBLISHED IN
1974 'PRINCIPLES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM IN THE
CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC', IT REMAINED ONLY METHODOLOGICAL ADVICE.
THERE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH COOPERATION. THE SPHERES IN WHICH THIS SHOULD BE
STARTED ARE CONSIDERED.

IN THE 1980S. NOTES THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH INTO HOW THE NEEDS OF MANAGERS
IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR COULD BE MET.
GAS LIBRARIES' AN INDUSTRY-WIDE NETWORK.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICES COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN GAS ASSOCIATION IS THE VEHICLE
THROUGH WHICH THE GAS INDUSTRY LIBRARY NETWORK OPERATES. THE NETWORK WAS
FORMED IN 1972 AND HAS GROWN TO BE AN ACTIVE COMMITTEE OF 32 MEMBERS FROM THE
USA AND CANADA. DURING THESE YEARS, IT HAS DEVELOPED BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION, STRENGTHENED THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NATURAL
GAS-RELATED TOPICS, AND IMPROVED THE COMPETENCE OF ITS MEMBER LIBRARIANS.

AND UK NATURAL SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS. COMPARES THE
NATURE OF THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS EXPERIENCED AND INVESTIGATES THE ROLES OF
TRANSLATIONS AND REVIEW ARTICLES IN OVERCOMING THESE BARRIERS. CONCLUDES THAT
IN SUBJECTS WHERE IMPORTANT NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE PRIMARY LITERATURE EXISTS,
GREATER RESOURCES SHOULD BE INVESTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION, TRANSLATION, AND
PUBLICATION IN ENGLISH OF GOOD-QUALITY NON-ENGLISH REVIEW ARTICLES WHICH GIVE
EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NON-ENGLISH PRIMARY LITERATURE.
COMMUNICATION AND INTEGRATION WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE, WATER, WASTE AND ENERGY
INDUSTRIES.
     
INVESTIGATION INTO HOW LARGE INSTITUTIONS AND GROUPS OF PEOPLE GET THEIR
INFORMATION AND WHETHER THEY GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION. IN PARTICULAR, IT
STUDIES HOW THE DECISIONS OF 1 INSTITUTION MAY UNWITTINGLY AFFECT ANOTHER
INSTITUTION. THE SPECIAL AREA OF INTEREST LIES IN THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF
INTEGRATING AND COORDINATING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE AGRICULTURE, WATER, WASTE
AND ENERGY (AWWE) SECTORS IN THE UK, WHERE LARGE CASH AND ENERGY SAVINGS SEEM
POSSIBLE. THE COMMENTS, HOWEVER, HAVE GENERAL APPLICATIONS.
APPLYING H.A. SIMON'S MODEL OF LIMITED RATIONALITY TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND
COMMUNICATION.
     
A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUT
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CONCERNING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, RESULTS, ORGANISATION,
POLICIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED
FOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS
(1979) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OF
LIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONAL
OPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONS
FREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMAL
INFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMAL
GROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TO
FUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE
USED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THE
CONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS. THE QUALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION
SOURCES IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, HENCE THE IMPORTANCE
OF UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR.

NOV 80. DESCRIBES A MODEL LINGUISTIC DATA BANK (LDB) FOR A UK MARKET, BASED ON
RESULTS FROM A CONTINUING FEASIBILITY STUDY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER
INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. A LDB REPRESENTS AN ECONOMICAL AND HIGHLY
EFFICIENT WAY OF ORGANISING THE UK'S EFFORTS IN THE FIELD OF TERMINOLOGY, BOTH
WITH RESPECT TO ENGLISH AND THE MANY FOREIGN LANGUAGES THROUGH WHICH CONTACT
IS MAINTAINED WITH NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES. OUTLINES THE INSTITUTIONAL
AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND EMPHASISES THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO
VARIOUS GROUPS, AND IN PARTICULAR TO TRANSLATORS, AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE THESE
GROUPS WILL PLAY IN ASSURING THE CONTINUING VIABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF THE
LDB, NOT ONLY AS USERS, BUT AS CONTRIBUTORS AND ADVISORS. CONSIDERS DATA

AND DISCUSSES THE RESULTS WITH EMPHASIS ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE, SUBSTRUCTURE, AND BIOLOGICAL DATA SEGMENTS OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM.
THE DRUG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM OF NCI'S
DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM.
     
THE US NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE'S DRUG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHEMICAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED TO MONITOR THE ACCESSION, STORAGE, AND
DISTRIBUTION OF CHEMICALS AND DRUGS FOR ANTI-TUMOUR TESTING. IT IDENTIFIES
DUPLICATES AND ANALOGUES OF INTEREST TO THE INSTITUTE'S DEVELOPMENTAL
THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM; PRODUCES ACTION AND INFORMATION DOCUMENTS AS REQUIRED;
MAINTAINS INVENTORY CONTROL; AND INTERFACES WITH THE BIOLOGY DATA PROCESSING
SYSTEM WHICH EVALUATES AND DISSEMINATES SCREENING RESULTS. AN ON-LINE
INTERACTIVE RETRIEVAL SUBSYSTEM PERMITS SUBSTRUCTURE AND FULL STRUCTURE
SEARCHING ON A FILE OF 310,000 COMPOUNDS. RESULTS OF SEARCHING OTHER DATA
BASES ARE LINKED WITH THE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS WORTHY OF ACQUISITION.
AN INDEX OF NON-SYSTEMATIC NAMES IN 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1, REFERENCED TO
COMPOUNDS IN THE SYSTEM, IS GENERATED.

A CONFLATION ALGORITHM IDENTIFIES WORD VARIANTS AND REDUCES THEM TO A SINGLE
CANONICAL FORM. DISCUSSES ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF SOME TYPES
WHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS WITH A RANGE OF KEYWORD DICTIONARIES AND WITH THE
CRANFIELD DOCUMENTATION TEST COLLECTION SUGGEST THAT THERE IS RELATIVELY
LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHMS DESPITE THE DISPARATE
MEANS BY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND BY WHICH THEY OPERATE.
BASIC LIBRARY SKILLS: A SHORT COURSE.
     
DESIGNED TO BE A SELF-CONTAINED SHORT COURSE IN THE USE OF THE LIBRARY FOR
NON-LIBRARIANS.
ON THE REALISATION OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AT A COLLEGE OF EDUCATION.
     
THE PROGRESS OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AT THE ERFURT/MULHAUSEN COLLEGE OF
EDUCATION WAS OUTLINED AT A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' STUDY GROUP
AT THE MINISTRY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION (MINISTERIUM FUR VOLKSBILDUNG) IN JUNE
80. IT HAS PROVED DIFFICULT TO INTEREST ALL THE TEACHERS AT THE COLLEGE IN THE
SUBJECT AND TO IMPRESS ON THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF USER TRAINING TO THE
STUDENTS. IT IS PLANNED TO HOLD MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS TO SHOW TEACHERS
METHODS OF USER TRAINING AND OF PUTTING THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE TO THE TEST.
STUDENT USER TRAINING CONSISTS OF A TOUR AROUND THE LIBRARY, AND LIBRARY
DEPARTMENTS, LECTURES IN COLLEGE AND AT THE LIBRARY AND PRACTICAL TESTS IN
USING CATALOGUES AND OTHER INFORMATION SOURCES. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY THE
STUDENTS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN WORKING INDEPENDENTLY IN THE CATALOGUE SECTION,
USING A WIDER RANGE OF REFERENCE LITERATURE AND PREPARING THEIR FINAL THESIS.

CONSEQUENT RECOMMENDATIONS.
     
MUCH OF THE MATERIAL IN THIS ARTICLE WAS PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED AS PART OF A
PAPER PREPARED FOR THE 2ND WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTATION,
BRUSSELS, 20-22 JUNE 80. SUMMARISES THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF THE STATUS OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF THE PUBLICATIONS ON UN ORGANISATIONS. DESCRIBES THE
MAIN TYPES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS BY WHICH UN ORGANISATIONS ANNOUNCE THEIR
PUBLICATIONS, AND ANALYSES THE COVERAGE PROVIDED BY THESE TOOLS. HIGHLIGHTS
THE NEED FOR THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRODUCTION, AND
SUGGESTS THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC STEPS WHICH COULD BE TAKEN TOWARDS THIS
COORDINATION' THE UTILISATION OF ON-LINE SERVICES AND WORD PROCESSING
CAPABILITIES; THE INVOLVEMENT OF PUBLICATION UNITS; PRIORITISING COVERAGE OF
THE DATA BASE; DECIDING ON ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION;
AND CATALOGUING-IN-PUBLICATION.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO CURRICULUM GUIDES.
     
CURRICULUM GUIDES ARE AN IMPORTANT AND HEAVILY USED RESOURCE IN EDUCATION
LIBRARIES AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS CENTRES. GAINING ACCESS TO THESE
MATERIALS, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING, AS MOST CURRICULUM
GUIDES HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN INDEXED IN A CENTRAL SOURCE. FEARON-PITMAN
PUBLISHERS INC. HAS ATTEMPTED TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION BY PUBLISHING THE
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT LIBRARY, THE 1ST SET OF WHICH CONTAINED 905 CURRICULUM
GUIDES ON MICROFICHE WITH HARD COPY INDEXES. THE PUBLISHER EXPECTS TO PUBLISH
THIS SET ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-ST. LOUIS OWNS THE
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT LIBRARY, AND THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES ITS USE IN THE
EDUCATION LIBRARY.

INFORMATION DATA. II. THE ISI-ASCA-BRAZIL DATA BANK, A NEW TOOL FOR ANALYSING
BRAZILIAN SCIENCE.
     
A REPORT BY 2 BRAZILIAN RESEARCH SCIENTISTS ON THE INITIATION OF A NEW STAGE
IN THEIR PROJECT. DISCUSSES THEIR WORK TO DATE IN THIS FIELD, WITH REFERENCE
TO PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS, ANALYSING THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN COLLECTING
DATA BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION IN 1977 OF THE ISI AUTOMATED SUBJECT CITATION
ALERT (ASCA). FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NEW SERVICES AVAILABLE, ENABLING
THE AUTHORS TO ELABORATE A SEARCH PROFILE TO RETRIEVE EVERY ARTICLE PUBLISHED
BY SCIENTISTS FROM BRAZILIAN INSTITUTIONS. THE METHOD OF PROFILE CONSTRUCTION
IS DESCRIBED, AND RESULTS AFTER 6 MONTHS EVALUATED IN RELATION TO SUCCESS IN
SOLVING PREVIOUS PROBLEMS, SHOWING HOW THE WAY IS NOW OPEN TO ESTABLISHING AN
INEXPENSIVE, MULTI-DISCIPLINARY, AND UP-TO-DATE DATA BASE ON BRAZILIAN
SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION. IN CONCLUSION THE USES FOR THIS DATA BASE ARE
DISCUSSED, AND SUGGESTIONS MADE FOR IMPROVING COMPREHENSIVENESS BY COVERING
AREAS OUTSIDE THE ISI'S SCOPE.
SDI SOFTWARE PACKAGE ON A MINICOMPUTER.
     
SINCE 1970, THE ISRAELI NATIONAL CENTRE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INFORMATION (COSTI) HAS BEEN PROVIDING A COMPUTERISED SDI SERVICE TO ACADEMIC,
RESEARCH, INDUSTRIAL, AND GOVERNMENTAL USERS. THE SERVICE IS RUN ON A PDP
11/70 MINICOMPUTER. IN MAR 81, 6 DATA BASES WERE BEING USED-CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS

EXTRACT FROM A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION IN INFORMATION SCIENCE, DESCRIBING AN
INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT IN THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION
DIVISION AT THE SAO PAULO INSTITUTE OF ATOMIC ENERGY, FOLLOWING THE CHANGE
OVER IN 1974 FROM A MANUAL TO AN AUTOMATED SERVICE. A SUMMARY OF THE
PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE RELATING TO RELEVANCE THEORIES, PREVIOUS
STUDIES, AND METHODOLOGY, IS PRESENTED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY,
BASED ON DOCUMENT TITLES, DEVELOPED FOR THIS STUDY TO RATE JUDGEMENTS AND
COLLECT DATA. RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN FULL AND ANALYSED; THE CALCULATION
PROCEDURES ARE EXPLAINED AND DEMONSTRATED. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT USER AND
NON-USER JUDGEMENTS WERE LARGELY SIMILAR; DISAGREEMENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE USER AND OBJECTIVE NON-USER EVALUATION
CRITERIA. FINALLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TITLES IN DETERMINING REL EVANCE WAS
CONSIDERED, AND THE CONCLUSION DRAWN THAT FREQUENCY OF PROFILE DESCRIPTORS IN
DOCUMENT TITLES DID NOT DIFFERENTIATE RELEVANT FROM NON-RELEVANT DOCUMENTS.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERLINGUAL COMMUNICATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,
20 NOV 80. WITH CLOSER ECONOMIC COOPERATION WORLDWIDE AND INCREASING NUMBERS
OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND MEETINGS THE COST OF TRANSLATION AND
INTERPRETING SERVICES MAY BECOME TOO HEAVY A BURDEN UNLESS SOLUTIONS FOR
REDUCING COSTS CAN BE FOUND. THERE IS A DANGER OF INTRODUCING NEW BARRIERS
INTO INTERLINGUAL COMMUNICATION RESULTING FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF SUCH AS DOCUMENTATION AND COMMAND LANGUAGES. DESCRIBES THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS. STANDARDISATION
AGREEMENTS ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED AMONG MANUFACTURERS OF HARDWARE, DESIGNERS OF
SOFTWARE, HOSTS OF DATA BASES AND PRODUCERS OF TRANSLATIONS AND TERMINOLOGY.
BRIEFLY OUTLINES NEW FORMS OF TRANSLATION THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE.

AIDS UNLIMITED' THE SCOPE FOR MACHINE AIDS IN A LARGE ORGANIZATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,
20 NOV 80. EXAMINES THE TYPES OF MACHINE AID WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR USE IN A
LARGE TRANSLATING OPERATION SUCH AS THOSE MET IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
INSTITUTIONS. REVIEWS THE WAY IN WHICH THESE MACHINE AIDS ARE ALREADY BEING
USED IN LARGE ORGANISATIONS AND EXAMINES THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY CAN BE OF
BENEFIT TO THE RUNNING OF THE WHOLE ORGANISATION. WARNS OF POSSIBLE
DIFFICULTIES IN INTRODUCING THEM. IF THESE DIFFICULTIES CAN BE OVERCOME, MANY
ADVANTAGES CAN BE GAINED IN A LARGE ORGANISATION BY INTRODUCING A
FULLY-INTEGRATED WORD-PROCESSING SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL TEXTS ARE STORED IN
ELECTRONIC ARCHIVES AND CAN BE TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY FROM 1 WORK STATION
TO ANOTHER, AND FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
MACHINE AIDS' A SMALL USER'S REACTION.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND LIBRARIES.
     
STANDARDISATION WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION COMMUNITY IS DEFINED AND
THEN CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FROM AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY,
FACTORS CAUSING STANDARDISATION, AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF STANDARDS. CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A VIABLE MECHANISM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS, BUT THAT THERE IS LACKING NOT ONLY A BASIC
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS MECHANISM AND THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDS BY THE
INFORMATION COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO THE NECESSARY COMMITMENT AND INVOLVEMENT
CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL STANDARDISATION.
THE USBC AND CONTROL OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASE.
     
A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN BY THE USE OF ISBN FOR COMPUTERISED
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS. THE NEED FOR A CONTROL NUMBER THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO
MISAPPLICATION EITHER BY HUMAN ERROR OR THROUGH FAULTS IN ITS STRUCTURE HAS
LED TO THE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSAL STANDARD BOOK CODE (USBC). THE STRUCTURE
AND FUNCTION OF USBC IS DESCRIBED BRIEFLY AND THE ABILITY OF USBC TO DETECT
DUPLICATES IN DATA BASES IS HIGHLIGHTED.
OCLC-MARC TAPES AND COLLECTION MANAGEMENT.
     
OCLC-MARC SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE TAPES CAN BE USED AS A CONVENIENT SOURCE OF
STATISTICAL DATA FOR COLLECTION MANAGEMENT. NEW ACQUISITIONS CAN BE ANALYSED
BY USING MONTHLY AND ANNUAL CUMULATIVE TAPES. INFORMATION OBTAINABLE INCLUDES
GENERAL STATISTICS SUCH AS NUMBERS OF NEW TITLES ADDED BY SUBJECTS, TYPES OF
MATERIALS, LANGUAGES OF THE TEXT, AND INTELLECTUAL LEVELS. USING BOOLEAN
OPERATORS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERATE STATISTICS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF
CHEMISTRY HANDBOOKS PUBLISHED AFTER 1970, ART HISTORY BOOKS WRITTEN IN THE
SPANISH LANGUAGE FILMSTRIPS TREATING AMERICAN HISTORY SUITED FOR CHILDREN,
ETC.
CENTRAL STOCK ACQUISITION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN 1982.
     
THIS PRACTICE, CARRIED OUT BY THE CZECH MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND NOW WELL
ESTABLISHED, DOES NOT REPLACE PUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCK ACQUISITION, BUT IS
INTENDED TO HELP IN THOSE FIELDS WHERE THE LIBRARIES ARE TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN
REALISATION OF THE STATE CULTURAL POLICY. THE FUNDS ARE NOT SMALL; THE SUM
INVOLVED IS MORE THAN 3 MILLION CROWNS. THE SELECTION OF TITLES AND READERS
SERVICES CONCERNING THIS LITERATURE ARE EXPLAINED.
USE OF A CATALOGING CENTER'S BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS AS A MEANS TO CHECK AND
BALANCE ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITIES AT AN ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY.
     
THE ACQUISITIONS STAFF AT WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY'S SHIFFMAN MEDICAL LIBRARY
HAS DEVELOPED A VALIDATION SYSTEM BASED ON THE REQUESTS FOR CATALOGUING FROM
THE 5 TEACHING HOSPITALS WHICH ARE MEMBERS OF THE DETROIT COOPERATIVE
CATALOGING CENTER (DC3). DC3 PROVIDES DATA ON MEMBERS' ACQUISITION ACTIVITES
WHICH HAVE ASSISTED IN POINTING UP DEFICIENCIES IN SHIFFMAN'S BOOK BUDGET, AND
IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF SELECTIVE PURCHASING IN THE FACE OF FISCAL
CONSTRAINTS. THIS SYSTEM IS BEING USED TO GENERATE THE KIND OF INFORMATION
NEEDED BY BOTH ACQUISITIONS LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN ORDER TO
MAKE INFORMED COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
CHOOSING AND USING BOOKS IN THE FIRST SCHOOL.
     
PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE CHOOSING OF BOOKS TO SUIT THE READING NEEDS, IN THE
SCHOOL LIBRARY, OF CHILDREN UNDER 9 YEARS OLD.
BUILDING LIBRARY COLLECTIONS.
     
ANALYSES COLLECTION-DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN 7 US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES, DRAWING ON 2 THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES-ANALYSES OF THE STRUCTURE AND
FUNCTION OF COMPLEX ORGANISATIONS AND ANALYSES OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION. 340
ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, FACULTY MEMBERS, AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY
ADMINISTRATORS WERE INTERVIEWED, FIELD OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE, AND MATERIAL
WAS COLLECTED FROM STATISTICAL SUMMARIES AND REPORTS. THIS WORK IS INTENDED TO
MAKE A BASIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE SOCIAL SCIENCE STUDY OF COMPLEX
ORGANISATIONS.
MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE PRINT HANDICAPPED-MORE THAN RAMPS AND
SLIDING DOORS.
     
PRESENTS THE VIEW THAT THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED ARE EQUAL IN
SCOPE TO THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT LIBRARIANS SHOULD DEVELOP COLLECTIONS
IN THE FORMATS NECESSARY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. FOCUSES ON THE BASIC COMPONENTS
NECESSARY TO BUILDING AND ORGANISING COLLECTIONS AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS TO
BE ENCOUNTERED.
THE AMERICAN TRUST FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY.
     
THE AIMS OF THE AMERICAN TRUST FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY WERE ORIGINALLY TO
ENABLE THE BL TO AUGMENT ITS HOLDINGS OF AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS FROM THE 1880S
TO THE 1950S AND TO REPLACE BOOKS STILL MISSING FROM WORLD WAR 2 LOSSES. THE
ROLE OF ATBL IN THE PROMOTION OF AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE UK IS DISCUSSED.
EFFECT OF ONLINE SERVICES ON PURCHASE OF A PRINTED INDEX.
     
REVIEWS THE TREND OF PURCHASING OF A PRINTED INDEX (2INDEX MEDICUS1) WITHIN
THE SOUTH WEST THAMES REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY (UK). SHOWS THAT AS THE
MACHINE READABLE COUNTERPART (MEDLINE) HAS BECOME MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE THE
PURCHASE AND USE OF 2INDEX MEDICUS1 HAS INCREASED RATHER THAN DIMINISHED.
REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL INFORMATION NUCLEUS IN NORTH EAST
BRAZIL.
     
TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEMS OF ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK,
THE EXISTING INFORMATION RESOURCES IN BRAZIL'S NORTHEAST WERE INVESTIGATED.
DATA OBTAINED FROM THE 2BRAZILIAN STATISTICAL ANNUAL1 AND THE BRAZILIAN
2NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS1 SHOWED THAT COMPARED TO OTHER
REGIONS, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY WELL ENDOWED WITH LIBRARIES, THE NORTHEAST IS
INADEQUATELY SUPPLIED WITH PERIODICALS, AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF COLLECTIONS
ARE INCOMPLETE OR DUPLICATED. A PLANNED ACQUISITION PROGRAMME FOR SERIALS,
BACKED BY AN ORGANISED INTERLIBRARY LOAN POLICY, IS RECOMMENDED, TOGETHER WITH
INVESTIGATIONS TO ESTABLISH USER NEEDS AND PERIODICAL USAGE, AS ESSENTIAL
PRELIMINARIES FOR NETWORK PLANNING.
USE FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL FOR ILL.
     
THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL BY THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST BIBLIOGRAPHIC CENTER TO
TRANSMIT INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS TO AND FROM MEMBER LIBRARIES IS DESCRIBED.
ON THE INTERLIBRARY LOAN MAP.
     
IN QUESTIONNAIRE REPLIES, FEW READERS AT THE OPOCHKA REGIONAL LIBRARY KNEW OF
THE INTERLIBRARY LOANS SYSTEM, (ILS). THE REGIONAL LIBRARY'S DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE BIBLIOGRAPHERS PRODUCE INFORMATION LISTS ON NEW
ACCESSIONS, SO THE REASON CANNOT BE LACK OF INFORMATION ON AGRICULTURAL
PUBLICATIONS. INDIVIDUAL WORK WITH READERS IS NECESSARY TO DISCOVER THEIR TRUE
REQUIREMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME LIBRARIES CONSIDER THE ILS AN OPTIONAL
BURDEN. UNDER ILS RULES FICTION AND EDUCATIONAL BOOKS ARE DISPATCHED ONLY FOR
SCIENTIFIC AND PRODUCTIVE WORK. PROBLEMS ARISE IN DEFINING 'EDUCATIONAL'
BOOKS. FROM JULY 81 A STATE STANDARD WILL APPEAR CONCERNING A UNIFIED ILS AND
INTRODUCING CERTAIN CHANGES.
THE IMPACT OF THE OCLC INTERLIBRARY SUBSYSTEM ON A SCIENCE ORIENTED ACADEMIC
LIBRARY.
     
ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED FOR 1 YEAR OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY'S USE OF OCLC AS A BORROWER, AS WELL AS A LENDER. THE
KNOWLEDGE OF LOCATION OF ITEMS IN A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARIES HAS MADE INTERLOAN
REQUEST COMMUNICATIONS FOR BOOKS EASIER, QUICKER, AND MORE PRECISE. REQUESTS
BY CALTECH FOR JOURNAL ARTICLES, REPORTS, ETC. ARE NOT HANDLED VIA OCLC.
REQUESTS RECEIVED FROM OTHER LIBRARIES SHOW SOME LACK OF DISCRIMINATION BY
SPECIFYING ITEMS NOT SHOWN AS AT CALTECH OR BY ASKING FOR RECENTLY PUBLISHED
BOOKS. HOWEVER, THE VOLUME OF SUCH REQUESTS IS SMALL.
AUTOMATED INTERLIBRARY LOANS.
     
BEN AN SSSR, (USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES NATURAL SCIENCES LIBRARY), (ASNS), USES
FOR INTERLIBRARY LOANS THE NATURAL SCIENCES STOCK OF 50 MOSCOW LEARNED
LIBRARIES; THIS NECESSITATED AN AUTOMATED PROCESS. ASNS HAS AUTOMATED ITS
SERVICE CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF REQUESTS, THEIR PROCESSING, AND OVERDUES. A
COMPUTER PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE PROGRESS OF LOAN REQUESTS AND STATISTICAL
DATA ON INTERLIBRARY LOANS. A SPECIAL TRIPLICATE ORDER FORM PERMITS THE
INTRODUCTION OF INFORMATION INTO THE COMPUTER WITHOUT PRE-MACHINE PROCESSING.
A MACHINE CALENDAR SCANS LOAN PERIODS. OWING TO COMPUTERISATION ASNS HAS
ELIMINATED 2 CARD INDEXES RECORDING INTERLIBRARY LOANS, (60,000 CARDS P.A.),
AND FREED STAFF FOR OTHER WORK. ASNS PLANS TO INTRODUCE AUTOMATION INTO OTHER
SECTIONS.
NO GRANDFATHER CLAUSE: REAPPRAISING ACCESSIONED RECORDS.
     
EVERY PUBLIC RECORDS REPOSITORY HAS ON ITS SHELVES RECORDS WHICH, IF OFFERED
TODAY, WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE, AND YET SHELF SPACE IS STILL PROVIDED FOR THEM.
FOR SUCH RECORDS THERE SHOULD BE NO 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSE'. DISCUSSES THE
REASONS FOR THE KEEPING OF RECORDS OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE, AND SUGGESTS A
REAPPRAISAL PROCEDURE, WITH AN INTERVAL OF REAPPRAISAL OF PERHAPS 20 TO 30
YEARS. DISCUSSES APPRAISAL METHODS, STRESSING THE CARE THAT MUST BE TAKEN IF
UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT RECORDS ARE NOT TO BE DESTROYED.
SAMPLING IN ARCHIVES' AN ESSAY ILLUSTRATING THE VALUE OF MATHEMATICALLY BASED
SAMPLING AND THE USAGE OF TECHNIQUES OTHER THAN SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING WITHIN
ARCHIVES; OR, COPING WITH 10,000 FEET OF INVOICES BEFORE RETIREMENT.
     
DISCUSSES WHAT SAMPLING IS, REFUTING THE CLAIM THAT ARCHIVAL SAMPLING AND
MATHEMATICAL SAMPLING ARE DISTINCT AND SEPARATE METHODS; ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM
OF IMPLEMENTATION, IN PARTICULAR TO SUGGEST AN ALTERNATE TECHNQIUE TO SIMPLE
RANDOM SAMPLING; AND DEMONSTRATES THE LEGITIMACY OF SAMPLING BY REPORTING THE
RESULTS OF IT CARRIED OUT ON A TYPICAL ARCHIVAL RECORD GROUP, OF KNOWN VALUES.
A STUDY OF THE PROGNOSES OF LIBRARY EDUCATORS AND PRESERVATIONISTS ON
CONSERVATION TRAINING AND THE LIBRARY SCHOOL.
     
(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY). A STUDY OF THE FUTURE OF CONSERVATION
OF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVE MATERIALS AS VIEWED BY 2 GROUPS OF EXPERTS-PEOPLE
CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THE FIELD OF CONSERVATION AND REGULAR LIBRARY SCHOOL
FACULTY MEMBERS. ASKS WHETHER PRESERVATIONISTS AND LIBRARY EDUCATORS SEE THE
FUTURE IN SIMILAR FASHIONS AND WHETHER THEIR FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS ARE HELD
STRONGLY ENOUGH TO AFFECT THEIR ROLES IN PROVIDING CONSERVATION TRAINING.
ST INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON THE PROBLEMS OF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION IN
NATIONAL LIBRARIES.G
     
IVES A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON THE 'PROBLEMS OF
CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF NATIONAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS' HELD 16-21 JUNE
80 AT THE DEUTSCHE BUCHEREI IN LEIPZIG. SPECIALISTS FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND
THE USSR MET TO DISCUSS CURRENT NATIONAL POLICIES ON THE PRESERVATION OF
NATIONAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS AND METHODS OF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF
BOOKS, PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS. A RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED TO INCREASE
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THESE FIELDS. IN PRACTICE THIS WILL MEAN HOLDING
REGULAR MEETINGS AND A SYSTEMATIC EXCHANGE OF THE LATEST RESEARCH RESULTS AND
TECHNOLOGY AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE COMECON. GREATER PARTICIPATION IN RELEVANT
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, ESPECIALLY IFLA, IS ALSO IMPORTANT.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE CHIEF CONSERVATION OFFICER' THE CHALLENGE IS IMMENSE.
     
DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE MAIN CONSERVATION NEEDS OF THE HUMANITIES RESEARCH
CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN, AND DESCRIBES WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO
FAR TO MEET THEM, INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONSERVATION COMMITTEE
COMPRISED OF VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AT THE CENTER, AND THE INITIATION OF A
TRAINING PROGRAMME FOR THE CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL MATERIALS.
GRANT FUNDS PROVIDE IMPETUS FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAM.
     
RESEARCH LIBRARIES EVERYWHERE FACE THE PROBLEM OF CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS. FUNDING FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS, IN THE PAST FEW YEARS,
STIMULATED RESEARCH, SPECIAL PROJECTS, AND PROGRAMMES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL
CONSERVATION ADVISORY COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL PRESERVATION PROGRAM IN THE
USA. MORRIS LIBRARY, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, HAS EMBARKED UPON A
COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAMME FOR ITS COLLECTIONS WITH GRANT FUNDS FROM
SEVERAL FUNDING BODIES. ITS PROGRAMME IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. COMMITTED TO
CONSERVATION ON A BROAD SCALE, THE UNIVERSITY AND MORRIS LIBRARY SUPPORT
EFFORTS AIMED AT PRESERVING AND MAINTAINING RESEARCH MATERIALS VITAL TO THE
UNIVERSITY'S EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PROGRAMMES, AND THE SCHOLARLY COMMUNITY
AT LARGE.
EITHER WE MOVE OR ELSE WE STOP ACCEPTING MORE BOOKS.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEPOSIT LIBRARY AND ITS SPACE PROBLEMS. UNLESS THE LIBRARY MOVES
FROM ITS PRESENT ACCOMMODATION IN THE BASEMENT OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WITHIN
HALF A YEAR, IT WILL HAVE TO START REFUSING BOOKS FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE
LIBRARY'S PURPOSE IS TO STORE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CULLED FROM PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AND TO LEND OR GIVE THEM TO OTHER LIBRARIES, AND THEREFORE IT MUST
NECESSARILY GROW AT A TIME WHEN OTHER LIBRARIES CONTRACT. THE LIBRARY BEGAN IN
1968 WITH 1400 SQ.M.; LATER A FURTHER 175 SQ.M. WERE ADDED FOR SHELVING AND
1000 SQ.M. IN A WAREHOUSE ELSEWHERE. A SUITABLE BUILDING OF 7700 SQ.M. IS NOW
AVAILABLE CHEAPLY. WITH AN INCREASE OF 25,000 VOLUMES A YEAR, THIS WOULD
SECURE ENOUGH SPACE UNTIL THE 90S. RUNNING COSTS WILL BE 5.1 MILLION KR. IN 82
AS COMPARED TO THE PRESENT 3.6 MILLION KR., AND COST OF ESTABLISHMENT WILL BE
2.7 MILLION KR. THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE LIBRAR Y COUNCIL HAVE NOW RECOMMENDED THAT THE MONEY
SHOULD COME FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES' DISPOSITION FUND, NOT OTHERWISE USED
FOR SUCH PURPOSES, AS THE SOURCE OF THE LIBRARY'S FINANCE, THE PUBLIC
LIBRARIES' JOINT APPROPRIATION, WOULD BE UNABLE TO COPE. THE LIBRARY IS A LAST
RESORT, AFTER THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE FOR THE LENDING OF
OLDER BOOKS AND MEETS 55% OF ENQUIRIES, A FIGURE WHICH WOULD BE HIGHER IF A
CATALOGUE OF HOLDINGS EXISTED.
TURNKEY SYSTEMS FOR LIBRARY CIRCULATION CONTROL' AN INTRODUCTION.
     
REVIEWS THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION CONTROL AND
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TURNKEY SYSTEMS AS AN INTRODUCTION TO A DETAILED
DISCUSSION OF 5 TURNKEY SYSTEMS (P.87-125).
THE ISSUE CONTROL IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.
     
STATEMENTS BY THE DANISH LIBRARIANS' UNION SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS AND ISSUE DESKS, WHERE OFFICE TRAINED
STAFF, NOT LIBRARIANS, WORK; THEY THEREFORE TEND TO REJECT AUTOMATION IN THESE
AREAS. THEY ARE, ON THE OTHER HAND, TRAINED IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES AND
HENCE APPROVE OF AUTOMATION OF THESE. THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT PRESENT
MANUAL ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING VERY POORLY' BOOKS ARE BEING RECALLED
WHICH ARE ALREADY RETURNED OR HAVE NEVER BEEN BORROWED. REFERS TO A NEGLECTED
REPORT OF 1979 BY A COMMITTEE OF HEADS OF ISSUE DESKS, WHICH RECOMMENDS
EXPERIMENTS WITH AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTS AN
AUTOMATIC RECALL SYSTEM. THE ISSUE DESK STAFF OF THE AUTOMATED OLSTYKKE
LIBRARY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED POSITIVE VIEWS ON THEIR AUTOMATIC SYSTEM, VIEWS
FOR WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN REPRIMANDED BY THE LIBRARIANS' UNION.
COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION.
     
REPORT OF A 1980 STUDY VISIT TO 11 AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ANALYSING THE
PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN INSTALLING AN AUTOMATED LOAN SYSTEM. THE DISCUSSION
COVERS THE PREPARATION AND INPUT OF USER DATA; METHODS OF CONVERTING
CATALOGUES; AND PROCEDURES FOR ACCESSING FILES AND RECORDING TRANSACTIONS.
CONSIDERS THE ADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATION, AND THE ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS OF
SUCH SYSTEMS IN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS.
EFFICIENT FINDING AIDS' DEVELOPING A SYSTEM FOR CONTROL OF ARCHIVES AND
MANUSCRIPTS.
     
DESCRIBES SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EASE
AND EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH ARCHIVAL FINDING AIDS CAN BE PRODUCED, MAINTAINED
AND USED. A CONTEMPLATION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE AUTOMATION MIGHT BE A WAY TO
BRING SUCH PRACTICES INTO FOCUS AND DEVELOP A RATIONALE FOR THEIR SYSTEMATIC
APPLICATION.
FINDING AIDS' A MULTI-MEDIA, SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE.
     
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION OF FINDING AIDS FOR ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. THE
TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTION THAT THE FINDING AID IS PREPARED BY AN INDIVIDUAL
REPOSITORY IS TOO INSULAR. THE PERSPECTIVE MUST EXPAND TO INCLUDE FINDING AIDS
RELATED TO ACCUMULATIONS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, MACHINE-READABLE FILES, ORAL HISTORY
TAPES AND TRANSCRIPTS, MOTION PICTURES AND SIMILAR MEDIA, AND NOT MERELY
TRADITIONAL PAPER RECORDS. EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCH
MULTI-MEDIA FINDING AIDS.
ON SOME PROBLEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING AT THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
LIBRARY.
     
THE WISMAR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING LIBRARY USES A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE FOR
SUBJECT CATALOGUING WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 1970. IT IS BASED ON THE
HIERARCHIC UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF THE ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
THIS IS SUITABLE FOR THE STOCK OF THE WISMAR LIBRARY WHICH COVERS A VERY WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE HAS A FLEXIBLE NOTATION SYSTEM
WHICH CAN COVER COMPLEX TERMS EXTENDING TO 6 COLUMNS AND ALSO HAS KEYWORDS'
GENERAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, CHRONOLOGICAL, LINGUISTIC AND LITERATURE. THE
SYSTEMATICS WORK AT THE WISMAR LIBRARY HAS SEVERAL OBJECTIVES' TO ADAPT THE
ROSTOCK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION TO THE SPECIALISED
WISMAR COLLECTION; TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM SCIENTIFIC
DEVELOPMENTS BY EXPANDING AND BRINGING UP TO DATE THE SCHEDULES; AND TO WORK
OUT NEW SYSTEMS IN CASES WHERE THE LIMITS OF EXISTING ONES ARE REACHED. WHERE
THIS HAS BEEN NECESSARY 2 C ATALOGUES HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN EXISTENCE
SIMULTANEOUSLY TO AVOID LOSS OF INFORMATION FOR THE USER.
DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS OF VISUAL RESOURCES' THE METHODS USED TO DATE.
     
A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT, BASED ON RECENT LITERATURE COVERING' DIFFICULTIES IN
ANALYSING IMAGES FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES; CATALOGUING AND SUBJECT HEADINGS,
WITH REFERENCE TO LISTS AND ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUES PREPARED BY SPECIAL
LIBRARIES; THE CLASSIFICATION OF IMAGES, IN RELATION TO THE INADEQUACY OF
CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR SLIDE COLLECTIONS, ARCHIVAL
CLASSIFICATIONS, AND CLASSIFICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES; AND INDEXING
PROCEDURES USED BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE FIELDS OF PETROLEUM, MANAGEMENT
AND URBAN PLANNING, MEDICINE, EDUCATION, ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HISTORY OF ART,
THE PLASTIC ARTS, AND METHODS DEVELOPED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SEMIOLOGICAL
CONNOTATIONS OF IMAGES. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES ARE PROVIDED FOR ALL
METHODS AND SYSTEMS REFERRED TO. THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO DEVELOP
WHOLLY SATISFACTORY TECHNIQUES IS EMPHASISED.
ON THE ACCESS TO CARTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS IN GDR LIBRARIES.
     
SUITABLE CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION OF CARTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS OFFERS THE
USER EASIER ACCESS TO THESE MATERIALS AND OFFERS THE LIBRARIAN A FUNDAMENTAL
BASIS FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION AND PROMOTING OPTIMAL USE OF HIS COLLECTIONS.
HERE, THE METHODS OF CLASSIFICATION WHICH ARE USED IN EAST GERMANY ARE
LINEATED USING EXAMPLES FROM THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MAP COLLECTIONS.
AUTHORITY CONTROL' UNNECESSARY DETAIL OF NEEDED SUPPORT?.
     
AUTHORITY CONTROL IS THE SET OF PROCEDURES WHICH DETERMINES THE USE OF
CONSISTENT NAMES AND TERMINOLOGY, CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SCHOLARLY
DISCIPLINES, CORPORATE BODIES, AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. GIVES EXAMPLES OF
AUTHORITY WORK FOR PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE NAMES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,
SERIES TITLES AND SUBJECT HEADINGS. SUGGESTS THAT AUTHORITY CONTROL IS
ESSENTIAL BECAUSE' CATALOGUES ARE GROWING AND BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO USE
SO THE USER MAY EASILY GET LOST WITHOUT AN AUTHORITY STRUCTURE TO PROVIDE
GUIDANCE; AND IF LIBRARIES FOLLOW GENERALLY THE SAME STANDARDS IN ESTABLISHING
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS, THE TASK OF MATCHING RECORDS AMONG LIBRARIES WILL BE
MADE CONSIDERABLY EASIER.
THE MALAYSIAN MARC (MALMARC) PROJECT.
     
THE MALAYSIAN MARC (MALMARC) PROJECT, WHICH IS ONE OF 5 COOPERATIVE PROGRAMMES
INVOLVING THE 5 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MALAYSIA,
CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE DEVELOPING MALAYSIAN RESEARCH LIBRARY
NETWORK. THE PROJECT BEGAN IN OCT 77 AS AN EXPERIMENT AS A RESULT OF A
FEASIBILITY STUDY, AND BECAME AN OPERATIONAL SYSTEM IN JULY 79. DURING THE
EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD, COSTING STUDIES WERE UNDERTAKEN AND THESE REVEALED THAT
FOR ALL THE PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS, AN AUTOMATED CATALOGUING SYSTEM WAS
CHEAPER THAN THE MANUAL SYSTEM. THE MALMARC SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY BEING OPERATED
BY THE MALMARC COORDINATING CENTRE AT THE UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA. DETAILS
OF THE SYSTEM TOGETHER WITH FLOWCHARTS ARE PROVIDED. THE HUMAN AND TECHNICAL
PROBLEMS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF OUTLINE OF FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS.
WHAT'S IN COOPERATIVES FOR ME?.
     
OUTLINES SOME OF THE DRAWBACKS TO LIBRARIES WHO JOIN COOPERATIVES FOR
CENTRALISED COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING (E.G. BLCMP, SWALCAP).
TECHNICAL REPORT ON LINKING THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES' BENEFITS AND COSTS.
     
(REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE US COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES.) PRESENTS THE
FINDINGS OF AN EXAMINATION OF THE METHODS, BENEFITS AND COSTS OF LINKING THE
'BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES', FOCUSING ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES: (1) OCLC,
RLG/RLIN, WLN AND THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS WERE CONSIDERED INITIAL CANDIDATES
FOR LINKING; (2) ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS FOR PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES OF LINKING 2 OR MORE UTILITIES; (3) THE ANALYSIS WAS RESTRICTED TO
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR MONOGRAPHS; (4) ASSESSED THE IMPACT OF LINKING ON
SHARED CATALOGUING, INTERLIBRARY LOAN, AND REFERENCE SEARCHING; (5) EXAMINED
THE BENEFITS OF THE LC CATALOGUING FUNCTION; AND (6) THE TECHNICAL EVALUATION
CONCENTRATED ON LINK ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE TODAY AND
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE NEXT 3 OR 4 YEARS.
NETWORK SERVICE CENTERS AND THEIR EXPANDING ROLE.
     
THE GROWTH OF OCLC AS AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY RESOURCE-SHARING SYSTEM HAS BEEN
MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY INTERMEDIARY ORGANISATIONS, OR NETWORKS, THAT
FUNCTION AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING AGENTS FOR OCLC SERVICES. AS THEY HAVE
GROWN, THE NETWORKS HAVE TAKEN ON OTHER ROLES. THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF THE
DIRECTORS OF THE NETWORKS REVEAL PATTERNS OF SERVICE BEYOND OCLC, AND INDICATE
THAT THE NETWORKS PROVIDE, OR PLAN TO PROVIDE, AUTOMATED LIBRARY SUPPORT
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. SURVEY RESULTS ALSO REVEAL BROKERAGE OF OTHER AUTOMATED
SERVICES, NETWORKS' REVENUE SOURCES, STAFF SIZE AND GROWTH, AND FUTURE PLANS.
ENTRY OF LOCAL DATA ON OCLC' THE OPTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OF
ARCHIVAL TAPES.
     
THE OCLC SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN ENTERING INSTITUTION
SPECIFIC DATA FOR AN ITEM. IN THE PAST, POLICIES FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA HAVE
BEEN FORMULATED IN MANY LIBRARIES ON THE BASIS OF CATALOGUE CARD APPEARANCE,
BUT THE INCREASING USE OF OCLC TAPE PRODUCTS REQUIRES REEXAMINATION OF MANY OF
THE LOCAL DATA PRACTICES NOW IN USE. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF
VARIATIONS FOR ENTERING LOCAL DATA ON THE PART OF BCR OCLC LIBRARIES. THE
RESULTS ARE PRESENTED HERE, ALONG WITH A DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES
AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PROCESSING OF OCLC TAPES.
CONSER' AN INTERNATIONAL PROJECT.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSER-AN INTERNATIONAL PROJECT TO CONVERT
RETROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT SERIAL RECORDS OF US AND CANADIAN LIBRARIES INTO A
MACHINE READABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE. DISCUSSES BRIEFLY' THE USE OF THE CONSER
DATA BASE FOR SERIALS CATALOGUING; SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THE
PROJECT; AND EXPANSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
THE ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING PROJECT LIMBA/DALIS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
RECENT INCREASES IN PUBLIC LIBRARY READERSHIP AND LOANS DEMAND MORE
RATIONALISATION. THE LIMBA PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH THE PRODUCTION BY
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING OF GUARD CATALOGUES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THE BOOK
FORM BEING CONSIDERED MORE COMPACT AND PORTABLE THAN CARD FILES. EACH VOLUME
IS PLANNED IN 3 SECTIONS, NAMELY' SCIENCE AND OTHER NON-FICTION; FICTION; AND
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. THE CONTENTS, CORRESPONDING WITH LIBRARY STOCKS IN
LARGE BRANCH LIBRARIES, WILL BE KEPT UP TO DATE BY THE PUBLICATION OF
CUMULATIVE SUPPLEMENTS EVERY 6 MONTHS. NEW COMPLETE EDITIONS ARE PLANNED EVERY
2 YEARS. THE BOOK CATALOGUES ARE INTENDED TO REPLACE CARD CATALOGUES IN
BRANCHES, SMALL MUNICIPAL AND RURAL LIBRARIES AND IN TRADE UNION LIBRARIES.
LIMBA'S DATA BANK FILE DALIS IS THE 1ST STAGE OF A COMPLETE ELECTRONIC DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM PLANNED FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON TECHNICAL PROCESSING.
     
EVALUATES THE IMPACT OF AACR2 AND THE CLOSING OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CARD
CATALOGUE ON CATALOGUING AND OTHER TECHNICAL PROCESSING ROUTINES BOTH IN
ALDERMAN LIBRARY AND ITS BRANCHES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION AT A TWO-YEAR COLLEGE.
     
RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION OF THE HOLDINGS, AT MIAMI UNIVERSITY AT HAMILTON
LIBRARY, INTO MACHINE-READABLE FORM VIA THE OCLC SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED. RESULTS
OF A TEST CONVERSION ARE GIVEN AND INDICATE THAT 7.32 YEARS WOULD BE NEEDED
FOR COMPLETE CONVERSION.
USER SURVEY OF A MICROFICHE CATALOGUE.
     
DESCRIBES BRIEFLY THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY, CARRIED OUT BY STUDENTS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF VANCOUVER, SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP, TO ASSESS USER'S ATTITUDES
TO THE LIBRARY'S MICROFICHE CATALOGUE.
PROBLEMS IN APPLYING AACR2 TO MUSIC MATERIALS.
     
SUCCESSIVE REVISIONS IN CATALOGUING CODES HAVE POSED SPECIAL PROBLEMS FOR
MUSIC MATERIALS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS OF MUSIC PUBLISHING HAVE
DICTATED TRADITIONAL DEPARTURES IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION. THE ADOPTION OF
AACR2 ADDITIONALLY FOCUSES ON THE UNIQUE PROBLEM OF PARTICIPATORY CREATION IN
MUSIC; THE PERFORMER AS AUTHOR. STUDIES THE IMPACT OF THESE PHENOMENA ON
CERTAIN MATTERS OF DESCRIPTION, ACCESS POINTS, AND UNIFORM TITLES.
AUTHORS AND NAMES' MULTIPLE PSEUDONYMS IN AACR2.
     
THE HISTORY OF CATALOGUING PSEUDONYMS IS REVIEWED. AACR2 REVERSES A
CENTURY-LONG CATALOGUING PRACTICE BY ALLOWING AUTHORS WHO USE SEVERAL
PSEUDONYMS TO BE ENTERED IN THE CATALOGUE UNDER EACH NAME. THIS VIOLATES THE
CATALOGUE'S OBJECTIVES AS FORMULATED BY LUBETZKY AND IS CONTRADICTORY TO
AACR2'S OWN INTERNAL LOGIC. THE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGES TO THIS RULE FAR
OUTWEIGH ANY ADVANTAGES. IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.
REMARKS ON THE PRE-PRINT OF RAK-WB.
     
THE RAK-WB (REGELN FUR DIE ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG IN
'WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN')-RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING IN
RESEARCH LIBRARIES-HAVE BEEN COMPILED TO CORRESPOND TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATION
IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND FULFIL THEIR PURPOSE WHICH IS TO BRIDGE THE TIME GAP
UNTIL RAK IS PUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM. RAK-WB PROVIDES A BASIS FOR CATALOGUING
IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES DEMONSTRATING THE DESIRED UNIFORMITY IN ALL IMPORTANT
POINTS. ITS USE WILL LEAD TO UNIFORM PROCESSING AT ALL STAGES OF
CLASSIFICATION WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING AND DATA
EXCHANGE. ITS VALUE IS INCREASED BY THE MANY AMENDMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS WHICH
WENT INTO ITS MAKE-UP AS A RESULT OF YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RAK.
RAK-WB HAS BEEN QUICKLY ADOPTED BY THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS.
IT IS HOPED THAT THE PLANNED RAK-OB FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL BE OF A
COMPARABLE STANDARD.
UNION CATALOGUES OF MUSIC PERIODICALS.
     
COLLECTION OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE IAML ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SALZBURG, 1-7
JULY 79. COMPRISES AN INTRODUCTION BY IMOGEN FELLINGER; 2THE BRITISH UNION
CATALOGUE OF MUSIC PERIODICALS, 1BY ANTHONY HODGES; TOWARDS A DUTCH UNION
CATALOGUE OF MUSIC PERIODICALS, BY CHARLOTTE VAN DER POT; AND PRESENT
ACTIVITIES REGARDING UNION CATALOGUES OF PERIODICALS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC
OF GERMANY AND BERLIN (WEST).
LIST OF UNION CATALOGUES OF (MUSIC) PERIODICALS.
     
LIST PROVIDES INFORMATION ON 54 UNION CATALOGUES OF MUSIC PERIODICALS AND
UNION CATALOGUES OF PERIODICALS WHICH INCLUDE MUSIC AND MUSIC-RELATED
PERIODICALS FROM 30 COUNTRIES.
MORE ABOUT SUBJECT CATALOGUING.
     
THE ITALIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION NEEDS TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE IN 1 OF ITS
CONGRESSES' WHAT PRACTICAL VALUE HAVE SERRAI'S PROPOSITIONS AND DEDUCTIONS ON
THE THESAURI COMPILED BY SPECIALISTS AND AT WHAT STAGE THEY ARE PREFERABLE TO
THE CURRENT SUBJECT LIST NOTORIOUSLY OMITTED FROM THE UNIQUE CATALOGUE;
ENQUIRY, CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE INDISCRIMINATE ABUSE OF THE
PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS; CRITICISM AND DISCRIMINATORY REVISION ON THE PREEMINENCE
OR OTHERWISE OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL SUBJECTS; REVISION OF THE ORGANISATIONAL AND
DISTRIBUTIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE CATALOGUING INSTITUTE; AND TO WHAT EXTENT
SUBJECT CATALOGUING CAN MAKE USE OF ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTERS WITHOUT
FORGETTING THAT ORIGINAL INSPIRATION STEMS ONLY FROM THE HUMAN BRAIN.
MEASURES OF CONSISTENCY IN INDEXING' INTERCONSISTENCY.
     
REPORT OF A BRAZILIAN STUDY BASED ON POSTGRADUATE COURSE WORK IN INFORMATION
SCIENCE, DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE CONSISTENCY OF PERFORMANCE BY A GROUP OF
INDEXERS IN SELECTING TERMS TO REPRESENT DOCUMENT CONTENT. A PRELIMINARY
DISCUSSION EXAMINES PREVIOUS STUDIES OF CONSISTENCY AND FORMULAS DEVELOPED TO
TEST AND MEASURE BOTH INTER AND INTRACONSISTENCY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
METHODOLOGY USED HERE IN A RESTRICTED STUDY INVOLVING 10 INDEXERS AND 1
ARTICLE, AND RESULTS PRESENTED IN FULL, SHOWING THE NUMBER OF TERMS ASSIGNED
IN RELATION TO LENGTH OF TIME SPENT; CONSISTENCY BETWEEN TERMS; AND FREQUENCY
OF USE OF TERMS. THE CONCLUSIONS INDICATE THE NEED FOR VOCABULARY RESTRICTION
OR PRESCRIPTION OF TERMS TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM OF INDEXER SUBJECTIVITY.
INCREASING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PRECISION.
     
ISOLATES 6 PAIRS OF INTER-RELATED FACTORS (INFORMATION AND USER, DOCUMENT AND
SEARCH DESCRIPTIONS, DESCRIPTOR AND SUBJECT WORD, OBJECT AND PROCESS, HIGHER-
AND LOWER-RANK CONCEPTS, AND SELECTION AND REDUCTION), SOME OF WHICH MAY
INTERFERE WITH SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PRECISION
(ESPECIALLY IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS). TO ELIMINATE SUCH INTERFERENCE, PROPOSES
THAT' A FORMULA SPECIFYING INFORMATION NEED MORE PRECISELY SHOULD BE
INTRODUCED; WHILE INDEXING, SUBJECT (RATHER THAN DOCUMENT) CONTENT SHOULD BE
DESCRIBED; CONCEPT CHARACTERISTICS, RATHER THAN UNIFIED KEY WORDS, SHOULD BE
USED; PROCESS-ORIENTED WORDS SHOULD BE USED TO DESCRIBE CHANGES IN TIME;
HIGHER-RANK CONCEPTS SHOULD BE USED ONLY IF THEY ADEQUATELY COVER ALL
SUBORDINATED CONCEPTS; AND ELEMENTS FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SHOULD NOT BE
MIXED WITH THOSE AIMED AT CONTENT DESCRIPTION.
THEORY OF CONCEPTS.
     
TRANSLATION OF A PAPER DELIVERED AT A 1975 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY
SCIENCE AND DOCUMENTATION ANALYSING THE FUNCTION OF CONCEPTS IN NATURAL
LANGUAGE WITH REFERENCE TO THE FORMULATION OF NEW CONCEPTS NECESSITATED BY THE
GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE. THE DISCUSSION COVERS THE RELATION BETWEEN NATURAL AND
ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGES; THE CONSTRUCTION OF CONCEPTS BY SYNTHESISING THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECTS THEY REPRESENT; THE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS
EXISTING BETWEEN CONCEPTS SHARING COMMON CHARACTERISTICS; INTENSION AND
EXTENSION OF CONCEPTS; THE CATEGORISATION OF CONCEPTS AND SYSTEMS CONSTRUCTION
BY COORDINATION; AND FINALLY PROCEDURES FOR DEFINING CONCEPTS SO AS TO PROMOTE
UTILISATION OF NEW TERMS.
THEORIES AND MODELS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PUBLISHED IN 2J. DOCUM1., 33 (2) JUNE 77 FOR AN
ABSTRACT OF WHICH 2SEE1 78/533.
REGISTERED INFORMATION' HOW TO RETRIEVE A DOCUMENT.
     
AN ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENTATION SEARCH PROCESS, PARALLELLING THE PROFESSIONAL
APPROACH TO THAT OF EVERYDAY LIFE. THE SUCCESSIVE STAGES INVOLVED ARE
DISCUSSED IN SEQUENCE, FROM THE INITIAL ENQUIRY; THROUGH TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE
THE SEARCH FIELD BY INCREASING PRECISION AND FOR MATCHING THE AVAILABLE
DOCUMENTATION TO THE INITIAL ENQUIRY; TO THE FINAL TASK OF ACCESSING THE
DOCUMENT SELECTED. A CHECK LIST SUMMARISING THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS FOR
REGISTERING DOCUMENTS ON ACQUISITION TO FACILITATE SEARCHING IS APPENDED.
BUCHANAN, LOCKE AND WITTGENSTEIN ON CLASSIFICATION.
     
BUCHANAN'S ACCOUNT OF CLASSIFICATION (2THEORY OF LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION,
1BINGLEY, 1969) CLAIMS THAT (1) CLASS MEMBERS NECESSARILY SHARE SOMETHING IN
COMMON AND (2) CLASSIFICATION IS A MENTAL ACTIVITY. TRACES BOTH CLAIMS TO
LOCKE AND MAINTAINS THAT THEY ARE CONTENTIOUS. DISCUSSES WITTGENSTEIN'S
ALTERNATIVE THEORY.
A SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION FOR GENERAL LINGUISTICS.
     
THE CLASSIFICATION DESCRIBED IS A SHORTENED VERSION OF A CLASSIFICATION USED
FOR A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS AND ORIGINALLY DEVISED FOR
THE SYSTEMATIC DOCUMENTATION OF ESSAYS AND DEPENDENT WORKS AT THE INSTITUTE OF
GENERAL LINGUISTICS IN MUNSTER. SINCE THE ESSAYS ARE ON HIGHLY SPECIALISED
SUBJECTS, A CLASSIFICATION OF GREAT DEPTH WAS NEEDED WHICH, BECAUSE OF COSTS
AND ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS, HAD TO BE OPERABLE MANUALLY. MANUAL PROCEDURES
ALSO REDUCE THE RISK OF FAULTY INDEXING. THE CLASSIFICATION IS STRICTLY
HIERARCHIC SINCE IT MUST BE CAPABLE OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL EXPANSION
WITHOUT RISK OF STRUCTURAL ALTERATION. WORK ON THE SCHEME BEGAN IN 1978; THE
21 MAIN CLASSES ARE LISTED WITH THEIR SUBORDINATE SECTIONS.
A STUDY OF TITLES OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN
THE DECADES AFTER KWIC' 1960 AND 1970.
     
REPORT OF A BRAZILIAN STUDY BASED ON WORK PREPARED FOR A POSTGRADUATE COURSE
IN INFORMATION SCIENCE, DESIGNED TO SHOW WHETHER TITLES HAVE BECOME MORE
INFORMATIVE IN RESPONSE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF KWIC INDEXING PROCEDURES. 400
TITLES PUBLISHED IN 1956, 1966, AND 1976 IN 4 PROMINENT ENGLISH LANGUAGE
INFORMATION SCIENCE JOURNALS WERE ANALYSED AND THE RESULTS COMPARED. A
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFORMATION CONTENT OF TITLES WAS ESTABLISHED.

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGIES WITH THE AIM OF THEIR COORDINATED
DEVELOPMENT.
     
ANALYSES THE SPECIFICS AND RESULTS OF THE LEXICAL PROCESSING OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL TEXTS FOR THE COMPILATION OF THESAURI FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
ACTIVITIES AND FOR THE UNIFICATION OF TERMINOLOGY. IDENTIFIES METHODS FOR
REPRESENTING THE MEANINGS OF TERMS IN THESAURI AND TERMINOLOGICAL SYSTEMS.
PROPOSES PROCEDURES FOR THE CORRELATION OF THESAURI CONSTRUCTION AND
MAINTENANCE WITH TERMINOLOGICAL WORK, AND THE SIMULTANEOUS SOLUTION OF THE
PROBLEMS OF THE 2 DISCIPLINES.
TERMINOLOGY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: THE TERM 'COGNITIVE PROCESSES' IN THE
THESAURI OF TWO DISCIPLINE-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO). HIERARCHICAL CHARTS
SHOWING THE ARRAYS UNDER THE TERM 'COGNITIVE PROCESSES' IN THE ERIC THESAURUS
AND THESAURUS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INDEX TERMS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TERM APPEARS
IN DIFFERENT HIERARCHIES IN THE 2 INDEXING LANGUAGES. 3 EXPLANATIONS ARE
OFFERED, DISCUSSED, AND REJECTED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THE NEED FOR FURTHER
SIMILAR STUDIES.

WARNER-LAMBERT/PARKE-DAVIS-CAS REGISTRY III INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) REGISTRY III RECORDS OF CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE ARE USED TO AUGMENT THE WARNER-LAMBERT/PARKE-DAVIS (WL/PD) COMPUTER
FILES OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA. ENTRY OF DATA AT WL/PD IS PARALLELED BY
ENTRY OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AND NAMES AT CAS, WHICH THEN SENDS THE
COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDS TO WL/PD. WL/PD USES INQUIRE SOFTWARE WHICH PROVIDES
INTERACTIVE OR BATCH MULTIFILE SEARCH CAPABILITIES AND ROUTINE REPORT
GENERATION. BATCH PROCESSING IS USED FOR SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCHING AND
HIGH-QUALITY PRINTING OF STRUCTURES AND NAMES.
AN INTEGRATED CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR DRUG
DEVELOPMENT.
     
THE DIVISION OF EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS AT THE WALTER REED ARMY INSTITUTE OF
RESEARCH (BETHESDA, MARYLAND), IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVISION OF BIOMETRICS,
HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATED CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DATA
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE US ARMY MEDICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
COMMAND'S DRUG DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE SYSTEM, KNOWN AS THE CHEMICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, COMPRISES 4 SUBSYSTEMS' BIOLOGY, INVENTORY,
CHEMISTRY, AND REPORT GENERATOR. DESCRIBES FILE ORGANISATION, RETRIEVAL
CRITERIA, SEARCH PROCEDURES, SEARCH STRATEGIES, AND SEARCH APPLICATIONS OF
EACH SUBSYSTEM.
THE PRODBIB DATA BASE' RETRIEVAL OF PRODUCT INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLISHED
LITERATURE.
     
BURROUGHS WELLCOME CO. (RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA) HAS DEVELOPED
A COMPUTERISED DATA BASE, PRODBIB, TO STORE AND RETRIEVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION, SUBJECT INDEXING TERMS, AND DATA EXTRACTED FROM PUBLISHED PAPERS
ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, USING INFODATA SYSTEMS INC.'S INQUIRE SOFTWARE
IN BATCH MODE. DESCRIBES FILE ORGANISATION; EXPLAINS INDEXING POLICY (ONLY
INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT IS INDEXED, NOT THE WHOLE
PUBLICATION); AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF TYPICAL SEARCHES.
AN ALGORITHM FOR SUFFIX STRIPPING.

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. AN ALGORITHM FOR SUFFIX STRIPPING IS DESCRIBED, WHICH
HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AS A SHORT, FAST PROGRAM IN BCPL. IT EFFECTIVELY WORKS BY
TREATING COMPLEX SUFFIXES AS COMPOUNDS MADE UP OF SIMPLE SUFFIXES, AND
REMOVING THE SIMPLE SUFFIXES IN A NUMBER OF STEPS. IN EACH STEP THE REMOVAL OF
THE SUFFIX IS MADE TO DEPEND UPON THE FORM OF THE REMAINING STEM, WHICH
USUALLY INVOLVES A MEASURE OF ITS SYLLABLE LENGTH.
AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR CONDUCTING CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SEARCHES.
     
DESCRIBES THE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SEARCH CAPABILITIES OF THE ROHM AND HAAS

THE SYNERGISM OF USER NEEDS, SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS.
     
USER PERCEPTION OF DATA IMPORTANCE AND THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF HARDWARE
AND STORAGE DEVICES WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS. A
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S FUNCTIONS ARE ULTIMATELY DICTATED BY DATA BASE DESIGN.
EARLY ON-LINE SYSTEMS WERE DESIGNED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION LIMITED TO
CITATIONS ONLY USING SEQUENTIAL FILES. NOW FULL TEXT INFORMATION, NUMERIC
INFORMATION, AND MANIPULATIVE SYSTEMS ARE BEING PERCEIVED BY A CLASS OF USERS
NOT INTERESTED IN SPECIALISED VOCABULARY SKILLS. THESE USERS ARE PLACING
DEMANDS THAT WILL REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY, IMPROVED AND
EXPANDED STORAGE CAPABILITY, MORE SOPHISTICATED FILE STRUCTURE, AND
TRANSPARENT DATA MANIPULATIVE DEVICES. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THESE DEMANDS
WILL BRING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW GENERATION OF MULTITIERED DATA BASES
THAT ALLOW USERS AT ALL SKILL LEVELS TO APPROACH THEM. THE POINT IS THAT, AS
THE USER'S NEED FOR TYPES OF DATA TO BE RETRIEVED CHANGES, SO MUST THE DATA
BASE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
TRANSLATING AND ONLINE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,
20 NOV 80. INFORMATION CAN BE RETRIEVED BY DIRECT INTERROGATION BY A REMOTE
COMPUTER BY MEANS OF A KEYBOARD TERMINAL AND A TELEPHONE. THE ADVANTAGES OF
SUCH AN ON-LINE SYSTEM ARE FAST ACCESS TO LARGE QUANTITIES OF DATA AND THE
OPPORTUNITY TO REFINE THE ENQUIRY BY CONVERSING WITH THE COMPUTER. AT PRESENT,
DATA BASES CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF A TRANSLATION OF A DOCUMENT, OR AN
ALTERNATIVE, ALREADY EXISTS. THEY CAN ASSIST WITH TRANSLATING PARTICULAR WORDS
OR PHRASES, ESPECIALLY IN NEW SUBJECT AREAS. IN THE FUTURE, ON-LINE SYSTEMS
MAY BE EXPLOITED TO PRODUCE MORE SOPHISTICATED AIDS, REFLECTING THE STRUCTURE
OF LANGUAGE.
ONLINE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS DATA BASE SEARCHING AND THE USE OF MICROFICHE
DOCUMENTS ONLINE BY ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS.
     
REPORTS FINDINGS RELATED TO ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS' USE OF
ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING AND MICROFICHE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS ON-LINE.
OVERALL, THE DATA SUGGEST THAT DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS ARE INVOLVED IN LITTLE
ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT DATA BASES, HAVE LIMITED
ACCESS TO ON-LINE TERMINALS, HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE TRAINING IN THE USE OF DATA
BASES, AND ACQUIRE VIRTUALLY NO MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS
ON-LINE. THESE AND OTHER FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED, FACTORS THAT ENCOURAGE AND
LIMIT THE USE OF ON-LINE SERVICES IN A DEPOSITORY LIBRARY ARE PRESENTED, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE TO INCREASE DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS' USE OF GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENT DATA BASES AND ACCESS TO MICROFICHE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS ON-LINE.
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA-AN INTEGRATED ON-LINE APPROACH.
     
THE ICI PHARMACEUTICALS DIVISION HAS REPLACED ITS SEPARATE CHEMICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL DATA BASES WITH AN INTEGRATED ON-LINE SYSTEM FOR CHEMICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL DATA REGISTRATION AND RETRIEVAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. THE DATA
BASE AT PRESENT HOLDS 190,000 CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FROM 5 ICI DIVISIONS, DATA ON
267 BIOLOGICAL TESTS, AND OVER 1 MILLION BIOLOGICAL TEST RESULTS FROM THE
PHARMACEUTICALS DIVISION. A BURROUGHS 6700 COMPUTER IS USED, LINKED TO 3
TERMINAL COMPUTERS AND 8 VISUAL DISPLAY UNITS. DATA INPUT AND RETRIEVAL IS
DESCRIBED WITH EXAMPLES.
CHEMLINE' A CHEMICAL STRUCTURE SEARCH KEY TO BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION.
     
THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE'S ON-LINE CHEMICAL DICTIONARY FILE
(CHEMLINE) IS PRIMARILY USED TO ENHANCE THE RETRIEVAL OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES. DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF
CHEMLINE AS A MECHANISM TO LINK CHEMICAL STRUCTURES TO BIOLOGICAL DATA. SEARCH
TECHNIQUES ARE DEVELOPED TO INTEGRATE CLASSES OF STRUCTURALLY-RELATED CHEMICAL
WITH TOXICITY DATA AND INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ON-LINE RETRIEVAL FILES SUCH
AS THE REGISTRY OF TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES (RTECS) AND TOXLINE.
FEES FOR ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH SERVICES IN PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED LIBRARIES.
     
ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING IS AN IMPORTANT RECENT INNOVATION IN LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE CHOICES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE MADE IN ADOPTING THIS SERVICE HAVE
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE LIBRARY SERVICES. THEIR DECISIONS ABOUT
WHETHER, WHEN, AND HOW TO CHARGE THE USER REVEAL THEIR JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE
APPROPRIATE ROLE OF USER FEES. THE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES HAVE INTEGRATED
ON-LINE SEARCHING INTO MORE TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY-BASED INNOVATIONS. A CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION SURVEY
OF PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED LIBRARIES FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OFFERING SEARCHES, NEARLY
HALF AT NO CHARGE TO THE USERS; AND THAT USER FEES DIFFERED ACCORDING TO WHERE
THE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED AND WHETHER THE USER OR THE LIBRARIAN WAS SEEN AS ITS
PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES APPEARED TO HAVE 2
DIFFERENT SERVICE PATTERNS.
USA FORECASTS.
     
PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF 2 INTERNATIONAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, INC. REPORTS ON

CONFERENCE DISCUSSING FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR THE PRESS IN RELATION TO THE
CHALLENGE OF OTHER MEDIA. SURVEYS THE HISTORY OF THE PRESS IN GENERAL SINCE
THE INVENTION OF PRINTING, AND SHOWS THAT TODAY THE PUBLIC PREFERS PRESS
REPORTAGE OF IMPORTANT EVENTS TO RADIO AND TELEVISION COVERAGE. SINCE THE WAR,
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PRESS AS WELL
AS PROMOTING RIVAL MEDIA. DESPITE SOCIAL CHANGES AND IMPROVED LIVING
STANDARDS, RADIO AND TELEVISION HAVE NOT REPLACED THE PRESS, BUT RATHER
SUPPLEMENT IT. THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL RADIO AND NATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORKS
REMAIN TO BE SEEN, BUT UNLIKE RADIO AND TELEVISION, THE PRESS IS NOT STATE
CONTROLLED. THE PUBLIC HAS ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE PRESS FOR COMMENT AND NEWS IN
EVENTFUL TIMES, AND WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO DO SO.

CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE EUROPEAN COMECON COUNTRIES.
     
OUTLINES THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE CURRENT
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. PROCEEDS WITH A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE HISTORY AND
FUNCTION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF THE COMECON COUNTRIES. NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE FINANCED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND COMPILED BY BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
CENTRES ATTACHED TO NATIONAL LIBRARIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE 1960S INCREASED THE COORDINATING FUNCTION OF THE
CENTRES. CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF MONOGRAPH PUBLICATIONS ARE
SUPPLEMENTED BY BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF PERIODICALS AND SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES BY
SUBJECT, FORM, PUBLISHER ETC. ENDS WITH THE STATE OF THE ART IN COORDINATION
AND COOPERATION AMONG THE COMECON COUNTRIES.
GENERAL AND SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CATALOGUES COLLECT, DESCRIBE AND ARRANGE A COMPLEXITY OF DATA
FOR COMMUNICATION TO SCHOLARS BY PRECISE CRITERIA, THUS CONSTITUTING THE
THEORY AND METHODOLOGY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE. AUTOMATION HAS BROUGHT
MORE COMPLEX PROBLEMS TO GENERAL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN ITALY, CONSEQUENT
UPON INSUFFICIENT CENTRAL CONTROL AND DIFFICULTIES IN COLLECTING AND
DISSEMINATING INFORMATION. GENERAL AND SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE
COMPLEMENTARY TO THE HISTORY OF BOOKS AND LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY ECONOMY.

A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PURCHASE AND READING OF BOOKS.
     
STATISTICS ON THE PUBLICATION AND SALE OF BOOKS IN HUNGARY REVEAL A LARGE
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL PUBLISHED SINCE 1970, MOSTLY PRODUCED BY
THE 19 OFFICIAL PUBLISHERS. BOOK PRICES ARE RELATIVELY LOW; ON AVERAGE EACH
INDIVIDUAL BUYS 10 BOOKS PER YEAR. LIBRARY PURCHASES HAVE DOUBLED DURING THE
LAST 10 YEARS, OWING TO IMPROVEMENTS IN SCHOOLING AND THE QUICK RISE OF THE
GENERAL CULTURAL LEVEL. IN THE LAST 14 YEARS THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES OWNING
BOOKS HAS DOUBLED AND THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES OWNING MORE THAN 300 BOOKS HAS
TREBLED. THE AMOUNT OF READING DONE HAS NOT INCREASED AT AN EQUAL RATE BECAUSE
OF TELEVISION. MORE NON-FICTION IS PUBLISHED AND PURCHASED THAN FICTION,
REFLECTING A GENERAL TENDENCY WORLDWIDE.
AN ALTERNATIVE ISBN CHECKING ALGORITHM.
     
THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBER IS WELL KNOWN AS A TITLE IDENTIFIER IN
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, AS A CONTROL NUMBER FOR ISBN ASSIGNED
MONOGRAPHS APPEARING ON THE UK MARC RECORD, AND AS A STOCK-ITEM IDENTIFIER IN
THE BOOK TRADE. EQUALLY WELL-KNOWN IS THE HELPFUL CHARACTERISTIC THAT ISBNS
EXHIBIT WHEREBY THEIR 10TH AND FINAL CHARACTER SERVES AS A CHECK-DIGIT,
MINIMISING DATA ENTRY ERRORS. OTHER WELL-KNOWN IDENTIFIERS, SUCH AS THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NUMBER AND THE BRITISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY NUMBER WHICH
SERVE RESPECTIVELY AS CONTROL NUMBERS ON THE LC MARC RECORD AND ON THE UK MARC
RECORD FOR NON-ISBN ASSIGNED MONOGRAPHS, DO NOT EXHIBIT COMPARABLE
SELF-VALIDATING CHARACTERISTICS.
THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER (ISSN) AND ITS USE BY THE UNITED
STATES POSTAL SERVICE.
     
DESCRIBES THE RATIONALE AND PROCEDURES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MANDATORY
PRINTING OF THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER (ISSN) ON SERIALS MAILED
AT SPECIAL RATES IN THE USA. THE EFFORTS OF THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
NATIONAL SERIALS DATA PROGRAM (NSDP) TO ASSIGN AND HAVE THE ISSN PRINTED ON
EACH SERIAL PUBLICATION HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REINFORCED THROUGH THIS
REQUIRED USE. CITES BIBLIOGRAPHIC, COMMERCIAL AND MANAGERIAL BENEFITS FOR THE
INFORMATION COMMUNITY.
COPYRIGHT AND THE NEW MEDIA.
     
DISCUSSES THE PRINCIPLES FOR THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OF COPYRIGHT WHICH ARE
EMBODIED IN THE REVISION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON PROPOSED CHANGES IN THAT PART
OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT WHICH REFERS TO PRIVATE COPYING. THE MAJORITY WISH TO SEE
FREE COPYING IN SINGLE COPIES FOR PRIVATE USE, BUT TO RESTRICT PROFESSIONAL
MULTIPLE COPYING. THIS RESTRICTION IS PARTICULARLY AIMED AT THE NEW MEDIA'
SOUND AND VIDEOTAPES, WHICH HAVE LED TO MASS USE. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO ECONOMIC PROFIT FROM THEIR
WORKS AND THE RIGHT OF SOCIETY TO FREE ENJOYMENT OF CULTURAL VALUES. UPHOLDS
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE OWNER'S SOLE RIGHT, BUT POINTS TO WAYS OF SOLVING
COPYRIGHT CONFLICTS IN A MASS USE SITUATION VIA LICENCE AGREEMENTS. TODAY,
WHERE TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE COLLECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF WORKS OF ART POSSIBLE IT
IS NATURAL TO SEEK THESE AGREEMENTS WITH ORGANISATIONS RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL
ARTISTS. RECOMMENDS THAT SUCH LICENCE AGREEMENTS BE CONCL UDED, AND THAT
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ORGANISE THEMSELVES SO AS TO EASE THE ADMINISTRATION OF
AGREEMENTS.
CONTINUING EVOLUTION OF ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING.

OF TECHNICAL DIGESTS.
     
PROJECT DESIGNED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF A DIRECTORY OF SOURCES OF TECHNICAL
DIGESTS (I.E. STATE OF THE ART REVIEWS) AND THE EFFORT AND COST REQUIRED TO
COMPILE IT, AS WELL AS ATTITUDES OF EXPERTS IN APPROPRIATE FIELDS TOWARDS IT.
RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE NO MAJOR OBSTACLES TO PRODUCING SUCH A PUBLICATION
BUT CASTS DOUBTS ON WHETHER IT WOULD ATTRACT SUFFICIENT DEMAND TO JUSTIFY THE
COSTS INVOLVED.
ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRENDS IN GERMAN BASIC SCIENCE JOURNALS' A POTENTIAL
COLLECTION TOOL.
     
AMERICANS TRADITIONALLY AVOID READING ARTICLES IN SCIENCE JOURNALS PUBLISHED
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES. BY WAY OF RESPONSE THE PUBLISHERS OF SOME OF THESE
JOURNALS HAVE PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED THE PROPORTION OF ARTICLES IN ENGLISH.
THAT TREND IS STUDIED HERE FOR GERMAN BASIC SCIENCE JOURNALS. TRENDS TABLES
SUCH AS THE 1 REPORTED (FOR 18 YEARS OF 35 JOURNALS) CAN SERVE LIBRARIANS IN
THEIR FUTURE DECISIONS ABOUT STORAGE AND PURCHASE.
THE FUTURE OF THE BOOK' A HISTORIAN'S PERSPECTIVE.
     
EXAMINES THE FUTURE OF THE BOOK IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY USING A HISTORICAL
APPROACH. ITS THESIS IS THAT THERE WILL BE BOTH CONTINUITY WITH THE PAST AND
BREAKS WITH TRADITION, AND THAT BOTH FORCES WILL IMPACT THE FUTURE LIBRARY. IT
DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN CUMULATIVE AND NONCUMULATIVE KNOWLEDGE AND BASIC AND
APPLIED RESEARCH AND CONCLUDES THAT KNOWLEDGE IN CERTAIN DISCIPLINES IS BEST
COMMUNICATED USING THE TRADITIONAL PRINT-ON-PAPER FORMAT, WHILE COMMUNICATION
OF KNOWLEDGE IN OTHER DISCIPLINES IS LIKELY TO INCORPORATE THE NEWER
TECHNOLOGIES.

SOFTWARE PREPARATION' HIGH VOLUME FOR LIBRARIES, MEDIUM VOLUME FOR ACADEMIC
USE AND LOW VOLUME FOR SPECIAL INFORMATION MATERIALS FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS.
MATERIALS FOR OPTICAL STORAGE' A STATE-OF-THE-ART SURVEY.
     
THE IDEAL SPECIFICATIONS OF RECORDING MATERIAL FOR OPTICAL DATA STORAGE
SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO COST, AVAILABILITY AND
TOXICITY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO VARIOUS TYPES OF MATERIALS KNOWN TO BE
UNDER DEVELOPMENT' THIN METAL FILMS, ORGANIC DYES, METAL-IMPREGNATED POLYMERS,
PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM, ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS, PHOTOCHROMICS AND
MAGNETO-OPTICS.
SELECTING, INSTALLING AND DESIGNING A COM SYSTEM.
     
EXAMINES THE DESIGNING OF A COM SYSTEM FROM 2 PARTICULAR STANDPOINTS; START-UP
COSTS AND START-UP VOLUME. THE INFLUENCE OF THESE 2 FACTORS ON COST
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE SYSTEM IS ISOLATED.
PROFESSIONALISM UNDER ATTACK.
     
PROFESSIONS ARE DEFINED AS A WAY OF ORGANISING WORK. THE ATTACK ON PROFESSIONS
IS SET WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF WORLD INTERDEPENDENCE AND CONFLICT BETWEEN
CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM. PROFESSIONS ARE A CAPITALISTIC FORM OF ORGANISING
WORK. SOURCES OF ATTACK DESCRIBED ARE RADICALISM, EGALITARIANISM, CONSUMERISM,
AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. ONE SOURCE OF POWER TO COUNTERACT ATTACK IS THE
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION.
AUTOMATION OF TEST-DATA TRANSMISSION FROM PRODUCER TO COMPUTER MASTER FILE.
     
DESCRIBES 2 METHODS FOR THE DIRECT INPUT OF DATA OBTAINED DURING SCIENTIFIC
EXPERIMENTS INTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL, ALL FURTHER DATA MANIPULATION AND
PROCESSING BEING CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER PROGRAMS' (1) DIRECT RECORDING OF
OBSERVATIONS (E.G. PLANT GROWTH) ON A PORTABLE BATTERY-POWERED RECORDING
DEVICE, FOLLOWED BY DATA TRANSMISSION TO THE COMPUTER AND (2) CRT ENTRY OF
OBSERVED VALUES FOR TEST AND CONTROL ANIMALS FOR SPECIFIC TESTS. ONLY AFTER
VERIFICATION OF DATA ACCURACY BY THE INFORMATION PRODUCER ARE THE RESULTS
ENTERED INTO THE MASTER DATA BASE. IN THE EXPERIMENTS DESCRIBED, THE ABBOTT
AUTOMATED BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA SYSTEM (ABCD) WAS USED.
LIBRARY SCIENCE AND HISTORY' A DIALECTICAL APPROACH.
     
CRITICISES CONVENTIONAL STUDIES OF LIBRARY HISTORY FOR FAILING TO APPRECIATE
THAT LIBRARIES ARE ESSENTIALLY PART OF AN INTERLOCKING COMPLEX OF INSTITUTIONS
FORMING A PARTICULAR SOCIAL STRUCTURE, WHICH ITSELF IS DETERMINED BY THE
HISTORICAL PROCESS. SHOWS HOW DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM CAN BE USED TO DEAL WITH
SOCIAL ENTITIES AS PART OF A TOTALITY OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FACTORS, AND
EMPHASISES THE NECESSITY OF VIEWING HISTORY AS A PROCESS AND NOT AS FINITE.
ONCE THIS IS UNDERSTOOD, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO PLACE THE STUDY OF LIBRARIES
ON A RECOGNISABLE SCIENTIFIC BASIS, AS A COMPLEX OF PRACTICES WHICH ARE
ULTIMATELY SOCIALLY DETERMINED.
THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR THE STUDY OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN
CAPITALIST COUNTRIES (RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIALS, 1974-1979).
     
REVIEWS RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIALS DEALING WITH THE STUDY OF WESTERN

WITH A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS DIVIDING 380 SOURCES ACCORDING TO YEARS OF
PUBLICATION AND TITLES OF PERIODICALS, THEN NUMBER OF ARTICLES DEVOTED TO
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. SUBJECT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE ORGANISATION OF
LIBRARIANSHIP REPRESENTED THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE (25%), FOLLOWED BY
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION (15%), WORK WITH READERS (13%), LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY
(10%), THEORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP (6-7%). THE LOWEST NUMBER WAS DEVOTED TO THE
WORK WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE (3%) AND THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP
(2%). REFERENCES TO ARTICLES ARE GIVEN WITHIN EACH SUBJECT GROUP.

DOCUMENT: 'LIBRARY ORGANISATION IN ERETZ-YISRAEL' (IN HEBREW).
     
FISHMAN STUDIED LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE USA IMMEDIATELY AFTER WORLD WAR I AND IT
IS THEN THAT HE WROTE THIS ARTICLE, ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN HAPOEL HATZAIR.
LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN ERETZ-YISRAEL ARE UNPLANNED AND NOT SYSTEMATIC, BECAUSE
THEY ARE BASED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON GIFTS, RATHER THAN PURCHASES. LIBRARIANS
MUST NOT OBLIGATE THEMSELVES TO CATALOGUE GIFT COLLECTIONS IN TOTO, BUT MUST
LEAVE THEMSELVES FREE TO CHOOSE ONLY WHAT IS NEEDED AND TO GIVE AWAY OR
EXCHANGE THE REST. HE CALLS FOR THE FOUNDATION OF A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE
IN JERUSALEM WITH FAR-REACHING CENTRALISED POWERS TO TRANSFER BOOKS FROM 1
LIBRARY TO OTHERS WHERE THEY WILL BE MORE USEFUL.
LIBRARIES IN THE PHILIPPINES.
     
AFTER A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES IN THE
PHILIPPINES EXAMINES IN GREATER DEPTH THE CURRENT SITUATION. THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY (FOUNDED 1900), ITS FUNCTION, ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE, POLICIES AND
THE WORK OF ITS DEPARTMENTS ARE DESCRIBED. PUBLIC LIBRARIES BEGAN TO GROW AT
THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY; A COORDINATED PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK WAS
ESTABLISHED IN 1949. THE LARGEST UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS THAT OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF THE PHILIPPINES (FOUNDED 1908). ITS RICH COLLECTIONS ARE THE BASIS FOR
RETROSPECTIVE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES COMPILED BY THE LIBRARY. THE WORK OF
SPECIAL AND GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES IS ALSO NOTED, FOLLOWED BY THE PROVISION OF
LIBRARY EDUCATION AND THE ROLE OF THE 2 LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS IN PHILIPPINE
LIBRARIANSHIP.
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANSHIP IN CANADA.
     
PRESENTS A PICTURE OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. THE SUB-SECTIONS ARE
GEOGRAPHIC AND TOPICAL BUT ALL EMPHASISE THE CURRENT SITUATION. THE SPARSE
POPULATION, THE VASTNESS OF THE COUNTRY, THE POLITICAL ORGANISATION, THE
MULTICULTURAL AND MULTILINGUAL NATURE OF THE INHABITANTS HAVE ALL INFLUENCED
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANSHIP IN CANADA. UP TO RECENTLY THE LIBRARY SITUATION
WAS BUOYANT BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESENT AND THE NEAR FUTURE ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS WILL SLOW THE PROCESS AND WILL FORCE A REASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF
LIBRARIES IN CANADIAN SOCIETY.

INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND LIBRARY COOPERATION ARE SEEN AS THE MAIN
ACHIEVEMENTS. LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT, PERSONNEL (WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE STATUS OF WOMEN), EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT SITUATION, THE ROLE
OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS IN US LIBRARIANSHIP, AND LIBRARY CONFERENCES AND THEIR
ORGANISATION ARE DISCUSSED.

JOURNALS READ BY ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, 1973 AND 1978.
     
A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF PROFESSIONAL
JOURNAL READING BEING DONE BY ACRL (ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCH
LIBRARIES) ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, WITH DATA DRAWN FROM 2 SEPARATE SURVEYS MADE
OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO A SAMPLE OF ACRL
MEMBERS IN 1973 AND AGAIN IN 1978, WHICH ASCERTAINED HOW MANY JOURNALS THEY
WERE READING REGULARLY AND WHAT THE TITLES OF THOSE JOURNALS WERE.
ILLUSTRATIONS PROVIDE A COMPARISON OF MOST FREQUENTLY READ TITLES FOR 1973 TO
1978, WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF READER RESPONSE FOR EACH TITLE. FOR BOTH YEARS
SURVEYED, ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 7 JOURNALS READ ON A
REGULAR BASIS. A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 DATA INDICATED THAT 7 OF THE
TITLES CITED AS BEING READ ACCOUNTED FOR 80% OF THE JOURNAL READING. AS HAD
BEEN THE CASE IN 1973, MORE THAN 9 IN 10 OF THESE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WERE
REGULAR READERS OF COLLEGE & RESEARCH LIBRAR IES. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OTHER
TITLES HEAVILY CITED IN 1973 LOST READERSHIP AMONG ACRL MEMBERS DUE TO THE
DRAMATIC APPEARANCE OF THE JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP.
QUESTIONS OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARY PRESS.

INTERVIEWS JOHN P. WILKINSON, LEADER OF THE CENTRE FOR RESEARCH IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, TORONTO, WHO DESCRIBES HIS CAREER IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRE IN 1975. THE CENTRE IS SUPPORTED FINANCIALLY BY
FUNDED RESEARCH ONLY, BUT IS HELPED ALSO BY ITS PROXIMITY TO CANADA'S LARGEST
RESEARCH LIBRARY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. FOR A RESEARCH PROJECT IN
LIBRARIANSHIP TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THE PROBLEM MUST BE OF CURRENT INTEREST SO
THAT IT CAN ATTRACT FUNDS, IT MUST BE AN AREA IN WHICH ONE SPECIALISES, AND
HELP MUST BE SOUGHT FROM OTHER EXPERTS. EXPLAINS WHAT A RESEARCH PROBLEM IS
AND HOW IT IS FORMULATED IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE RESEARCH PROCESS. DISCUSSES THE
RESEARCH INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERSONALITY TRAITS AND EFFECTIVE
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT, AND ARGUES THAT RESEARCHERS SHOULD RESOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH
HINDER DECISION-MAKING, BUT THEY SHOULD NOT MAKE THE DECISIONS THEMSELVES.
RESEARCH METHODS IS A COMPULSORY SUBJECT IN THE UNIVERSITY'S MLS PROGRAMME,
STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH IF LIBRARIANSHIP IS TO BECOME A
PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINE.

IN CONVERSATION WITH INA VINTGES.
     
TEXT OF A DISCUSSION WITH W.M.E. VINTGES WHO RETIRED FROM HER POST AS HEAD OF
LIBRARY AFFAIRS AT THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LECTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) IN NOV 81. UNTIL 1962 MRS VINTGES HAD
BEEN HEAD OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARY AT TILBURG, A POST WHICH
INVOLVED HER IN SERVING ON A NUMBER OF NATIONAL COMMITTEES. IN 1962 MRS.
VINTGES WAS APPOINTED GENERAL CONSULTANT WITH THE CENTRALE VERENIGING VOOR
OPENBARE BIBLIOTHEKEN (CENTRAL ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES) AND JOINED
THE STAFF OF THE NBLC IN 1972. MRS VINTGES FEELS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS TOO RESTRICTED AND THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A BASIC
SERVICE FOR EDUCATION AND SOCIAL WELFARE SHOULD NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS
PURELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

THE LIBRARIAN, INFORMATICS, AND THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN PROFESSIONALS
WORKING IN LIBRARIES TODAY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 14TH BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON INFORMATICS AND LIBRARY
SCIENCE, SAO PAULO, 16-23 OCT 81. THE LIBRARY OF TODAY IS DESCRIBED WITH
REFERENCE TO RECENT ORGANISATIONAL AND TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS, WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF ITS LONG HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT. TO FULFIL ITS RESPONSIBILITIES OF
COLLECTING, PROCESSING AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION IN THE 1980S, THE LIBRARY
HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON INFORMATION ANALYSIS; THE AVAILABILITY OF
NEW TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY HAS FREED PROFESSIONALS FROM MANY TRADITIONAL
TASKS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING HAS ALTERED GREATLY IN SCOPE AND ORIENTATION.
COMPARES AND CONTRASTS THE ROLES OF THE LIBRARIAN AND THE INFORMATION
SCIENTIST IN A SOCIETY LIKE BRAZIL UNDERGOING RAPID DEVELOPMENT, POINTING OUT
THE POTENTIAL DANGER IN LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM WHEN COMPLEMENTING
COOPERATION IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NEEDS.
INTERVIEW WITH PROFESSOR GASTON LITTON.

ARCHIVES, WHO HAS COLLABORATED ON SEVERAL LIBRARY TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN
BRAZIL, ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON THE STATE OF THE PROFESSION. TOPICS COVERED
INCLUDE THE PROSPECTS LIBRARY SCIENCE OFFERS AS A CAREER, PROBABLE
DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE NEXT 25 YEARS, NEGLECTED AND OVERDEVELOPED FIELDS, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR LIBRARIANS IN NON-LIBRARY SITUATIONS, AND CURRENT TRENDS IN
RESEARCH AND TRAINING.
A CASE ABOUT LIBRARIES: BRIEF OF 'AMICUS CURIAE'.
     
DETAILS THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LONG ISLAND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION COALITION
AGAINST THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OF ISLAND TREES, NEW YORK. THE CASE ARISES FROM
THE ACTION OF ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE BOARD IN ORDERING THE REMOVAL OF 9 BOOKS
FROM THE SHELVES OF THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY, ONE BOOK FROM THE JUNIOR
HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY AND ONE FROM THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM.
THE OCCUPATIONAL IMAGE: POOR FOCUSING?.
     
DISCUSSES THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF THE PUBLIC AND SELF IMAGE OF LIBRARIANS
AND INFORMATION OFFICERS. USES QUESTIONNAIRE MATERIAL SUPPLIED BY UK
LIBRARY-INFORMATION WORKERS TO DESCRIBE HOW THESE PROFESSIONALS SEE
THEMSELVES, AND TO CONSTRUCT AN IDEAL IMAGE OF EACH PROFESSION. CONSIDERS THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF 2 OF THE STUDY'S FINDINGS' (1) THAT A RELATIVELY HIGH
PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE PROFESSION WANT TO GET OUT; AND (2) THAT
COMPARED WITH THE PROPORTION OF SUCH GROUPS IN OTHER PROFESSIONS, LIBRARIANS
AND INFORMATION WORKERS SEEMED TO DISPLAY A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF AMBIVERT
MOTIVATION, WHICH INDICATES A BALANCED AND ROUNDED MOTIVATION AND TYPE OF
PERSONALITY. ALSO CONCLUDES THAT THE PUBLIC IMAGE OF THE LIBRARIAN IS IN THE
PROCESS OF CHANGE.
MEANINGS OF THE INFORMATION NOTION-A DEBATABLE AND TOPICAL PROBLEM.
     
ANALYSES THE CONCEPT OF 'INFORMATION' AND THE MEANINGS WHICH THE TERM HAS
ACQUIRED. AFTER A DISCUSSION OF THE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF INFORMATION,
SUGGESTS THAT THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT SHOULD BE A SYNTHETIC AND POSITIVE
EXPRESSION-AN ESSENTIAL ENTITY WHICH IS GENERATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
SEMIOTIC SITUATION, IS ESTABLISHED IN THE FIELD OF SIGNS AND/OR SIGNALS AND
BECOMES THE SUBSTANCE AND ESSENCE OF ANY COMMUNICATION.
INFORMATION, THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE.
     
DEBATES CONCERNING THE CONCEPT OF 'INFORMATION' EMPHASISE SEVERAL IMPORTANT
ASPECTS OF THE THOUGHT/SPEECH RELATIONSHIP, PLEADING FOR THE REFRESHMENT OF
SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE. ANALYSES CONTRADICTORY OPINIONS REGARDING THE
ORTHOLOGICAL STATUS AND THE MEANING OF THE TERM 'INFORMATION', AND INDICATES
CERTAIN DELIMITATIONS, UNDERLINING THE INTRICATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
INFORMATION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE, AND BETWEEN INFORMATION AND THOUGHT. ARGUES
AGAINST THE USE OF THE TERM INFORMATION IN THE MATHEMATICAL SENSE, CONSIDERING
IT TERMINOLOGICALLY CONFUSING.
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND PROFESSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
OF AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE BOARD AND COUNCIL MEMBERS, 1876-1917.
     
BY USING THE COMPUTER TO COMPARE SOCIOECONOMIC AND PROFESSIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF ALA EXECUTIVE BOARD AND COUNCIL MEMBERS BETWEEN 1876 AND
1917, IDENTIFIES A COLLECTIVE PROFILE OF BOTH GROUPS IN ORDER TO TEST THE
HYPOTHESIS THAT THE COUNCIL WAS MORE 'DEMOCRATIC' THAN THE EXECUTIVE BOARD.
TEST RESULTS REVEAL CONSIDERABLE HOMOGENEITY THROUGHOUT THE 41-YEAR ANALYSIS
PERIOD, BUT THE PERIOD FROM 1900-1917 DOES DEMONSTRATE SEVERAL HETEROGENEOUS
AREAS WORTHY OF FURTHER STUDY.
THE WORK MARKET.
     
ARGUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMMES THAT WILL
TRULY PREPARE THE PROFESSIONAL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A WORK MARKET DETERMINED,
IN BRAZIL, BY THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS NOW AN
INCREASING DEMAND FOR LIBRARIANS, BUT LIBRARY SCHOOLS DO NOT GEAR THEIR
PROGRAMMES TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR ACTUAL SOCIAL SITUATIONS. ONCE THE NATURE
OF THE MARKET NEEDS IS UNDERSTOOD, TRAINING POLICIES CAN BE ADAPTED
ACCORDINGLY. ILLUSTRATES THE ARGUMENT WITH REFERENCE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FIELDS, EMPHASISING THE NECESSITY FOR PRACTICAL ABILITIES
AND PROFESSIONAL AWARENESS.
LIBRARY EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' PERTINENT ISSUES.
     
EXAMINES THE NEED FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MANPOWER AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARY
SCHOOLS IN THIS CONTEXT. DISCUSSES THE PERTINENT ISSUES WITH REGARD TO (1) THE
LEVELS OF COURSES, (2) THE PLACE OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS, (3) DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING HIGHER EDUCATION IN LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE AND (4) TEACHING STAFF REQUIREMENTS, IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES.

TRAINING IN THE SYSTEM OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES IN
AUSTRIA.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. AFTER A SHORT OUTLINE OF THE PRE-1978 AUSTRIAN LIBRARY
EDUCATION, CONCENTRATES ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW SYSTEM IN OPERATION FROM
1979. TRAINING IN LIBRARIANSHIP, DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS NOT
PROVIDED BY ANY ACADEMIC INSTITUTION IN AUSTRIA AND IS THEREFORE CARRIED OUT
BY LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. LIBRARY EDUCATION IS DIVIDED INTO
CATEGORIES A, B, AND C ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF GENERAL EDUCATION OF
STUDENTS. A-UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, B-SECONDARY SCHOOL CERTIFICATES,
C-UNCERTIFIED SECONDARY SCHOOL LEAVERS. 5 MAIN DISCIPLINES TAUGHT ARE' LAW,
LIBRARY ORGANISATION, HISTORICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS,
PROCESSING, AND THE STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.

 THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. FOR ABSTRACTS 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'.
INTRODUCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE PRESENT CONTENT,
LEVEL AND FRAMEWORK OF HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING IS UNSATISFACTORY'
CURRICULUM UNITS ARE NOT BUILT UPON EACH OTHER; THE SUBJECTS STUDIED ARE NOT
SEPARATED ENOUGH ON EACH LEVEL AND ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COORDINATED; AND THE
COMBINATION OF SUBJECTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEMANDS MADE ON LIBRARIES. THE
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GO ON TO WORK IN LIBRARIES IS NOT KNOWN. THE
AUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED FOR SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING EDUCATION FOR
LIBRARIANSHIP.
CHRONOLOGY OF THE CHANGES IN HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING AND EXTENSION TRAINING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LISTS IN CHRONOLOGICAL
ORDER THE CHANGES IN HUNGARIAN LIBRARY TRAINING SINCE 1947.
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIAN? LIBRARY SCIENTIST? SCIENTIFICALLY TRAINED LIBRARIAN? OR
DEVELOPING TRAINING DEMANDS OF A DEVELOPING PROFESSION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LASZLO MATRAI HAS
SUGGESTED THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
SCIENTIST OF THE SUBJECT FIELD CARED FOR AND SERVED BY HIM, BUT BY NO MEANS A
LIBRARY SCIENTIST. THUS LIBRARY SKILLS SHOULD BE ATTAINED BY PRACTICE. THE
AUTHOR FEELS THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION IN A LIBRARY IS A COMPLEX
OPERATION, REQUIRING TRAINING AT A HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. THIS TRAINING,
INCORPORATING UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE, IS THE ESSENCE OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION
AND IS ESSENTIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS.
LIBRARY CAREER, PROCESS OF CHANGES, DEVELOPMENT TENDENCIES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE ACCELERATED
DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAS RESULTED IN A NEW TYPE OF
LIBRARY USER. THE USER NOW REQUIRES NOT ONLY LIBRARY MATERIAL, BUT ALSO
ANALYSED, EVALUATED INFORMATION. THIS IN TURN HAS GIVEN RISE TO NEW
PROFESSIONAL BRANCHES OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. SUMMARISES THE
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS WHICH FORM AND SHAPE CAREERS IN THIS FIELD.
LIBRARY TRAINING BASED ON INFORMATICS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. INVESTIGATES THE
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TRAINING AND PROPOSES TRAINING
BASED ON INFORMATICS. PRESENTS THE MOST IMPORTANT THEMES OF INFORMATICS AS
SHANNON'S COMMUNICATION THEORY; SCIENTOMETRICS; DOCUMENT TYPOLOGY; ORGANISING
LIBRARY WORK; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY; AND INFORMATION ORGANISATION.
USE OF INFORMATION-SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT-LIBRARY TRAINING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. COMPLETES TIBOR
HORVATH'S CONCEPTION, OUTLINING THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE USER AND
UTILISATION OF INFORMATION. THE THEMES OUTLINED ARE THE ESSENCE OF INFORMATION
USE; THE OBJECTIVE INFORMATION NEEDS OF SOCIETY; THE SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION
DEMAND; THE PROCESS OF INFORMATION USE; GUIDANCE IN INFORMATION USE; AND
SERVING INFORMATION DEMANDS.
SOME QUESTIONS OF LIBRARY TRAINING, RELATION OF UNIVERSITY AND HIGH SCHOOL
TRAINING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. LIBRARY TRAINING SHOULD
BE BASED ON THE PROFESSION AND NOT ON THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES. GENERAL
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SHOULD BE OFFERED RATHER THAN SPECIALIST TRAINING. THE
SUBJECTS COVERED SHOULD BE LINKED WITH EACH OTHER AND THE PROFESSION'S
OBJECTIVES. HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY TRAINING SHOULD BE SEPARATE, BUT
CONNECTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT CROSSING FROM 1 TO THE OTHER IS MADE EASIER.
LIBRARY TRAINING IN YUGOSLAVIA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS OF
LIBRARY TRAINING ON A NATIONAL LEVEL IN YUGOSLAVIA SINCE 1971.
WE DID NOT LEARN FOR THE SCHOOL BUT FOR LIFE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. THE AUTHORS, HOLDERS OF
THE GOMBOCZ SCHOLARSHIP, ATTENDED THE LIBRARY SCIENCE COURSE AT KENT STATE
UNIVERSITY, OHIO. USES EXAMPLES TO DEMONSTRATE THE MORE PRACTICAL NATURE OF
US, AS OPPOSED TO HUNGARIAN, LIBRARY TRAINING.
PREPARING FOR A SURVEY OF ALL THE LIBRARY PROCESSES. ONE LESSON OF AMERICAN
LIBRARY TRAINING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. SUMMARISES THE AUTHOR'S
EXPERIENCES AT THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE, KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, OHIO (SHE
IS A HOLDER OF THE GOMBOCZ SCHOLARSHIP). TO CARRY OUT EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMIC
HIGH-LEVEL LIBRARY WORK, SPECIALISTS MUST BE PREPARED TO MANAGE GENERAL
LIBRARY PROCESSES AS WELL. US LIBRARY SCHOOLS PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO
TEACHING THE ANALYSIS, PLANNING AND ORGANISATION OF SUCH PROCESSES.
NEW TRENDS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDIES.
     
THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE FACULTY OF
PHILOSOPHY WITHIN THE COMENIUS UNIVERSITY IN BRATISLAVA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE
FOR 30 YEARS. AT PRESENT, BOTH FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME UNDERGRADUATE AND
POSTGRADUATE COURSES ARE OFFERED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW IDEAS IN THE
CZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, CURRICULA HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUBJECTED
TO PROFOUND AND SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES. THE DURATION OF UNDERGRADUATE
COURSES HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 5 TO 4 YEARS. IT WILL CONCENTRATE ON
LIBRARIANSHIP AND/OR INFORMATION SCIENCE AS WELL AS ON CLOSELY RELATED
SUBJECTS. THE AIM OF EQUIPPING STUDENTS WITH THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD
OF THEIR PROSPECTIVE TYPE OF LIBRARY HAS BEEN ABANDONED. ALTHOUGH IT FELL
SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, THE EXTENSION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUILDING WILL
NEVERTHELESS ENABLE THE TEACHING AND OTHER STAFF TO BUILD UP RESOURCES OF
AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS,  AND ALSO TO INVOLVE THEIR
STUDENTS IN RESEARCH PROJECTS.
NEW ERA OF THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA.
     
THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA WAS FOUNDED IN 1953, SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN PRAGUE AND BRNO. AFTER OVERCOMING CONSIDERABLE
DIFFICULTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS IN THE 1ST 10 YEARS OF ITS HISTORY, THE SCHOOL
HAS CONCENTRATED IN EDUCATING AND TRAINING PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE LIBRARIANS
AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS. SO FAR ABOUT 3,000 STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR
FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME COURSES. ALMOST 90% OF THEM WORK IN LIBRARIES AND IN
CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION. COMMENCING IN THE
ACADEMIC YEAR 1984-85, NEW SYLLABUSES WILL COME INTO FORCE. THE COURSES
OFFERED WILL BE FULL-TIME ONLY. AFTER 2 YEARS WITH A COMMON CURRICULUM,
STUDENTS WILL TAKE UP EITHER LIBRARIANSHIP OR INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR THE
REMAINING 2 YEARS, WHEN FINAL EXAMINATIONS OF A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL
NATURE WILL BE HELD. THE NEW PROJECT, WORKED OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND  TRAINING IN PRAGUE, WILL
BECOME A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES WITH
CAPABLE STAFF.
INTERVIEW WITH DR. MOLLER.
     
THE NEWLY APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF THE MCGILL LIBRARY SCHOOL ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON
TRAINING IN LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION, PROVISION FOR INSERVICE
TRAINING, AND HIS PLANS FOR DEVELOPING THE MCGILL SCHOOL. A CHRONOLOGY TRACING
THE HISTORY OF LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATION AT MCGILL IS APPENDED.
QUALIFICATION OF LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.
     
HAVING MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES TO SOCIETY, AND ALSO
COURSES OFFERED FOR PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE AND GRADUATE LIBRARIANS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IN SLOVAKIA, DISCUSSES CONTINUING EDUCATION AND
IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STAFF. SINCE 1976, THE
SAID CONCEPT HAS ENJOYED OFFICIAL BACKING BY REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK
MINISTRY OF CULTURE. THE REGULATIONS ARE BINDING ON ALL CENTRAL AND OTHER
MAJOR LIBRARIES. SO FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAINING PROJECTS HAVE BEEN
LAUNCHED BY MATICA SLOVENSKA AND BY THE SLOVAK TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN-SERVICE
COURSES SHOULD NOT ONLY INCLUDE LECTURES, BUT ALSO WORK IN SEMINARS AND
SMALLER GROUPS. VISITS TO SELECTED LIBRARIES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR STAFF
STIMULATE THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND IDEAS. FILMS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE
MATERIALS MUST BE USED MORE FULLY. GRADUATES, CONTINUING THEIR STUDIES ABROAD,
MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO CONCENTRATE ON TOPICAL PROBLE MS, AND TO AIM AT POSTS
WITH RESPONSIBILITY. USERS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE TO BE
EDUCATED AND TRAINED, TOO, TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE.
STARTING WITH UNDERGRADUATES, THE SCHEME MUST BE EXPANDED TO INVOLVE THE WHOLE
NATION IN FUTURE.
CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS THROUGH PRIVATE STUDY.
     
REPORT ON A 2-YEAR-SCHEME INTRODUCED BY THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARY IN RUSE,
TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS IN THE REGION THROUGH PRIVATE
STUDY. INITIALLY, 75 TOPICS WERE OFFERED, AND 94% OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIANS TOOK
PART IN THE SCHEME. EVEN PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS WITH 10, 15 AND MORE YEARS OF
SERVICE WERE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THEORETICAL, CONTROVERSIAL AND/OR INNOVATIVE
THEMES. THEY ALSO WIDELY EXPLORED SOVIET PERIODICALS AND LITERATURE IN
RUSSIAN. THE ATTITUDE AND RESPONSE OF BEGINNERS AND SOME LIBRARY ASSISTANTS
APPEARED TO BE LESS ENTERPRISING AND ENTHUSIASTIC, IN SOME CASES EVEN FORMAL.
IT IS HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ETHICS WILL IMPROVE IN FUTURE.
REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEIR TUTORS, RESULTING IN THE INEVITABLE EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS AND OPINIONS WERE OF BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE IN THE STUDY. A POSITIVE
EVALUATION OF THE SCHEME MUST BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION,
SEARCHING AND STRIVING FOR IMPROVE MENT.
A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT.
     
REPRODUCTION OF THE TEXT OF THE 1917 PROGRAMME FOR THE 1ST COURSE IN LIBRARY
SCIENCE IN BRAZIL, BEGUN AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN 1911, WITH A BRIEF
INTRODUCTION. THE PROGRAMME, COVERING BIBLIOGRAPHY, PALEOGRAPHY, ICONOGRAPHY
AND NUMISMATICS, WAS DROPPED IN 1922.
THE LIBRARIANS' UNION AND FUTURE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
A GROUP OF STUDENTS AT THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL CRITICISES THE LIBRARIANS'
UNION FOR LACK OF POLICY ON EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT
OF A COMMITTEE OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, AND URGES IT TO INITIATE A DEBATE
AMONG THE MEMBERS. THE GROUP PRESENTS ITS OWN SUGGESTIONS' MINOR SUBJECTS
SHOULD BE GATHERED IN LARGER SUBJECT GROUPS; ACCOUNT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN
TEACHING OF THE TREND TO LIBRARIES STAFFED BY A SINGLE LIBRARIAN; THE USE OF
COMPUTERS SHOULD NOT BE A SUBJECT ON ITS OWN, BUT TAUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
ALL SUBJECT AREAS; TEACHING OF RUSSIAN COULD BE CONFINED TO TEACHING OF
TRANSLITERATION UNDER CATALOGUING; THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SHOULD GIVE A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR SEARCHING WITHIN ANY SUBJECT
AREA AND NOT AIM TO GIVE THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULAR SUBJECTS; AND THE
NEW UNIFIED COURSE SHOULD NOT INCLUDE SPECIALISATION, BUT EMPHASISE THE COMMON
ASPECTS OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARI ANSHIP.
EDUCATION FOR AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS' A VIEW FROM THE TRENCHES.
     
REVIEWS THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ARCHIVES IN THE USA AND FACTORS
INFLUENCING THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION OF ARCHIVISTS, PARTICULARLY AT THE
GRADUATE LEVEL.
PALAEOGRAPHY IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE.
     
TEXT OF A PAPER DELIVERED AT A SYMPOSIUM IN THE CUBAN NATIONAL LIBRARY IN
1978. THE COLLECTION UNTIL RECENTLY CONTAINED VERY LITTLE MANUSCRIPT MATERIAL
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, AND NO STAFF WERE TRAINED IN SPANISH PALAEOGRAPHY. IN
1945 A GENERAL ARCHIVE TRAINING COURSE, WHICH INCLUDED PALAEOGRAPHY, WAS HELD,
USING PHOTOCOPIES OF ORIGINALS. SINCE 1959, MANY LONG-STANDING PROJECTS HAVE
BEEN REALISED, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION OF LARGE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS
DATING FROM THE 16TH CENTURY, CONTAINING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS FOR THE STUDY OF
CUBA'S HISTORY. ACCORDINGLY, SINCE 1962, NEW TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN SPANISH
PALAEOGRAPHY HAVE BEEN INITIATED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NEW MATERIAL STILL
BEING ADDED TO THE ARCHIVE.
ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES, 1937 TO PRESENT.
     
FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEEN
PRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,
THE 2 MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS ARE
DRAWN. BETWEEN 1937-40 AND 1967-70, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAME
PERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCE
THE EARLY 1970S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSES
SINCE THE EARLY 1960S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICAN
LITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OF
ARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967-70 TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVAL
MANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND
SOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM
INDEPENDENTLY. PRACTICING ARCHIVISTS OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN
TEACHER POOL AND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE LITERATURE UNTIL REGULAR FACULTY IN
LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND HISTORY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED, BUT 1ST
A BASIC REORIENTATION MUST OCCUR THAT RECOGNISES THAT RECORDS AND PAPERS OF
CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY ARE THE CENTRAL PROBLEM.
TEACHING ABOUT COMPUTERS AND LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN SCHOOLS OF LIBRARIANSHIP
AND INFORMATION SCIENCE' A COMPARATIVE SURVEY.
     
BEGINNING WITH A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF 24 PUBLISHED SURVEYS AND PROGRAMMES OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE CURRICULA FROM 1969-75, DISCUSSES THE
PROFESSIONAL CONTINUITY IN CHANGING COURSES. A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS
MAINTAINING THE IDENTITY OF 'CORE STUDIES' IN PROFESSIONAL CURRICULA. THE
CONTENT AND OBJECTIVES OF COMPUTER COURSES ARE LISTED AND DISCUSSED. THE
COVERAGE OF THE AUTHOR'S OWN SURVEY IS EXPLAINED. ALL 17 SCHOOLS IN THE UK, 1
IN DUBLIN AND 13 IN EASTERN USA AND CANADA WERE VISITED IN 1978 INVOLVING
INTERVIEWS WITH OVER 130 PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY OR IN GROUPS. 10 SCHOOLS OVERSEAS
PROVIDED FURTHER DATA IN QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY BEGIN BY
SUMMARISING THE VARIOUS STATED OBJECTIVES FOR COMPUTER COURSES. THERE FOLLOWS
A REVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE OF SUCH COURSES AND THE VIEWS ON OPTIONS IN THIS
SUBJECT. OUTLINING THE TITLES, CONTENT, DURATION AND STAF FING, REVIEWS, WITH
SUPPORTING TABLES, COURSES FOR COMPUTER APPRECIATION, PROGRAMMING AND LIBRARY
AUTOMATION. SEPARATE TABLES AND COMMENTARY COVER THE DATA FROM THE
QUESTIONNAIRES. IN THE CONCLUSIONS, IT IS EMPHASISED THAT COMPUTING IS NOW AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, THOUGH HOW MUCH AND FOR WHOM IS NOT
YET DECIDED. ADVANCED COURSES WILL SOON BE NEEDED FOR THOSE WISHING TO
SPECIALISE.
COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, WITH
CURRICULUM SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO
NIGERIA.
     
DATA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME A VITALLY IMPORTANT SUBJECT TO
LIBRARIES, AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION HANDLING TECHNIQUES HAVE
BROUGHT ABOUT CHANGES IN CONVENTIONAL LIBRARY OPERATIONS. LIBRARY SCHOOLS HAVE
ADDED COURSES ON COMPUTERS, TO GIVE STUDENTS A KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTERS AND
ALLIED HARDWARE AND THEIR LIBRARY APPLICATIONS. STUDIES THE CURRENT PROVISION
OF SUCH COURSES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UK AND USA, AND EXAMINES THE ADVISABILITY
AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TEACHING OF COMPUTER COURSES IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, CURRICULUM SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR LIBRARY
SCHOOLS IN DEVELOPING NATIONS.
THE RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION IN THE HUMANITIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES'
PROBLEMS AS AIDS TO LEARNING.
     
DESIGNED TO ASSIST STUDENTS IN LEARNING TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION IN THE
HUMANITIES/SOCIAL SCIENCES AND TO AID LIBRARY SCIENCE TEACHERS IN DEVISING
REFERENCE QUESTIONS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THE BOOK CONSISTS OF OVER 4000
QUESTIONS ARRANGED IN 13 BROAD SUBJECT AREAS. AN ANSWER KEY TO ALL THE
QUESTIONS IS PUBLISHED SEPARATELY.
THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE, PATENTS AND LAW
AT ILMENAU TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY.
     
THE ORGANISATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS AT THE INSTITUTE SINCE 1955 ARE
DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. COURSES WERE ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE
INFORMATION ON RELEVANT MEDIA FOR ENGINEERS BUT IN 1968 A POSTGRADUATE
CORRESPONDENCE COURSE ON INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION WAS BEGUN FOR GRADUATES
IN SCIENCE OR TECHNOLOGY WITH SOME WORK EXPERIENCE IN INFORMATION SERVICES. IN
1981 A COURSE COMMENCED ON SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS
OF ELECTROTECHNOLOGY; SEVERAL SHORT COURSES AND SEMINARS ARE ALSO PROVIDED.
MANY FOREIGN STUDENTS ATTEND INSTITUTE COURSES, WHICH HAVE AROUSED WORLDWIDE
INTEREST. THE INSTITUTE WORKS CLOSELY WITH OTHER LIBRARIES AND INSTITUTES AT
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE PATENT COLLECTION IS PARTICULARLY
VALUABLE FOR WORK WITH INDUSTRY.
CONSERVATION AND COLLECTION MANAGEMENT' EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
     
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL CONSERVATION HAS SUFFERED FROM A LACK OF PROFESSIONAL
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE USA. ITS EMPHASIS ON APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING
CANNOT ENGENDER A CAPACITY FOR RESEARCH, BUT THE 4 GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE
USA AND CANADA STRESS ART CONSERVATION WITH ITS ATTENDANT FOCUS ON ARTIFACT
RESTORATION, RATHER THAN COLLECTION CONSERVATION IN ARCHIVES AND LIBRARIES.
ALTHOUGH THE NATIONAL CONSERVATION ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE,
A.L.A.-ACCREDITED LIBRARY SCHOOLS PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND
POSITIVELY. RECENT EFFORTS ARE DISCUSSED, ESPECIALLY THE CURRICULA AT COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND.
SURVEY OF EDUCATION NEEDS OF PRACTICE-ORIENTED LIBRARIES.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY, CARRIED OUT FOR THE CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
LAW LIBRARIES, COMMITTEE ON CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION FOR LAW LIBRARIANSHIP,
TO DETERMINE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION NEEDS OF LAW FIRM AND COURT HOUSE
LIBRARIANS.
THE DELIVERY OF CONTINUING EDUCATION' TELECONFERENCING, AN ALTERNATIVE MODE.
     
AN EXPERIMENTAL OFFERING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CONTINUING
EDUCATION COURSE CE 46, LIBRARY MANAGEMENT/BUDGETING WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO 16
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIANS VIA THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-EDUCATION TELEPHONE
NETWORK. FEATURES OF THE HARDWARE OF THE TELECONFERENCE NETWORK, A FEW
APPLICATIONS RELATING TO MEDICINE AND LIBRARY SCIENCE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE
CONSIDERATIONS ARE EXAMINED. DESCRIBES HOW THE EXPERIMENTAL COURSE WAS
CONDUCTED, COURSE PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN, PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED, AND EVALUATION
DATA OBTAINED FROM PARTICIPANTS. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TELECONFERENCING
MODE OF DELIVERY AND THE TRADITIONAL FACE-TO-FACE FORMAT IS STRESSED.
RECOMMENDATIONS CALL FOR CONTINUED CONSIDERATION OF TELECONFERENCING AS A
METHOD OF DELIVERING CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSES AND SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY
OF MLA PROVIDING ITS OWN TELECONFERENCING NETWORK.
ACTIVITIES OF STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION OF PROFESSIONAL
PUBLIC LIBRARIANS.
     
(PHD DISSERTATION-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) ANALYSES THE ACTIVITIES OF STATE
LIBRARY AGENCIES IN THE SOUTHEAST USA TO DETERMINE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN
PLANNING AND OFFERING CONTINUING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFESSIONAL
PUBLIC LIBRARIANS.
THE SELECTION AND PREPARATION OF TEACHER-LIBRARIANS.
     
(PHD THESIS-MONASH UNIVERSITY). A STUDY FOLLOWING A GROUP OF AUSTRALIAN
TEACHERS WHO WERE SELECTED FOR SPECIALISED MID-SERVICE TRAINING IN
TEACHER-LIBRARIANSHIP, TO DETERMINE THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AT ENTRY, ANY
ATTITUDE CHANGES DURING TRAINING AND THE 1ST 6 MONTHS BACK IN SCHOOLS, AND ANY
RELATIONSHIPS OF SUCH CHANGES TO THE ENTRY CHARACTERISTICS.
LESSING'S LIBRARY POST IN WOLFENBUTTEL. PART I.

GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM LESSING WAS LIBRARIAN AT THE COURT OF BRUNSWICK AND LUNEBERG
IN THE 1770S. SOME OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT WRITINGS WERE PRODUCED DURING THIS
PERIOD BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT THAT THE POST WAS A SINECURE HELD TO
ENABLE HIM TO WRITE. THERE IS PROOF IN HIS OWN WORKS THAT HE TOOK
LIBRARIANSHIP SERIOUSLY. THE OPINIONS OF VARIOUS CONTEMPORARY AND MODERN
WRITERS ON LESSING'S LIBRARY WORK ARE ANALYSED. MANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
THOUGHT HIM DISORGANISED BUT HIS CATALOGUE OF NEW LIBRARY STOCKS, AMOUNTING TO
ABOUT 100,000 VOLUMES, REMAINED UNFINISHED BECAUSE OF STAFF SHORTAGES AND
ULTIMATELY BECAUSE OF HIS OWN DEATH. SOME PEOPLE REGARD HIM AS THE THEORETICAL
FOUNDER OF MODERN LENDING LIBRARIES.
IN MEMORIAM. PAUL POINDRON (1912-1980).

HOMAGE DELIVERED AT A MEETING OF THE FRENCH LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION BY A
PERSONAL FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE OF POINDRON, WHO FOR 45 YEARS ACTIVELY ADVANCED
THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN FRANCE AND CREATED IMPORTANT CONTACTS
THROUGH HIS WORK ON INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HIS CAREER
IN THE DIRECTORATE OF LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC READING, IN RELATION TO HIS
PROMOTION OF REGIONAL LIBRARY INTERESTS. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES HIS OWN TRAINING
UNDER POINDRON, AND EMPHASISES HIS PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL QUALITIES.
GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE. PROJECTS FOR 1982.

17 PROJECTS ARE LISTED WHICH WERE BEGUN IN 1981 AND WILL BE CONTINUED IN 1982.
NEW PROJECTS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED AND INCLUDE
INTERLIBRARY LOANS OF SHEET MUSIC, STANDARD LIST OF KEYWORDS FOR SUBJECT
CATALOGUES, STUDY COURSES FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS, STANDARD FUNCTIONAL
DESCRIPTION FOR MIDDLE-TIER LIBRARIES, A DOCUMENTARY FILM ENTITLED 'LIBRARY
SERVICES TO THE SICK', AN EXHIBITION ABOUT MOBILE LIBRARIES AND AN
INVESTIGATION OF PRECIS (PRESERVED CONTEXT INDEXING SYSTEM).
ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM IN AMERICAN LIBRARIES.

THE PLACE OF THE INTELLECTUAL IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IS EXAMINED IN THE
LIGHT OF ANTI-INTELLECTUALIST PREJUDICE WHICH EXISTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION IN
THE USA.
SOME CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL SITUATION OF LIBRARY SCIENCE.

A POSTGRADUATE PAPER PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL, BRAZIL, EXAMINING THE
VALIDITY OF THE SCIENTIFIC STATUS CLAIMED FOR LIBRARIANSHIP. THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS CLARIFIED, AND RECENT THEORETICAL STUDIES ON
LIBRARY SCIENCE ADDUCED AS EVIDENCE THAT ALTHOUGH IN THEORY LIBRARIANSHIP IS
SCIENTIFIC IN CHARACTER, IN PRACTICE IT IS RATHER A TECHNOLOGY. IN CONCLUSION
THE NON-SCIENTIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF LIBRARIANSHIP ARE ANALYSED AND A
PROGRAMME PRESENTED FOR ACHIEVING A PROPER SCIENTIFIC BASIS.
THE 1980'S' SOME THOUGHTS ON DEVELOPMENTS IN PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION.

TEXT OF THE CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, NORTHERN IRELAND BRANCH, JAN 81. DISCUSSES THE CHANGES SOON TO
TAKE PLACE IN THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF UK LIBRARIANS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE
IMPORTANCE, TO THOSE ALREADY QUALIFIED, OF THE CONTINUING REFINEMENT AND
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS. SURVEYS BRIEFLY THE FACILITIES FOR
CONTINUING EDUCATION AVAILABLE TO IRISH LIBRARIANS, AND SUGGESTS SOME OTHER
POSSIBILITIES, INCLUDING' SABBATICAL LEAVE; SECONDMENT TO LIBRARY SCHOOLS; AND
CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN PRACTISING LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SCHOOLS.
REPORT OF THE FOURTH CONGRESS OF COORDINATORS OF POSTGRADUATE COURSES IN
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.

THE CONGRESS, HELD IN NOV 80, WAS ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF BRAZIL'S 5
LIBRARY SCHOOLS. PAPERS WERE PRESENTED ON LIBRARY SCIENCE RESEARCH; SPECIALIST
TRAINING; SELECTION OF DISSERTATION TOPICS; AND MAXIMISATION OF STUDENT
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THE TEXTS ARE GIVEN IN FULL, WITH SUMMARY OF THE MAIN
DISCUSSION POINTS. REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE OTHER SCHEDULED ACTIVITIES'
PRESENTATIONS OF COURSE PLANS, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNMENT FINANCE
AGENCIES. THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH COMMENT ON THE STATE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE
EDUCATION PROGRAMMES IN BRAZIL.
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION AS A PROFESSION.

TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONGRESS OF THE IAALD IN MANILA IN 1980,
GIVING A GENERAL VIEW OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD IN RELATION TO LIBRARIANSHIP IN GENERAL AND IN OTHER FIELDS. A
PRELIMINARY DEFINITION SETS OUT THE NATURE OF THE WORK OF THE AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARIAN, AND THEN THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIELD ARE DISCUSSED IN
DETAIL' ITS INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE, THE WIDE RANGE OF TYPES OF
DOCUMENTATION, ITS INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER, AND THE NEED TO DISSEMINATE
INFORMATION TO A DIVERSE COMMUNITY REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF EDUCATIONAL
BACKGROUNDS. THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING SERVICES ARE EXAMINED
WITH REFERENCE TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES, WHERE THE
EXTENT TO WHICH NETWORK OPPORTUNITIES ARE USED DEPENDS ON THE SCALE AND FOCUS
OF SERVICES OFFERED, AND THIS IN TURN INFLUENCES PROFESSIONAL DUTIES. THE
EDUCATION AND SKILLS ESSENTIAL FOR THE P ROFESSIONAL ARE ANALYSED IN RELATION
TO THE CHANGES IN INFORMATION AND LIBRARY SERVICES IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SOCIAL
AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR ALTERATIONS IN
LIBRARY SCHOOL CURRICULA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAMMES OF CONTINUING
EDUCATION FOR PRACTISING LIBRARIANS. FINALLY POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS TO MEET
THE DEMANDS OF THE FUTURE ARE CONSIDERED.
LIBRARIANSHIP, PROFESSIONALISM & SOCIAL CHANGE.T

HE LIKELY EFFECTS OF THE EMERGENCE OF A POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY ON THE FUTURE
OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT LITERATURE.
LIBRARIES AND CENSORSHIP.

TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCIENCE
CONFERENCE DESCRIBING THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE USA, WHERE ALTHOUGH STATE
CENSORSHIP OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IS MINIMAL, THE SUBJECT IS 1 OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO PRACTISING LIBRARIANS AND IN LIBRARY SCHOOLS. THE ACTIVITIES OF
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN ESTABLISHING LIBRARY AND READER RIGHTS TO
FREEDOM FROM INTERVENTION ARE DESCRIBED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE 1948
LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE MCCARTHY PERIOD. IN CONCLUSION, REFERENCE IS
MADE TO THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL, WHERE THE OFFICIAL CENSORSHIP HAS CHANGED,
AND BRAZILIAN LIBRARIANS WARNED TO GUARD AGAINST ANY ENCROACHMENTS ON LIBRARY
FREEDOM.
THE NECESSITY FOR A RESEARCH ETHIC.

CONSIDERS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LIBRARIAN AS CUSTODIAN OF INFORMATION.
REFERS TO THE US AND CANADIAN CODES OF PRACTICE, AND REVIEWS THE SITUATION IN
FRANCE, IN RELATION TO THE NECESSITY FOR ESTABLISHING AN INTERNATIONAL ETHIC.
A PROFESSIONAL CHARTER SHOULD COVER THE FOLLOWING TOPICS' FREE CIRCULATION OF
KNOWLEDGE AND CENSORSHIP; THE LIBRARIAN'S RESPONSIBILITIES, HIS RIGHT TO MAKE
MISTAKES, AND THE NOTION OF SERVICE; THE ETHICAL AND HUMAN IMPLICATIONS OF
INFORMATION TECHNIQUES; AND TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS OF THE FUTURE. EACH POINT
IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED, AND THE DIGNITY OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A PROFESSION

1976-DECEMBER, 1981 (CITATIONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE FOR
THE PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING COMMUNITIES DATA BASE).

THIS BIBLIOGRAPHY CITES REPORTS ON THE DERIVATION AND APPLICATIONS OF HILBERT
TRANSFORMATIONS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION THEORY. A FEW REPORTS REFER
TO APPLICATIONS TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS AND INDUSTRIAL ULTRASONIC DETECTION FOR
MATERIAL TESTING.
THE WRITTEN WORD AND THE DOCUMENT' CONTRADICTORY AND COMPLEMENTARY DIALECTICS.

TRANSLATION FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. USING A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK DERIVED
FROM RECENT FRENCH RESEARCH IN BIBLIOLOGY AND DOCUMENTOLOGY, THE DIALECTICS OF
THE WRITTEN WORD AND THE DOCUMENT ARE ANALYSED SEQUENTIALLY, BY COMPARING AND
CONTRASTING THE PROPERTIES OF EACH IN RELATION TO THEIR ESSENTIAL
CHARACTERISTICS; HOW THEY FUNCTION WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNICATION
CIRCUITS; MARXIST SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY; AND THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. FROM
THIS STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE 2 ENTITIES A SCIENTIFIC SYNTHESIS IS EFFECTED
DELIMITING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIBLIOLOGY AND DOCUMENTOLOGY, AND THE
APPLICATIONS OF THIS THEORY IN THE TEACHING FIELD EXAMINED. THE ANALYTICAL
MODEL EMPLOYED, AND ITS METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION, IS ADVANCED AS A WORKING
HYPOTHESIS FOR FURTHER CRITICISM, RESEARCH, AND MODIFICATION.
THE COOKED AND THE RAW.

THE NOTION OF DATA AND INFORMATION BEING DIFFERENT IN KIND IS BASED ON THE
THESIS THAT THERE EXISTS RAW FACTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE DATA THAT FORM THE
BASIS FOR INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY, KNOWLEDGE. PRESENTS A NUMBER OF
ARGUMENTS TO SHOW THE FLAWS IN THIS, FOUNDATIONALIST, THEORY. PRESENTS

ALA PERSPECTIVES FOR 1981-1982.

DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH THE ALA COULD EXPAND ITS SERVICES TO ENABLE MORE OF
ITS MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN ITS ACTIVITIES. SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE' ORGANISING
POSTER SESSIONS AND SLIDE PRESENTATIONS AT MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES; ENLARGING
THE MEMBERSHIP OF COMMITTEES; THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONTINUING EDUCATION
CENTRE AND INFORMATION CENTRE; THE EVALUATION OF ALL SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES;
AND THE DRAWING UP OF EMPLOYMENT GUIDELINES. ALSO NOTES THE WORK BEING DONE BY
THE ALA AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED, AND THE EFFORTS IT
IS MAKING TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE SERVICES OFFERED BY LIBRARIES.
ALA IN SAN FRANCISCO' COUNCILOR'S REPORT.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL SESSION AT THE ALA ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO,
1981, PRESENTING A PERSONAL VIEW OF COUNCIL'S 'OPERATING AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALA
AND DIVISIONS', CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION. NEW BY-LAWS WHICH SET STUDENT DUES
IN DIVISIONS AT $5.00 AND AUTHORISE DIVISIONS TO SET UP NATIONAL CONFERENCES
GENERATED STRONG SUPPORT. THIS LATTER DECISION REFLECTS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
JOINING DIVISIONS AND ROUND TABLES OF PERIPHERAL INTEREST, AND ITS
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE NATIONAL OR REGIONAL CONFERENCES WILL HURT STATE
CONFERENCES IN TERMS OF ATTENDANCE AND EXHIBITORS.
E PLURIBUS UNUM-OR NOT?.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE LAST
YEAR THERE HAS BEEN MUCH CONCERN OVER 'TROUBLE' AT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION HQ. ALA DIVISIONS SEEK GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THE CONDUCT OF
THEIR OWN FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL AFFAIRS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE
THEIR OWN DUES STRUCTURES AND POLICIES, THE RIGHT TO LARGER ALLOCATIONS FROM
ALA'S GENERAL FUND, AND THE RIGHT TO MORE PARTICIPATION IN THE SELECTION OF
THE PERSON HIRED TO REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS AT ALA HQ. A PROPOSED 'OPERATING
AGREEMENT FOR ALA AND ITS DIVISIONS' ADDRESSES MANY OF THESE CONCERNS, AND IS
THE PRODUCT OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ALA HQ STAFF AND DIVISIONAL OFFICERS.
ALA' CLA TIES THAT BIND, BUT DON'T CHAFE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, JUNE 81. EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, AND PLACES
IT IN ITS HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. NOTES THE UNPARALLELED GROWTH OF AMERICAN
AND CANADIAN LIBRARIES IN THE 1960S, AND IDENTIFIES THE CHALLENGES WHICH THEY
FACE IN THE 1980S. LIBRARIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SEEN AS HAVING TO DEAL WITH
THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY INCREASED COSTS FOR LABOUR AND LIBRARY MATERIALS,
COUPLED WITH AN ALL OVER DECLINE IN FUNDING, AND COMPETITION FROM NEW
INFORMATION AGENCIES, FROM SUPERMARKETS AND OTHER OUTLETS FOR COMMERCIAL
READING, AND FROM VIEWING AND LISTENING MATERIALS. DISCUSSES THE LINK BETWEEN
US AND CANADIAN LIBRARY EDUCATION, AND INDICATES THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR A
CHANGE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.
THE ALA/ACRL RELATIONSHIP.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. DISCUSSES THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND REFERENCE LIBRARIES (LATER, ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCH
LIBRARIES). ACRL CAME INTO EXISTENCE AS A RESPONSE TO THE SEPARATE NEEDS OF
ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. THE ALA/ACRL RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN ROCKY OVER THE
YEARS-SOME SEE IT AS AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP, OTHERS AS A PARENT/ADOLESCENT CHILD
RELATIONSHIP. A 1981 SUMMIT MEETING IN CHICAGO SUGGESTED SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL
CHANGES IN THE ALA AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THESE SUGGESTIONS ARE INVESTIGATED IN
SOME DETAIL.
SUBJECT LIBRARIES IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC'S LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS
EXEMPLIFIED BY TECHNICAL LIBRARIES.

THE ASSOCIATIONS' SECTIONS ARE COMPOSED OF SPECIALISED SUBJECT AND ACADEMIC
GENERAL LIBRARIES WITH RELEVANT STOCKS IN THE SUBJECT AREA CONCERNED. THEY AIM
TO DEVELOP COOPERATION, THE OPTIMAL USE OF LITERATURE, EDUCATION AND EXCHANGE
OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES. THE TECHNICAL SECTION IS THE LARGEST, WITH 318
MEMBERS. TECHNICAL LIBRARIES STOCK MAINLY MODERN MATERIAL; THEIR STAFF MEMBERS
ARE FEW, THEIR OPENING HOURS ARE RESTRICTED AND THEIR RESEARCH RESULTS ARE
OFTEN INACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THEY ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH A
SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOURCES WHICH PLAY
SUBORDINATE ROLES IN OTHER LIBRARIES. THE TECHNICAL LIBRARY SECTION IS
CURRENTLY CONCERNED WITH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION WORK IN FACTORY COMBINES,
PROBLEMS OF PATENT LITERATURE AND LIBRARY WORK IN TECHNICAL COLLEGES WITHIN
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXES.
CLA/CEMA COOPERATION' MACRO/MICRO PERSPECTIVES AND POSSIBILITIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. GENERAL
ASSOCIATIONS WITH BROAD INTERESTS ARE LOSING MEMBERSHIP AS SPECIALIST
ASSOCIATIONS GROW, AND IF THE ENTIRETY IS TO HOLD TOGETHER, THERE MUST BE A
STRONG INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN THE CONSTITUENT PARTS. THE COLORADO LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION AND COLORADO EDUCATIONAL MEDIA ASSOCIATION HAVE HAD PAST
DISAGREEMENTS, BUT SHARE MANY COMMON INTERESTS. SUGGESTS 13 AREAS IN WHICH
THEY COULD COOPERATE AND TABULATES DATA ON THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THEIR
PRESENT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES.
REPORT ON THE 32ND MEETING OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS' UNION AT

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DIPLOMA LIBRARIANS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
1980-1981.

THE YEAR'S MOST IMPORTANT EVENT WAS THE LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE IN WUPPERTAL,
MAY 80, ON INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION, WORK PLACES FOR USERS AND STAFF AND NEW
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. THERE IS AS YET NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOCIAL POSITION OF
LIBRARIANS, WAGE NEGOTIATIONS HAVING COME TO A TEMPORARY HALT. ANALYSIS OF
QUESTIONNAIRES ON STAFFING IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE
GERMAN LIBRARY CONFERENCE WILL CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF COOPERATION BETWEEN
THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE) AND THE VARIOUS
LIBRARIANSHIP ORGANISATIONS. LIBRARIANS MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE
BOOKTRADE TO DISCUSS CHANGES IN COPYRIGHT LAW, THE WORK OF THE DEUTSCHE
BIBLIOTHEK (GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY), ODIN AND THE PUBLICATION OF AGREEMENTS
BETWEEN LIBRARIANS AND BOOKSELLERS. MINUTES OF THE MEMBERS' MEETING IN
REGENSBURG, JUNE 81, ARE INCLUDED.
WEST VIRGINIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETING.

THE MEETING WAS HELD ON 12 JUNE 81 AT CHARLESTON. A REPORT WAS MADE ON
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REVISION OF THE WEST VIRGINIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BY-LAWS,
AND DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE TREASURER'S REPORT, OF MEMBERSHIP AND COMMITTEES,

DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY EDUCATION IN JORDAN.

(MA THESIS). THE LIBRARY EDUCATION MOVEMENT IN JORDAN WAS STUDIED AND
EVALUATED. EXAMINED THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY EDUCATION
IN JORDAN, WHAT TYPES AND SIZE OF PERSONNEL NEEDED BY THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SYSTEM AND HOW BEST THE EXISTING LIBRARY EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN
RESPOND TO EXPRESSED NEEDS.
LIBRARY EDUCATION IN CANADA.

OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP IN CANADA
FROM THE LATE 1920S. CANADA HAS TENDED TO FOLLOW THE US PATTERN AND ALL
CANADIAN LIBRARY SCHOOLS STILL SUBMIT THEIR PROGRAMMES TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION FOR ACCREDITATION. HOWEVER ANYONE CAN CALL HIMSELF A 'PROFESSIONAL
LIBRARIAN' AND LIBRARIES DO NOT HAVE TO HIRE GRADUATES FROM ACCREDITED
SCHOOLS. MOST PROGRAMMES RUN FOR 2 YEARS FOR A MASTER'S DEGREE, THE 1ST YEAR
FULL TIME AND THE 2ND PART TIME. SCHOOLS HAVE RECENTLY ORIENTED THEIR
PROGRAMMES AWAY FROM TRAINING IN ROUTINE TECHNIQUES AND TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR
PLANNING, ADMINISTRATION, THE SETTING OF STANDARDS, ORGANISING POLITICAL
ACTIVITY FOR LIBRARY SUPPORT, DEPLOYMENT OF HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES,
FUND-RAISING AND NEW METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND SUBJECT ANALYSIS.

COMMENTS ON A REPORT OF THE WORKING PARTY ON THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL ISSUED
BY THE GOVERNMENT'S DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION. THE REPORT EXAMINES
PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL ACT. THE PROPOSALS CONCERN A
COMMON BASIC TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS, THE NEED FOR POST-GRADUATE TRAINING AND
THE ORGANISATION AND CONTENT OF COURSES. FUTURE DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF
LIBRARIANS ARE ESTIMATED. IT IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH A SECTION FOR THE BASIC
EDUCATION AND ANOTHER FOR THE OTHER COURSES. AN EDUCATION COUNCIL, APPOINTED
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, WITH REPRESENTATIVES FOR ALL INTERESTED
ORGANISATIONS IS SUGGESTED. RESEARCH IS GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY, ESPECIALLY THAT
LEADING TO DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL LIBRARY SUBJECTS. THE REPORT
RECOGNISES THE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION, BUT EXPECTS
THIS TO TAKE PLACE THROUGH CHANGE IN THE PRIORITIES OF THE SCHOOL'S
EXPENDITURE ON PRESENT TASKS AND SEES ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS
POLITICALLY UNREALISTIC.
LIBRARY EDUCATION AT AHMADU BELLO UNIVERSITY, ZARIA.

REVIEW OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AT AHMADU BELLO
UNIVERSITY, ZARIA, WITH COMMENTS ON THE LIKELY FUTURE OF LIBRARY EDUCATION IN
NIGERIA. THE FUTURE IS SEEN AS VERY BRIGHT, AS THE NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL
ESTABLISHMENT GROWS. AT PRESENT NIGERIA HAS 4 LIBRARY SCHOOLS, BUT THIS NUMBER
COULD GROW TO 12 BY THE YEAR 2000 TO MEET MORE ADEQUATELY THE LIBRARY MANPOWER
NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY.
CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE 80S' THOUGHTS OF A SERVICE LIBRARIAN.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. NEW ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP-CHANGES IN CATALOGUING RULES, IN USE OF NEW
FORMS OF THE CATALOGUE, THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW REFERENCE SOURCES, ON-LINE
SEARCHING IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES AND OTHER INNOVATIONS-WILL MAKE USE OF
UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE LIBRARIES BY PATRONS MORE DIFFICULT IN THE FUTURE. THE
CRUCIAL PROBLEM FOR SERVICE LIBRARIANS IS KEEPING UP WITH THESE ASPECTS
THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO INSTRUCT, INFORM AND ASSIST THE USER. SHARING OF
KNOWLEDGE IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS TO KEEP UP WITH
NEW DEVELOPMENTS; SHARING THROUGH PUBLICATIONS, CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS,
AUDIO-VISUAL PROGRAMMES AND IN-HOUSE TRAINING SESSIONS.
CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMMES AT THE FRENCH LIBRARY SERVICE FROM 1976 TO
1980.

A REPORT BASED ON A FRENCH DIPLOMA DISSERTATION IN LIBRARY SCIENCE PRESENTED
IN 1980-81, EVALUATING ACTIVITIES INSTITUTED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BODY
RESPONSIBLE FOR LIBRARY AFFAIRS. THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IS
DEFINED AND THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION SUMMARISED. A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE
ORGANISATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME IS GIVEN, COVERING INITIAL
PLANNING; COURSES OFFERED IN TRAINING METHODS, MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL
SKILLS, NEW TECHNIQUES, PERSONNEL ALLOCATION, RECRUITMENT, AND DIPLOMA
TRAINING; AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PROGRAMME, WITH DETAILS OF THE
INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND EXPENDITURE, AND THE
PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY PRESENT AN EXHAUSTIVE PICTURE OF ALL
ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAMME.
THE NEW EDUCATION AT THE COLLEGE OF LIBRARIANSHIP.

DESCRIBES THE NEW COURSE IN LIBRARIANSHIP AT THE COLLEGE OF LIBRARIANSHIP
WHICH BEGAN IN AUTUMN 81. CITES THE GENERAL PLAN'S SECTION ON' AIMS, CONTENT
AND ORGANISATION, WHICH STIPULATES THAT THE COURSE IS TO LAST 4 SEMESTERS
INCLUDING PRACTICAL AND FIELD WORK, WITH TEACHING TAKING PLACE IN THE LAST 2
SEMESTERS. A LOCAL PLAN INDICATES THE COURSES AND THEIR POINT VALUE. THE
DETAILED COURSE PLANS HAVE STILL TO BE WORKED OUT. IN THE 1ST YEAR, THE
STUDENT STUDIES' SOCIETY AND LIBRARIES, KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE, HANDLING AND
DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA. IN THE 2ND YEAR THE STUDENT HAS A CHOICE BETWEEN'
CULTURE-INFORMATION (KI) AND INFORMATION-DOCUMENTATION (ID). KI INCLUDES
COURSES ON' LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND SPECIALIST LITERATURE; LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND ACTIVITIES; ADMINISTRATION. ID INCLUDES COURSES ON' LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT
RESEARCH; LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND DOCUMENTATION; ADMINISTRATION; KNOWLEDGE OF
STOCK. FOR BOTH OPTIONS THERE IS A CHOICE OF STUDI ES IN DEPTH WITH SPECIAL
PROJECTS. PLANNING GROUPS ARE NOW DEVELOPING BOTH FOLLOW-ON COURSES ON
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION, AND BRIDGING COURSES LEADING TO
QUALIFICATION IN RESEARCH.
THE USER IN LIBRARIANSHIP CURRICULA.

EXTRACT FROM A POSTGRADUATE DISSERTATION PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,
BRAZIL. WITHIN THE DISCIPLINE OF LIBRARIANSHIP, USER STUDIES ARE AN IMPORTANT
RESEARCH TOPIC, BUT THERE IS LITTLE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF USERS IN LIBRARIANSHIP
CURRICULA. TO ESTABLISH HOW THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT AREA SHOULD BE TREATED IN
TRAINING PROGRAMMES, AN ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THE LITERATURE DEALING WITH
USERS, TO ESTABLISH A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR TEACHING PURPOSES. RESULTS SHOWED
THAT THE PRIMARY FOCUS WAS ON USER BEHAVIOUR IN RELATION TO SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL FACTORS; NEEDS AND MOTIVATIONS; AND INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION IN
THE LIBRARY SITUATION. ACCORDINGLY, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, DRAWING ON,
FOR EXAMPLE, PSYCHOLOGY, ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY, SHOULD BE ADOPTED.
THE SWEDISH SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND THE EDUCATION OF
LIBRARIANS FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE BACKGROUND OF THE SWEDISH SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE (SSLIS), BORAS. PRESENTS THE CURRENT AND REVISED CURRICULA
AT THE SCHOOL. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REVISED CURRICULUM, DISCUSSES GENERAL
VERSUS SPECIALISED TRAINING, PROGRAMME FLEXIBILITY AND THE MARGINS AVAILABLE
FOR THE EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES.
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT.

ATTEMPTS A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF THE PERENNIAL DEBATE ON THE RATIONALE AND
PRACTICE OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT BY REVIEWING CURRENT ATTITUDES,
PERCEIVED NEEDS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEEDS ARE MET BY THE TEACHING
AVAILABLE. CONCLUDES THAT UNSYSTEMATIC APPROACHES TO LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT MAY BE ALIENATING SOME POTENTIAL MANAGERS.
EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION INTERMEDIARIES. AN EXAMPLE FROM THE SCHOOL OF
INFORMATION STUDIES, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, N.Y.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. THROUGH A SWEDISH AMERICAN FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIP, THE AUTHOR SPENT A
YEAR AT THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION STUDIES, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK
STATE. PRESENTS BRIEFLY PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS OF COURSES ON MANAGEMENT,
AUTOMATION, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, AND INTERPERSONAL
COMMUNICATIONS/INFORMATION TRANSFER. SUGGESTS A NEED FOR MORE EMPHASIS ON
COURSES IN MARKETING INFORMATION SERVICES AND IN DEFINING INFORMATION PROBLEMS
AND SEARCH QUESTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS SHOULD FOLLOW CLOSELY
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROFESSION AND ADAPT THEIR COURSES ACCORDINGLY.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.

OWING TO GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES THE DOCUMENTALISTS' TRAINING SCHOOL MUST
CLOSE BY 1893 AND THE PLANNED COURSE ON INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN
DARMSTADT MAY NOT AFTER ALL BEGIN IN 1982, WHICH POSES A REAL THREAT TO ALL
BASIC AND ADVANCED TRAINING COURSES. THERE IS STILL DISPUTE OVER THE VALUE OF
INTEGRATED TRAINING COURSES FOR LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS AND AS TO
WHETHER DOCUMENTALISTS SHOULD HAVE DEGREE STATUS. INFORMATION SCIENTISTS ARE
THE VITAL LINK BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND INFORMATION PRODUCED BY AN EVER WIDENING
RANGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. A UNIFIED TRAINING SYSTEM WITH GOOD PROMOTION
PROSPECTS MUST BE ESTABLISHED WITH DEGREE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE HIGHEST STAFF
GRADES. THE TRANSITION PERIOD RESULTING AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW
SYSTEM WILL DEMAND FURTHER TRAINING AFTER A BASIC QUALIFICATION HAS BEEN
OBTAINED.
TOOLS FOR UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL' A TEACHING EXPERIENCE.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE OFFERED BY THE LIBRARY SCIENCE DEPARTMENT AT THE
FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF PARANA, BRAZIL, SINCE 1976. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TRACES
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL, DEMONSTRATING ITS
IMPORTANCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HOW THE SUBJECT IS
INTEGRATED INTO THE WIDER CURRICULUM; THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF THE
COURSE; THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THE 8 COMPONENT UNITS; AND THE TEACHING METHODS
AND MATERIALS USED. FINALLY REFERENCE IS MADE TO SURVEY WORK CONDUCTED TO
MONITOR THE EFFECTS OF INTRODUCING THE SUBJECT, AND FURTHER EVIDENCE CITED TO
SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT LIBRARIANS ARE PROFITING FROM THIS INITIATIVE.
EDUCATION FOR TECHNICAL SERVICES' FIVE CASE STUDIES.

(PHD DISSERTATION-PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY). EXAMINES, DESCRIBES AND COMPARES THE
EXPECTATIONS OF PRACTITIONERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THE AREA OF TECHNICAL SERVICES
AND THE EXTENT OF TECHNICAL SERVICES AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH 5 UNIDENTIFIED
LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES TEACH WHAT EMPLOYERS EXPECT OF BEGINNING
PROFESSIONALS.
THE TEACHING OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION' A FEW RANDOM THOUGHTS.

CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION ARE CENTRAL TO THE LIBRARY PROFESSION, AND THE
KIND AND QUALITY OF LIBRARY SERVICES PROVIDED BY LIBRARIES DEPENDS GREATLY
UPON THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF THE PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS.
QUESTIONS WHO SHOULD EDUCATE THE CATALOGUERS, SUGGESTING THAT TEACHERS OF
CATALOGUING SHOULD HAVE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF FULL-TIME CATALOGUING.
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN CATALOGUING.

IDEAL STAFF FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. WITH REFERENCE TO THE SITUATION AT THE HELSINKI (FINLAND) UNIVERSITY OF
TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES, OFFERS A PERSONAL VIEW ON TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS OF
STAFF IN SUCH LIBRARIES. EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIC TRAINING IN
ENGINEERING, PHYSICS, AND CHEMISTRY; THE NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES; AND
THE NEED FOR EDUCATION IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. SUGGESTS THE OPTION
OF AN EARLIER RETIREMENT AGE FOR LIBRARY STAFF SO THAT NEW STAFF MEMBERS ARE
AS YOUNG, SERVICE-MINDED, AND NON-BUREAUCRATIC AS POSSIBLE.
REPORT FROM A COURSE FOR LIBRARIANS AT TEACHERS' TRAINING COLLEGES.

REPORT FROM A COURSE FOR LIBRARIANS AT TEACHERS' TRAINING COLLEGES, HELD IN

EDUCATION FOR WORK IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN NEW ZEALAND.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. THE BASIC NEEDS FOR THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL LIBRARIANS IN NEW ZEALAND
SEEM LIKELY TO BE MET BY THE NEW COURSES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP,
VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON, AND THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY STUDIES,
WELLINGTON TEACHERS' COLLEGE. THERE IS AN 18-WEEK SANDWICH COURSE AT THE
COLLEGE, LEADING TO THE N.Z. LIBRARY STUDIES CERTIFICATE, FOR UNTRAINED
SPECIAL LIBRARY STAFF. THE COUNTRY'S MAIN LACK WOULD SEEM TO BE A PROPERLY
ORGANISED AND COORDINATED CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR ALL LIBRARIANS.
EDUCATION FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. FROM THE US PERSPECTIVE, DISCUSSES THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION PROFESSION; OUTLINES THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION PROBLEM;
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP; DEFINES THIS SUBJECT; DISCUSSES
THE DILEMMA OF LIBRARY EDUCATION (REFLECTING THE CONFLICT OVER A LIBRARY'S
ROLES); AND COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE.
THE TEACHING PAMPHLETS PRODUCED BY THE STAFF OF THE INSTITUTE OF LIBRARY
SCIENCE AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY, BERLIN.

THE PAMPHLET SERIES DEVELOPED SINCE 1970, ORIGINALLY FOR USE IN CORRESPONDENCE
COURSES ON BASIC AND POST-GRADUATE LIBRARIANSHIP, BUT IS NOW USED ALSO IN
CLASSES AT THE LIBRARY SCHOOL. THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY COMBINES A BASIC
TRAINING FOR BOTH LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS WITH ADDITIONAL SPECIALIST
OPTIONS; THE STRUCTURE OF THE BASIC LIBRARY SCHOOL AND CORRESPONDENCE COURSES
IS IDENTICAL. THE PAMPHLETS PROVIDE AN INTRODUCTION FOR THE STUDENT TO WORK
WITH READERS, INFORMATION WORK, LIBRARY STOCKS, CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY,
DOCUMENTATION AND STORAGE AND POLITICAL STUDIES. THE SERIES WILL EXPAND TO
INCLUDE MORE DETAILED MONOGRAPHS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, AS HAS
ALREADY HAPPENED WITH A SIMILAR SERIES PRODUCED IN THE USSR.
TRAINING OF EGYPTIAN INFORMATION SPECIALISTS' A MULTIFACETED SYSTEM APPROACH.

DISCUSSES THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A 2-YEAR, NON-DEGREE TRAINING SYSTEM
TO TRAIN EGYPTIAN INFORMATION SPECIALISTS IN THE USA. THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES OF
THE TRAINING SYSTEM WERE TO TRAIN A CORE GROUP OF INFORMATION SPECIALISTS IN
THE TECHNICAL SKILLS REQUIRED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION
SERVICES IN EGYPT. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS, AN
INTEGRATED, MULTIFACETED TRAINING SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED UTILISING SEVERAL
TRAINING STRATEGIES.
LIBRARIES AND NEWSROOMS IN LANCASTER, PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THE PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ACT IN 1892 AND A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES FROM 1893-1974.

(DIPLOMA IN LIBRARY STUDIES THESIS.) A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT
OF LIBRARIES OF ALL KINDS IN LANCASTER, UK, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF WORKING
CLASS POVERTY AND RISING MIDDLE CLASS AFFLUENCE.
VITAL NEEDS OF LIBRARIES.

FOR YEARS NOW LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE
EXAMPLE OF THEIR SOVIET COUNTERPARTS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. TARGETS FOR BULGARIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENT AND THE POPULATION'S HIGHER LIVING STANDARD IN THE 1980S MAKE THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF SOVIET LITERATURE AND PERIODICALS STILL MORE OBVIOUS.
CONCENTRATING UPON CONCRETE TASKS AND PROBLEMS IN THEIR AREA, LIBRARIANS MUST
SUPPLY THEIR READERS AND OTHERS WORKING IN LOCAL INDUSTRIES, RESEARCH
INSTITUTES, SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION. SOVIET SOURCES,
SUCH AS TECHNICAL PERIODICALS HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN THE PAST AND WILL
CONTINUE TO BE IN THE FUTURE. LIBRARIANS CAN RELY UPON ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY THE
STAFF AT THE HOUSE OF SOVIET SCIENCE AND CULTURE IN SOFIA. PARTNERSHIPS WITH
SOVIET LIBRARIES HAVE ALSO PROVEN VALUABLE. SOME VENTURES FROM THE PLEVEN
REGION (NORTHERN BULGARIA) ARE GIVEN AS EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PROMOTION OF
SOVI ET LITERATURE AND EXPERIENCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP AMONG THE BULGARIAN PUBLIC.
NOTES ON A VISIT TO JAPAN.

AN ACCOUNT OF 4 LIBRARIES VISITED DURING A FEW DAYS' STAY IN TOKYO IN FEB 81.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF BUILDINGS, LAYOUT, HOLDINGS, SERVICES, USERS AND
PERSONNEL, FOR THE DIET LIBRARY, TOKYO METROPOLITAN CENTRAL LIBRARY, THE
KITASATO MEMORIAL MEDICAL LIBRARY, AND THE FRANCO-JAPANESE INSTITUTE LIBRARY,
THE PRINCIPAL FRENCH-LANGUAGE LIBRARY IN JAPAN. IN CONCLUSION, THE PROBLEMS
FACED BY JAPANESE LIBRARIANS ARE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED.
BRAZILIAN LIBRARIES AS SEEN BY LIBRARIANS AND USERS.

ANSWERS OBTAINED TO A QUESTIONNAIRE CIRCULATED TO PROMINENT BRAZILIAN
INTELLECTUALS AND LIBRARIANS AS A PRELIMINARY TO A SURVEY OF ALL BRAZILIAN
LIBRARIANS AND USERS. 4 USERS, COMPRISING A PROFESSOR, 2 WRITERS, AND A
TEACHER, EACH DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LIBRARIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
BRAZILIAN CULTURE AND THE TRAINING OF INTELLECTUALS; 11 LIBRARIANS FROM
UNIVERSITIES, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND LIBRARY SCIENCE
SCHOOLS, DISCUSS THE FACTORS IMPEDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND
PREVENTING PUBLIC ACCESS.
THE COMMERCIAL CIRCULATING LIBRARY IN THE 1970S.

THE HOPES PLACED IN THE 'TUPPENNY' LIBRARY IN THE 1930S WERE SEEN TO BE
SHORT-LIVED BY THE 1950S. CIRCULATING LIBRARIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE FROM
WHICH BOOKS WERE BORROWED THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION OR SMALL FEES PAID TO THE
BUSINESS CONCERNS PROVIDING THEM. THEY WERE PRIMARILY FOR RECREATIONAL
READING, AND AGENTS INCLUDED HARROD'S, BOOTS AND SMALLER SHOPS. STOCK WAS
BOUGHT OR OBTAINED THROUGH SUPPLIERS SUCH AS ALLIED LIBRARIES IN MANCHESTER,
WHO DECLINED IN THAT PART OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND CLOSED IT IN 1975, AND SOUTH
COUNTY LIBRARIES WHO SUPPLIED TO 6,000-7,000 AGENTS AFTER THE WAR, AND TO LESS
THAN 150 IN 1978. SOME AGENTS WERE RELUCTANT TO CLOSE, BECAUSE OF CUSTOMER
RELATIONS, WHILE YOUNGER SHOP OWNERS WERE OFTEN UNINTERESTED.
INFORMATION SERVICE ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL SUBJECT COLLECTION LIBRARIES AND
CENTRAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES.

IN 1973 THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION) MADE
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE LIBRARIES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF
SUPER-REGIONAL LIBRARY PROVISION. ALTHOUGH STANDARDS GENERALLY HAVE RISEN
SINCE THEN, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON ACQUIRING EXAMINATION SYLLABUS LITERATURE AT THE
EXPENSE OF RESEARCH MATERIAL. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BE PROVIDING TOPICAL AND
COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SERVICES ON THEIR SPECIALISED SUBJECTS AND A
CLEARING HOUSE IS NEEDED TO SORT OUT THE EXISTING JUNGLE OF INFORMATION
SOURCES. CURRENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE DISCUSSED FOR'
PERIODICAL INDEXING; SUBJECT CATALOGUES OF PERIODICALS; SUBJECT CATALOGUES OF
LIBRARIES; CURRENT SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHIES; AND ACQUISITIONS LISTS.
THE PEACE PALACE LIBRARY.

THE PEACE PALACE IN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS AROSE OUT OF THE 1ST HAGUE PEACE
CONFERENCE IN 1899. CONSTRUCTION OF THE PALACE, WHICH WAS FINANCED BY ANDREW
CARNEGIE, WAS BEGUN IN 1907 AND THE BUILDING WAS OPENED IN 1913. THE LIBRARY
OF THE PEACE PALACE SERVES THE PERMANENT COURT OF JUSTICE, THE UNITED NATIONS
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE HAGUE ACADEMY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, ALL
OF WHICH ORGANISATIONS ARE SITUATED IN THE PEACE PALACE. THE LIBRARY ALSO
PROVIDES A SERVICE TO EXTERNAL USERS, INCLUDING FOREIGN EMBASSY STAFF,
SPECIALISTS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INDUSTRIAL LAWYERS EMPLOYED BY
MULTINATIONAL CONCERNS. THE COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 580,000 VOLUMES
AND ACCESSIONS AMOUNT TO SOME 2,500 NEW TITLES EACH YEAR.
THE LIBRARY OF THE FINNISH PARLIAMENT.

THE FINNISH LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT WAS FOUNDED IN 1872. AT PRESENT IT COMPRISES
APPROXIMATELY 430,000 VOLUMES, A STAFF OF 34 PEOPLE AND SINCE 1978 IT HAS BEEN
LOCATED IN NEW PREMISES OF ABOUT 5000 SQ.M. IN AN ANNEX TO THE PARLIAMENT
BUILDING. UNLIKE SIMILAR LIBRARIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE LIBRARY OF THE
FINNISH PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FROM AS EARLY AS 1913. FROM
1919-22 IT FUNCTIONED AS THE STATE CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM
PARLIAMENT EVEN IN ITS ADMINISTRATION.
THE LIBRARY OF THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT 1851-1980.

THE 'RIKSDAG' (THE LIBRARY OF THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT) STARTED ITS WORK IN
1851, PROVIDING A SERVICE TO A POPULAR ASSEMBLY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
CLERGY, NOBLE FAMILIES, THE BURGHERS AND PEASANTRY. A DETAILED HISTORICAL
REVIEW OF THE LIBRARY IS FOLLOWED BY SECTIONS ON ITS PRESENT DAY ORGANISATION,

LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE ARMED FORCES IN NORWAY.

74 LIBRARIES SERVE THE NORWEGIAN ARMED FORCES. WELFARE SERVICES ARE AN
INTEGRAL PART OF THE GENERAL CARE AND ADMINISTRATION OF DEFENCE PERSONNEL AND
THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS A SECTION OF THE DEFENCE WELFARE SERVICE. THE LARGER
LIBRARIES STOCK AROUND 5,000 VOLUMES, WHILE THE SMALLER ONES HAVE 900-1,000.
IN RECENT YEARS ALL 74 LIBRARIES HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME NEW BOOKS, IN ORDER TO
PROVIDE THE SAME SELECTION TO EACH UNIT AND SOME LIBRARIES HAVE BEGUN TO
PROVIDE MUSIC COLLECTIONS.
EVANGELICAL PARISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES PAST AND PRESENT.

PROTESTANT PARISH LIBRARIES IN GERMANY BEGAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY, PARTLY
THROUGH MISSIONARY IMPULSES AND PARTLY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCHOOL
SYSTEM. THEIR WORK WAS INTERRUPTED IN THE 1930S AND BEGAN AGAIN IN 1945, WHEN
WALTER SCHWARZ AND EVA LINDBER REFOUNDED THE DEUTSCHE VERBAND EVANGELISCHER
BUCHEREIEN (GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICAL LIBRARIES), WHICH HAS OVERALL
CONTROL OF THE PARISH LIBRARIES, PROVIDING ADVICE, ORGANISING CONFERENCES AND
COMPILING STATISTICS. A LIBRARY SCHOOL WAS FOUNDED WHICH HAD TO CLOSE IN THE
1970S THROUGH LACK OF FUNDS. THE PARISH LIBRARIES ARE STAFFED MAINLY BY
VOLUNTEERS, FOR WHOM SHORT TRAINING COURSES ARE PROVIDED, WITH PROFESSIONAL
STAFF IN TOP POSTS. A QUARTERLY PERIODICAL IS PUBLISHED CONTAINING LIBRARY
NEWS AND 1,800 REVIEWS ANNUALLY OF NEW PUBLICATIONS, FOR ONE OF WHICH AN
ANNUAL BOOK PRIZE IS AWARDED.
CATHOLIC LIBRARY WORK IN GERMANY.

THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES DEVELOPED IN THE 19TH CENTURY WITH THE
ADVENT OF POPULAR EDUCATION. THE LIBRARIES ARE TO BE FOUND TODAY IN HOSPITALS,
AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE PARISHES; THEIR AIM IS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION,
SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND HELP FOR THE UNDERPRIVILEGED. THE LARGEST HAVE STOCKS
OF UP TO 30,000 ITEMS BUT AVERAGE TOTALS ARE BETWEEN 1,500-5,000 ITEMS OF
LENDING AND REFERENCE MATERIAL FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. STAFF ARE MAINLY
VOLUNTEERS, ALTHOUGH FULL-TIME PROFESSIONALS ARE EMPLOYED IN THE DIOCESAN
CENTRES, RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING AND FINANCE, STAFF TRAINING AND
REPRESENTATION OF LIBRARY INTERESTS WITHIN THEIR DIOCESE. OVERALL CONTROL IS
MAINTAINED BY ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE IN BAVARIA AND BY THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION
IN THE REST OF GERMANY, WHO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF CENTRALISED SERVICES.
STATE SUPPORT FOR ECCLESIASTICAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA.

DURING THE LAST 30 YEARS IT HAS BEEN AFFIRMED THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES RUN BY THE CHURCHES IS NEEDED AT STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE
THEY ARE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. CHURCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACHIEVEMENTS AT THIS TIME
INCLUDE STOCK INCREASES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF STAFF TRAINING AND SOCIAL SERVICE
WITHIN LIBRARIANSHIP. IT IS DISPUTED AS TO WHETHER THEY ARE RELIGIOUS RATHER
THAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND WHETHER CENTRALISED SERVICES FOR THEM ARE TOO
COSTLY. THE SMALLER BRANCHES COULD BE REGARDED AS A HINDRANCE TO THE MOBILE
LIBRARIES AND THE USE OF VOLUNTARY STAFF COULD BE AN EXCUSE NOT TO EMPLOY
FULL-TIME ADMINISTRATORS. A PLURALITY OF LIBRARY AUTHORITIES CAN BE REGARDED
AS ECONOMIC. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS PROVIDED BY THE
STATE, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE THE CHURCH LIBRARY MAY BE THE ONLY PUBLIC
LIBRARY.
EVANGELICAL LIBRARY WORK IN BAVARIA.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. PROTESTANT PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA ARE RUN BY
THE BAVARIAN BRANCH OF THE GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICAL LIBRARIES WHICH
PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN RETURN FOR SOME
FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THE LIBRARIES, OPEN TO ALL, HAVE STOCKS COMPARABLE WITH
SMALL BRANCH LIBRARIES; THEY ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN UNDERPRIVILEGED
RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY ACT AS CENTRES FOR COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE. STAFF ARE
MAINLY VOLUNTARY WORKERS FOR WHOM PART-TIME TRAINING COURSES ARE ARRANGED. THE
ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES A QUARTERLY INFORMATION SHEET FOR BAVARIA AND A
QUARTERLY PERIODICAL COVERING THE WHOLE OF GERMANY. THE BAVARIAN BRANCH
MAINTAINS A CENTRAL LIBRARY OF 29,000 VOLUMES TO SUPPLEMENT SMALL LIBRARY
STOCKS, ORGANISING BLOCK LOANS TO THEM AND TO OTHER INTERESTED BODIES SUCH AS
YOUTH CLUBS AND ORGANISERS OF RETIREMENT COURSES.
ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE' AN EXAMPLE OF ROYAL BAVARIAN INDEPENDENCE.

THE ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE WAS FOUNDED IN 1901 AS AN EDUCATIONAL ORGANISATION
FOR PUBLISHING NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS AND CONTROLLING THE ROMAN CATHOLIC
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA. EACH PARISH LIBRARY IS SUBORDINATE TO ITS
DIOCESAN CENTRE AND THE STATE LIBRARY CENTRE PROVIDES A NUMBER OF CENTRALISED
SERVICES AND OVERALL ADMINISTRATION. THE LEAGUE PUBLISHES A REVIEWING JOURNAL
JOINTLY WITH THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION, A QUARTERLY INFORMATION SHEET ON
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN BAVARIA, BOOK LISTS AND A HANDBOOK FOR THE USE OF THE
STAFF, MAINLY VOLUNTEERS, FOR WHOM SHORT TRAINING COURSES ARE PROVIDED. CLOSE
COOPERATION IS MAINTAINED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SINCE 1968 THE LEAGUE HAS
COMPILED ANNUAL STATISTICS BY ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING; THE PROGRAMME IS
ALSO USED EVERY 3 YEARS FOR THE COMPILATION OF STATISTICS ON ALL CHURCH
LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY.
ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE, STATE GROUP FOR BAVARIA' THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE ROMAN
CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO LITERATURE PROVISION IN LOWER BAVARIA AND THE
UPPER RHINELAND PALATINATE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THIS AREA ARE
ADMINISTERED BY ST. MICHAEL'S LEAGUE. THE LIBRARY SERVICE, FOUNDED AT THE
BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY, DEVELOPED INTO ITS PRESENT FORM AFTER 1945. IN
1979, IN THE WHOLE OF BAVARIA, THE LEAGUE CONTROLLED 1,273 LIBRARIES STOCKING
OVER 3 MILLION MEDIA; LOANS TOTALLED OVER 6 MILLION, WITH OVER 6,000 STAFF,
MAINLY VOLUNTEERS. THE PARISH LIBRARIES ARE CONTROLLED BY DIOCESAN CENTRES
WHICH EMPLOY PROFESSIONAL, FULLTIME STAFF, PROVIDE ADVICE FOR SMALLER
LIBRARIES AND ARRANGE STAFF TRAINING PROGRAMMES. THE DIOCESAN CENTRES ARE IN
TURN SUBORDINATE TO THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRE IN MUNICH, WHICH IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANISING CENTRAL PURCHASING AND INTERLOANS AND PUBLISHING A
NNUAL REPORTS, STATISTICS AND QUARTERLY INFORMATION SHEETS. A PROFESSIONAL
JOURNAL IS PUBLISHED JOINTLY WITH THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION, RESPONSIBLE FOR
ROMAN CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES OUTSIDE BAVARIA.
JOINT-USE LIBRARIES IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY.

PROCEEDINGS OF A NATIONAL WORKSHOP, MELBOURNE, 13-15 AUG 80. DEFINES A
JOINT-USE LIBRARY AS ONE WHERE 2 OR MORE DISTINCT GROUPS OF USERS ARE GIVEN
EQUAL PRIORITY IN THE SAME PREMISES, THE GOVERNANCE OF WHICH IS COOPERATIVELY
ARRANGED BETWEEN 2 OR MORE SEPARATE AUTHORITIES. EMPHASIS OF THE CONFERENCE
WAS PLACED ON THE INTEGRATION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES WITH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES TO GIVE A COORDINATED SERVICE. THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE DELIVERED'
JOINT-USE LIBRARIES IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, BY J.D. DWER; JOINT-USE
LIBRARIES IN COLLEGES, BY A.J. BROWN; JOINT USE LIBRARIES IN COMMUNITY
CENTRES, BY G. FRASER.
INTER-LIBRARY COMPARISONS: A REPORT ON PROGRESS WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO
PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

INTERLIBRARY COMPARISONS AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL ARE DESCRIBED. A GENERAL OUTLINE
OF INTERFIRM COMPARISONS AS A TOOL IN MANAGEMENT IS FOLLOWED BY A DESCRIPTION
OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT BY THE CENTRE FOR INTERFIRM COMPARISON, FUNDED BY
BRITISH LIBRARY R&D, INTO INTERLIBRARY COMPARISONS. THE FINAL PART DESCRIBES
THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE MAIN COMPARISON SO FAR UNDERTAKEN FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA 1979-80.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA, INCLUDING THOSE RUN BY THE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THOSE RUN BY THE CHURCHES, IS 2,343. 94.8% OF TOWNS AND
VILLAGES LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE THEIR OWN BRANCH LIBRARIES DO HAVE THEM. 46% OF
LIBRARIES STOCK UNDER 3,000 ITEMS, ONLY 4% STOCK OVER 30,000. IN 1980 22.5
MILLION LOANS WERE MADE TO OVER 1 MILLION READERS AND TOTAL EXPENDITURE
AMOUNTED TO 97.1 MILLION DM. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
HAS SHOWN POSITIVE RESULTS. NEW BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, OLD ONES
EXTENDED AND IMPROVED. THERE ARE MORE QUALIFIED STAFF EMPLOYED AND BETTER
STAFF TRAINING PROGRAMMES THAN BEFORE. AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, PUBLICITY WORK AND
THE REGIONAL INTER-LOAN SYSTEM HAVE BECOME MORE PROMINENT. MORE REFERENCE
WORKS ARE STILL NEEDED AND MORE LITERATURE FOR FOREIGN CHILDREN.
ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.

FOR ARTICLES IN THIS ISSUE, SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SWEDEN.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK IS WELL DEVELOPED AND REACHES LARGE GROUPS OF
THE POPULATION THROUGH ITS OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT
ALMOST &H THE ADULT POPULATION AND 80-90% OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE VISITED A LIBRARY IN THE LAST YEAR. MODERN DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ACCELERATED
DURING THE 1970S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE FUSION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. SWEDEN
HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT, BUT THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT DECIDED TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM
OF STATE GRANTS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND REGIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. STATE
GRANTS AMOUNT TO 2.5% OF THE TOTAL OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BUT
THEY HAVE PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES THANKS TO THEIR
STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT.
BIBLIOTEKSTJANST-A PRESENTATION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
BIBLIOTEKSTJANST IS THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE, WHOSE MAIN TASK IS TO HELP
STREAMLINE THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT ALMOST ALL TYPES
OF LIBRARY WORK CAN BE CONDUCTED MORE EFFICIENTLY AND RATIONALLY WITH THE AID
OF CENTRALLY PRODUCED SERVICES AND AIDS. BIBLIOTEKSTJANST, AS THE CENTRAL
SERVICE ORGAN, HAS THUS ACQUIRED A VERY WIDE FIELD OF OPERATION.
PROJECT PROGRESS' A STUDY OF THE CANADIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE FINAL REPORT OF A STUDY SPONSORED BY THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN
ORDER TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL INFORMATION AS A BASE FOR PLANNING AND DECISIONS.
THIS INCLUDES BOTH SPECIFIC MATTERS OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION, COST-BENEFIT
ANALYSIS, PERSONNEL AND DEMOGRAPHY AND MORE GENERAL QUESTIONS OF SOCIAL,
POLITICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.
CHILDREN, LIBRARIES AND COMICS IN MEXICO.

DESCRIBES A VISIT TO MEXICO AND THE US FINANCED BENJAMIN FRANKLIN LIBRARY IN
GUADELAJARA BRIEFLY. THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ATTACHED TO THE 'CENTRO SOCIAL
MORELOS' IN AGUASCALIENTES SUFFERS FROM LACK OF SPACE AND MATERIAL, AND THE
UNQUALIFIED LIBRARIAN'S MAIN DUTY IS TO KEEP ORDER. FEW PUBLIC LIBRARIES LEND
BOOKS. THE STREAM OF PULP MAGAZINES AND COMICS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN IS NOW
BEING COUNTERED BY THE STATE, WHO PUBLISHES MATERIAL IN SIMILAR STYLE, BUT
BETTER CONTENT. THE LIBRARY IN SAN CRISTOBAL RECEIVES MONEY FOR STAFF SALARIES
BUT NONE FOR BOOKS. LIKE OTHER LIBRARIES, BIBLIOTECA DE MEXICO IS USED MAINLY
BY STUDENTS. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CAME ON A MORE ORGANISED FOOTING IN
1978, AND AS NO SCHOOL LIBRARIES EXIST, CREATION OF CHILDREN'S SECTIONS IS
RECEIVING PRIORITY. THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR THE LIBRARIANS TRAINED AT THE 6
UNIVERSITIES BUT MANY ARE ATTRACTED INTO PRIVATE FIRMS. CONTINUITY OF LIBRARY
PLANNING IS HAMPERED BY THE CHANGES OF  CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION EVERY 6 YEARS.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN COLOMBIA.

IN COLOMBIA, PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION SOME 40 YEARS;
RESPONSIBILITY TODAY LIES WITH THE INSTITUTO COLOMBIANO DE CULTURA, THE
COLOMBIAN INSTITUTE OF CULTURE, (COLCULTURA) WHICH HAS RECENTLY CREATED A
PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK AS PART OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF HOW PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES OPERATE WITHIN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION
FRAMEWORK, AND SERVE IMMEDIATE USER NEEDS AT LOCAL LEVEL. CURRENT ACTIVITIES
AND PROGRAMMES ARE OUTLINED, AND 2 NEW INITIATIVES, THE HOUSE OF CULTURE, AND
THE INTEGRATED CULTURAL CENTRES, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE
SERVICES THAN CONVENTIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES, DESCRIBED. FINALLY THE STRUCTURE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK IS DELINEATED.
BIBLIOTHEQUES CENTRALES DE PRET. 1979 STATISTICS.

REPORT OF THE OFFICIAL 1979 SURVEY, COVERING 73 BIBLIOTHEQUES CENTRALES DE
PRET SERVING RURAL POPULATIONS IN FRANCE. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF RESOURCES IN
TERMS OF FINANCE, HOLDINGS, PERSONNEL, BUILDINGS, AND VEHICLES, TOGETHER WITH
STATISTICS ON BOOKS LOANED TO VILLAGE AND SCHOOL DEPOTS. PUBLICATIONS ISSUED
AND PROMOTION OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS EXHIBITIONS AND CONFERENCES, ARE
DISCUSSED, AND TRAINING PROGRAMMES REVIEWED. ALL DATA IS TABULATED IN FULL IN
APPENDICES.
THE EXPANSION OF THE RURAL LIBRARY SERVICE IN BAVARIA WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BAVARIAN LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 29TH CONFERENCE OF STATE LIBRARY CENTRES IN WEST GERMANY,
BURGHAUSEN, SEPT 81. BASIC PROVISION OF STOCKS AND STAFF IS STILL NOT AS GOOD
IN RURAL AS IN URBAN AREAS; FURTHER FINANCIAL PROVISION FROM THE STATE IS
NECESSARY IF LIBRARY SERVICES ARE TO BE IMPROVED. PLANS FOR IMPROVING BAVARIAN
LIBRARIES ARE LINKED CLOSELY WITH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES. EVERY VILLAGE
WITH OVER 3,000 INHABITANTS HAS A BRANCH LIBRARY AND SMALLER VILLAGES ARE
SERVED BY MOBILE LIBRARIES, MORE OF WHICH ARE STILL NEEDED. CLOSURE OF MANY
SMALL BRANCH LIBRARIES HAS RESULTED IN A CONCENTRATION OF SERVICES AND IN
INCREASED STOCKS AND READERSHIP. COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES AND BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITY AND CHURCH PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS VERY
IMPORTANT.
VESTMANNAEYJAR PUBLIC LIBRARY' FRAGMENTS FROM THE HISTORY OF AN ICELANDIC
PUBLIC LIBRARY.

THE VESTMANNAEYJAR PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST POVERTY, LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING, AND ULTIMATELY TO STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL. A LONG-STANDING
STRUGGLE FOR PROPER LIBRARY PREMISES HAS TAKEN PLACE; THE LIBRARY, HAVING FEW
MEANS, WAS MOVED FROM 1 TEMPORARY PLACE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT COULD BE MOVED
INTO A NEW BUILDING IN 1970. IN FEB 73 A VOLCANIC ERUPTION HIT THE HEIMAEY AND
DESTROYED THE LIBRARY, BUT THE BOOKS WERE RESCUED. IT IS THOUGHT THE LIBRARY
IS THE ONLY 1 IN THE WORLD TO BE RESCUED FROM VOLCANIC ERUPTION.
BOOKS AT THE WORKPLACE: ARE WORKPLACE LIBRARIES NEEDED?.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
QUESTIONS THE NEED FOR WORKPLACE LIBRARIES IN SWEDEN VIS-A-VIS PROVISION OF
PUBLIC AND BRANCH LIBRARIES. IN FACT, ALMOST 2/3 OF THE SWEDISH POPULATION DO
NOT REGULARLY USE THEIR LOCAL MUNICIPAL LIBRARY-THEY HAVE NOT DISCOVERED THE
LIBRARY AS AN INTELLECTUAL RESOURCE, OR AS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE AND EMOTIONAL
EXPERIENCE. SUGGESTS THE BENEFITS WHICH LIBRARY USE CAN AFFORD THE POPULATION,
AND SEES THE PAUCITY OF USAGE AS A WARNING SIGNAL TO SCHOOL STAFF, POPULAR
EDUCATIONISTS AND TRADE UNIONS.
SKAMOKOWA STORY' RURAL LIBRARY SERVICE IN WASHINGTON STATE.

SKAMOKAWA, A VILLAGE OF 250 POPULATION, IN WASHINGTON'S 2ND SMALLEST COUNTY,
WAHKIAKUM, HAS, IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, GAINED A LIBRARY. THE NUCLEUS OF THE
COLLECTION CAME FROM THE LOCAL SCHOOL, BUT THE LIBRARY NOW BOASTS A BOOK
COLLECTION, PAPERBACKS, INTERLIBRARY LOAN SERVICES, A FILM BORROWING SERVICE,
AND A REFERENCE SERVICE. VOLUNTEERS PROVIDE REMEDIAL READING, TUTORING, AND
INSTRUCTION IN FRENCH. THE LIBRARY IS DEPENDENT ON DONATED FUNDS, AND
FUND-RAISING IS AN EVER PRESENT CHORE. VOLUNTEER HELP IS ERRATIC AND LACK OF
TIME HAS PREVENTED THE LIBRARIAN FROM CATALOGUING THE COLLECTION. THE LIBRARY
SUCCEEDS, ULTIMATELY, THROUGH COMMUNITY DETERMINATION, AND, OPERATING ON THE
PREMISE THAT SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING, CARES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BY
PROVIDING WHAT IS REALLY WANTED BY THE POPULATION IT SERVES.
LIBRARIES ON THE MOVE? SCOTTISH RURAL MOBILES.

MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS AND PRACTICES DIFFER WIDELY IN RURAL
SCOTLAND WITH NO 1 AUTHORITY ADHERING RIGIDLY TO ANY STANDARD. WHERE AND WHEN
A MOBILE STOPS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ITS USE. AS MOST VISITS ARE ON
WEEKDAYS BETWEEN 9.00 AM AND 5.00 PM, MORE WOMEN THAN MEN USE THE SERVICE.
MOST USERS LIVE WITHIN 1/4 OF A MILE OF A STOPPING POINT. THE SERVICE IS
GREATLY VALUED BY USERS VALUED BY USERS ALTHOUGH IT IS GENERALLY INFERIOR TO A
STATIC BRANCH. NEVERTHELESS, URGENT STUDY IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY RURAL
DWELLERS' NEEDS SO THAT THE APPROPRIATE SERVICE CAN BE PROVIDED.
THE USE OF SUBJECT SPECIALISTS IN SUHL DISTRICT PUBLIC RESEARCH LIBRARY.

THE DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARY IS NEW TO EAST GERMANY. THE LARGE, HIGH-QUALITY
STOCK IS HELPFUL FOR THE REGIONAL STOCK-BUILDING PROGRAMME; MOST DOMESTIC
PUBLICATIONS ARE ACQUIRED TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN WORKS NEEDED FOR RESEARCH.
EACH DEPARTMENT IS CONTROLLED BY A SUBJECT SPECIALIST RESPONSIBLE FOR STOCKS,
CATALOGUING, ADVISORY AND INFORMATION WORK, ORGANISATION, STAFF TRAINING AND
COORDINATION WITH INDUSTRY AND OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. IN SUHL THERE ARE
SUBJECT SPECIALISTS FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SOCIAL SCIENCE, CHILDREN'S
BOOKS, EARTH SCIENCES AND MUSIC. SUCH DEMANDING POSTS REQUIRE UNIVERSITY
GRADUATES WITH DETAILED BIBLIOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE AND AN ADDITIONAL
QUALIFICATION IN LIBRARIANSHIP. IT MIGHT ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN SUBJECT
SPECIALISTS FROM THE RANKS OF GRADUATE TEACHERS.
THE WORK OF A COUNTY DEPARTMENT.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
DESCRIBES THE WORK OF SWEDEN'S JAMTLAND COUNTY, WHICH COMPRISES 2
PROVINCES-JAMTLAND AND HARJEDALEN. THE COUNTY IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF DENMARK,
BUT WITH ONLY 135,000 INHABITANTS, 40% OF WHOM LIVE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF
OSTERSUND. DISTANCES BETWEEN TOWNS ARE VAST. THE OSTERSUND LIBRARY BECAME THE
OFFICIAL COUNTY LIBRARY IN 1947. COUNTY DEPARTMENT WORK VARIES FROM COUNTY TO
COUNTY, AND COMPARISONS SHOW THAT SWEDISH COUNTY DEPARTMENTS WORK MORE
FLEXIBLY THAN, SAY, FINLAND'S PROVINCIAL LIBRARIES.
BOOKS BY BOAT TO THE ARCHIPELAGO POPULATION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN. OFF THE
COAST OF SWEDEN'S BOHUS COUNTY LIE OVER 3,000 ISLANDS, MANY INHIBITED BUT
LACKING PERMANENT COMMUNICATION WITH THE MAINLAND. EACH APRIL AND SEPTEMBER A
'BOOK BOAT' SETS OUT FROM THE GOTHENBURG COUNTY LIBRARY FOR A 2-WEEK TRIP
ALONG THE 120-MILE COASTLINE. IN 1981 IT LENT OVER 18,000 VOLUMES FROM 49
LENDING POINTS. DESCRIBES THE BOAT'S ORGANISATION, STAFFING, FUNCTIONS AND
OPERATIONS.
A HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BOLTON FROM THE BEGINNINGS TO 1974.

(PH.D THESIS). AN OUTLINE OF THE MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT OF BOLTON, LANCASHIRE,
IS FOLLOWED BY AN ACCOUNT OF ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED IN THE
TOWN BEFORE THE FIRST PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT OF 1850 IN 1852. A DETAILED
EVALUATIVE HISTORY OF THE RATE-SUPPORTED PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IS GIVEN, FROM
THE WORK OF THE FIRST LIBRARY COMMITTEE IN 1852-53 TO THE RETIREMENT OF THE
CHIEF LIBRARIAN IN 1974.
A HISTORY OF SWANSEA PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1870-1974.

(FLA THESIS). CONCENTRATES ON THE YEARS 1870-1920, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON

THE PUBLIC.
MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. 1979 STATISTICS.

THE OFFICIAL 1979 STATISTICS FOR FRENCH MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, PRESENTED IN A
SERIES OF TABLES, COVERING RESOURCES AND EXPENDITURE; LOANS OF BOOKS AND
RECORDS; AND DEPOSITS OF BOOKS IN ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS. RESULTS ARE
SHOWN IN RELATION TO DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORY, WITH NATIONAL TOTALS.
PROBLEMS AND TASKS OF LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION.

LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR EXISTING PREMISES AS
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS HAS BEEN SEVERELY RESTRICTED, AT LEAST
FOR THE TIME BEING. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE CONDITIONS, LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES MUST BE UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW WITH THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN
MIND. BRANCHES ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDENTS' HALLS OF RESIDENCE HAVE TO PROVIDE
ALL STUDENTS WITH BASIC STUDY LITERATURE. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ANY
PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT HAS TO CATER FOR CENTRALISED AND COORDINATED
ACQUISITIONS AND PROCESSING. USE OF LITERATURE BY STUDENTS AND TEACHING STAFF
MUST ALSO BE FOLLOWED UP AND OBSOLETE ITEMS DISCARDED. GREATER ATTENTION MUST
BE PAID TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE DEALING WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES,
ESPECIALLY IN FACULTIES OF APPLIED SCIENCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT
AESTHETIC EDUCATION BY AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS. THE ROLE OF COMPUTERISED
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, NOW ON A TRIAL BASIS IN SCHOOLS OF ECON OMICS, WILL GROW
IN FUTURE. FOR EXPERT ADVICE LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE TO LOOK ABOVE
ALL TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA WITH ITS METHODOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT AND
SPECIAL COUNCILS IN MANY SPHERES OF KNOWLEDGE.
CULTURE STATISTICS. UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES IN CANADA. 1978-79.

RESULTS OF A STATISTICAL SURVEY OF UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES FOR THE
PERIOD 1978-79.
AN INDIAN LIBRARIAN LOOKS AT THE PROGRESS OF AMERICAN LIBRARIES IN 1960S AND
1970S.

THE PERIOD IN QUESTION SAW A RAPID GROWTH IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WHICH
REACHED A PEAK AROUND 1974. LOCALISED LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS ABANDONED IN
FAVOUR OF COOPERATIVE NETWORKS AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS THE RISE OF THE
PHENOMENON OF ON-LINE DATA BASE REFERENCE SERVICES SUCH AS DIALOG.
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-MEDIA LEARNING
RESOURCES CENTRES. LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION BECAME LESS HIERARCHICAL IN THE
EARLY 1970S WITH MORE TRADE UNION INVOLVEMENT IN EVIDENCE. THE WORSENING
ECONOMIC SITUATION AFTER 1974 LEFT ITS MARK WITH THE DRYING UP OF LIBRARY
VACANCIES AND NOTICEABLE PRESSURE ON LIBRARY RESOURCES.
COVER PICTURE.

ULM UNIVERSITY WAS OFFICIALLY OPENED IN 1967 IN A FORMER MONASTERY AND THE
LIBRARY HAS NO PURPOSE-BUILT CENTRAL PREMISES, ALTHOUGH DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES
FOR MEDICINE AND ASSOCIATED SUBJECTS ARE CENTRALLY ADMINISTERED. THE TOTAL
STOCK COMPRISES 450,000 VOLUMES AND 3,500 CURRENT PERIODICALS OF WHICH 28% ARE
SCATTERED IN FORMER MONASTIC CELLS ON 4 DIFFERENT STOREYS. FACULTY LIBRARIES
ARE LINKED BY A DAILY COURIER SERVICE. MOST OF THE BOOKSTOCK IS AVAILABLE FOR
LOAN; PERIODICALS ARE PHOTOCOPIED ON REQUEST. OVER 80% OF REQUESTS ARE MET
FROM THE LIBRARY'S OWN STOCK.
THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF CHRIST CHURCH LIBRARY, OXFORD.

BOOKS WERE FIRST TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW CHRIST CHURCH LIBRARY BUILDING IN
PECKWATER QUADRANGLE IN THE PERIOD 1763-70. THE POST OF LIBRARY KEEPER WAS
FILLED BY A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE. INITIALLY THE LIBRARY ONLY SERVED
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE. IN 1869 A LIBRARY COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED TO
OVERSEE THE PURCHASE OF BOOKS AND THE COMPILING AND UPDATING OF CATALOGUES. AN
UNDERGRADUATE READING ROOM WAS SET UP APART FROM THE MAIN BUILDING IN 1884 AND
EXISTED UNTIL 1929. PROBLEMS ARISING FROM INEFFICIENCY AND A LACK OF SPACE
GAVE RISE TO A MAJOR REORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY'S RESOURCES IN THE 1930S.
AT THE PRESENT TIME NEW ACCESSIONS CURRENTLY RUN TO ABOUT 900 VOLUMES AND 160
PAMPHLETS PER ANNUM. ALL MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THE LIBRARY
WHICH HAS THE BEST STOCK OF RESEARCH MATERIAL IN OXFORD, APART FROM THE
BODLEIAN.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. THE LIBRARIES AT THE UNIVERSITIES OF REGENSBURG,
AUGSBURG, BAYREUTH, BAMBERG AND PASSAU, ALL FOUNDED SINCE 1960, COMPRISE A
BASIC STRUCTURE OF A CENTRAL LIBRARY CONTAINING 2/3 OF STOCK, PLUS SOME
SUBJECT LIBRARIES, CONTAINING THE REMAINING 1/3. TOGETHER THEY OPERATE A UNION
CATALOGUE AND IN THIS THEY HAVE RECENTLY BEEN JOINED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC
UNIVERSITY OF EICHSTATT. THE CATALOGUE, CONTAINING OVER 2 MILLION MAIN
ENTRIES, IS USED IN INTERLIBRARY LOANS, BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK, CATALOGUING, STOCK
SELECTION AND INFORMATION SERVICES. REGENSBURG COORDINATES CLASSIFICATION AND
BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK, AUGSBURG THE USE OF KEYWORDS. GENERAL ORGANISATION AND
WORK PROCESSES COMMON TO ALL ARE DESCRIBED AND THE BASIC LIBRARY BUILDING
STRUCTURE IS ILLUSTRATED WITH REFERENCE TO AUGSBURG.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY' TASKS, STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY, FOUNDED IN 1964, HAS OVER
10,000 STUDENTS STUDYING A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE LIBRARY, STOCKING OVER
A MILLION VOLUMES, COMPRISES A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND 11 SUBJECT LIBRARIES,
EMPLOYING 215 STAFF. ALL STOCK, WHETHER OPEN ACCESS OR IN STACKS, IS
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL UNIVERSITY MEMBERS. THE STOCK CONTAINS A LARGE PROPORTION OF
MODERN MATERIAL; OLDER WORKS ARE BOUGHT ONLY WHEN ESSENTIAL FOR CERTAIN
DISCIPLINES. IN 1980 THE BUDGET FOR BOOK PURCHASE AND BINDING TOTALLED 63
MILLION DM. ALPHABETICAL, KEYWORD AND CLASSIFIED LOCATION CATALOGUES ARE
PROVIDED AND STOCKS ARE ALSO ENTERED IN THE UNION CATALOGUE FOR ALL THE NEW
BAVARIAN UNIVERSITIES. IT IS HOPED THAT STOCKS OF OLDER MATERIAL CAN BE
ENLARGED THROUGH STACK EXPANSION AND THAT INCREASING DEMANDS FOR ALL KINDS OF
MATERIAL CAN BE MET THROUGH FURTHER  INTER-UNIVERSITY COOPERATION.

RESEARCH IN BRITISH ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES OF THE UPPSALA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DURING THE
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.

WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF UPPSALA WAS RE-ESTABLISHED IN THE 1620S BY KING
GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, A WELL-EQUIPPED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT
PRE-REQUISITE. THE LIBRARY WAS MOVED SEVERAL TIMES, AND IN 1638 A PERMANENT
POST OF LIBRARIAN WAS CREATED. THE BOOK COLLECTION WAS ARRANGED BY FACULTY,
AND SYSTEMATIC INDICES WERE PRODUCED. STUDENT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BORROW BOOKS
FOR HOME READING, ALTHOUGH PROFESSORS COULD DO SO, AND PROFESSORS OFTEN STOOD
BAIL FOR THOSE WHO DEFAULTED ON THE RESTRICTIONS. LIBRARIANS WERE CHOSEN FROM
AMONGST THE UNIVERSITY'S MOST RENOWNED PROFESSORS. ULTIMATELY, CONSIDERABLE
CATALOGUING WORK WAS CARRIED OUT, FIXED HOURS WERE ESTABLISHED, AND THE
LIBRARY'S LENDING POLICY BECAME MORE LIBERAL.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP IN PAKISTAN' PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS.

SURVEYS BRIEFLY THE HISTORY OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN PAKISTAN, AND OUTLINES
THE SERVICES CURRENTLY OFFERED BY THESE LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES SOME OF THEIR
COMMON PROBLEMS WHICH INCLUDE' THE SHORTAGE OF FUNDS AND OF SUITABLY QUALIFIED
STAFF; INADEQUATE COLLECTIONS AND FACILITIES; POOR CATALOGUING AND
CLASSIFICATION PRACTICES; AND THE LACK OF INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION. SUGGESTS
WAYS OF OVERCOMING SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS.
THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE.

EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN LATIN AMERICA WHERE THEY
ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO FUNCTION AS NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTRES. THE CURRENT
SITUATION IS REVIEWED IN RELATION TO THE NEED FOR INTEGRATION AND COOPERATION
IN DEVELOPING FUTURE PROGRAMMES, BOTH WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE UNIVERSITY CONTEXT
AND AT THE WIDER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF
ACTIVATING LIBRARY SERVICES TO SERVE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, AND CITES EXAMPLES OF
POLICIES IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. FINALLY EXAMPLES ARE PRESENTED OF LATIN
AMERICAN INITIATIVES IN COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA AND MEXICO.
STOCKPILE OF NEW THINKING ON LIBRARIANSHIP.

DESCRIBES THE LIBRARY OF THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL. THE LIBRARY IS THE
COUNTRY'S MAIN SUBJECT LIBRARY FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND WITH 90,000 VOLUMES AND
1,500 JOURNALS CONTAINS 1 OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF SUCH
LITERATURE. IT EMPLOYS 4 LIBRARIANS AND 4 ASSISTANTS. ITS MAIN PURPOSE IS TO
SERVE THE SCHOOL, BUT EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES ARE TO BE GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY.
THUS 2BIBLIOTEK 701 IS TO PUBLISH INFORMATION BROUGHT TO ITS ATTENTION BY THE
LIBRARY. AN ARCHIVE OF POSTERS, REGULATIONS, PLANS, FILMS, TAPES, DOCUMENTS,
LETTERS AND PICTURES IS PLANNED. A PROJECT JOINTLY WITH OTHER NORDIC LIBRARY
SCHOOLS INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DATA BASE OF NORDIC LITERATURE ON
LIBRARIES, DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION BEGAN IN 1979. ON-LINE SEARCHES ARE
POSSIBLE ON THE LIBRARY'S NEW COMPUTER TERMINAL.

FROM JAN 81 JONSTRUP TEACHER TRAINING COLLEGE HAS HAD A PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY
SERVICE IN CONJUNCTION WITH LYNGBY PUBLIC LIBRARY. A LIBRARIAN FROM THE
LIBRARY HAS BEEN STATIONED AT, AND PAID BY, THE COLLEGE SINCE OCT 80. A
LIBRARY COMMITTEE OF TEACHING STAFF, STUDENTS AND LIBRARIANS WAS SET UP TO
ANALYSE THE COLLEGE'S NEEDS AS REGARDS LIBRARY SERVICES IN GENERAL AND A
PROJECT DUE TO START IN 1981 IN PARTICULAR. IT WAS AGREED THAT A LARGE
CENTRALLY PLACED LIBRARY WAS NEEDED FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS, THAT LYNGBY
LIBRARY WOULD MAKE ABOUT 10% OF ANNUAL ACCESSIONS READY FOR LENDING, AND THAT
LIBRARY STAFF WOULD BE AVAILABLE 4 HOURS DAILY. THE PRESENT STOCK WAS TO BE
EXAMINED FOR POSSIBLE WITHDRAWAL OR RETENTION AND REGISTRATION. EXTRA STAFF
WAS SECURED FOR THE ORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY AND TRANSFER OF MATERIAL FROM
THE SPECIAL SUBJECT AREAS TO THE LIBRARY.

A PORTRAIT OF PETER FREDERIK SUHM, 1728-98, AUTHOR OF A HISTORY OF DENMARK. HE
OPENED HIS PRIVATE LIBRARY IN HIS HOUSE IN CENTRAL COPENHAGEN TO THE PUBLIC
AND PEOPLE FROM ALL SPHERES OF LIFE USED IT. LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THIS LIBRARY
AS CATALOGUES, CORRESPONDENCE, INVOICES AND RECORDS OF BORROWINGS WERE LOST.
ALTHOUGH 1 OF SUHM'S LIBRARIANS, R. NYERUP, WAS A PROLIFIC AUTHOR, HE NEVER
WROTE ABOUT THE LIBRARY. WITH 100,000 VOLUMES, IT WAS LARGER THAN THE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. SUHM SPENT 5 TIMES AS MUCH ON HIS LIBRARY AS THE
GOVERNMENT SPENT ON THE ROYAL LIBRARY, NOT YET OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AND PAID
FOR IT WITH HIS WEALTHY WIFE'S MONEY. 2 YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH THE LIBRARY WAS
SOLD TO THE ROYAL LIBRARY.

FACTORY COMMITTEES ON WHICH BOTH MANAGEMENT AND UNIONS ARE REPRESENTED. THERE
ARE TODAY 500 FACTORY LIBRARIES WITH SPECIALLY APPOINTED STAFF AND 2,000 WITH
UNMANNED BOOK COLLECTIONS. OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF WORKPLACE LIBRARIES,
BEGINNING WITH EUGENE VARLIN'S LIBRARY OPENED IN 1852. FROM 1870-1914,
LIBRARIES BECAME ATTACHED TO THE LABOUR EXCHANGES. THE LARGEST LIBRARY TODAY
IS AT THE RENAULT FACTORY OUTSIDE PARIS, WITH 25,000 EMPLOYEES, OF WHOM 1/3
ARE IMMIGRANTS. THE MODERN HISTORY OF FACTORY LIBRARIES BEGINS HERE, WITH THE
OPENING OF THE MAIN LIBRARY IN 1950 AFTER FACTORY COMMITTEES HAD BEEN
APPOINTED. THE MAIN LIBRARY HAS 60,000 VOLUMES AND EMPLOYS 5 LIBRARIANS.
SOCIOCULTURAL 'ANIMATEURS' SERVE 9 LENDING STATIONS. COMPARES STATISTICS FOR

LIBRARY SERVICES TO PATIENTS IN SCOTTISH HOSPITALS.

SCOTLAND'S 15 HEALTH BOARDS, 41 LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND 2 VOLUNTARY
ORGANISATIONS WERE CIRCULARISED FOR INFORMATION ON LIBRARY SERVICES TO
PATIENTS IN SCOTTISH HOSPITALS. OF THE 41 LOCAL AUTHORITIES, 5 DID NOT REPLY,
AND 7 HAD NO SERVICE, LEAVING 70% OF AUTHORITIES PROVIDING A SERVICE TO 62
HOSPITALS. THIS IS 17&H% OF SCOTLAND'S 348 HOSPITALS. ONLY 2 AUTHORITIES
PROVIDE A FULL-TIME QUALIFIED LIBRARIAN. IN MANY INSTANCES IT IS THE WARD
SISTER WHO ADMINISTERS THE DEPOSIT COLLECTION LEFT BY THE LOCAL LIBRARY.
FURTHER DETAILS OF SERVICES ARE GIVEN, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SERVICES IN
THE CUNNINGHAME DISTRICT, WHICH IS IN RECEIPT OF AN URBAN AID GRANT FOR THE
EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO THE HOUSEBOUND AND TO HOSPITAL PATIENTS. APPENDED IS

THE CONCEPT OF THE 'WORKPLACE' LIBRARY-A SWEDISH ADVANCE-HAS ATTRACTED MUCH
ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. RESULTS, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN OF VARIABLE EQUALITY
AND ONLY IN A FEW LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAS IT BEEN POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE A
FIRMLY ESTABLISHED OPERATION STRONGLY ANCHORED IN THE WORKPLACES. ONE SECTOR
OF THE SWEDISH LABOUR MARKET, HOWEVER, HAS FOR MANY YEARS ENJOYED A SMOOTHLY
FUNCTIONING PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE. THE SWEDISH SEAMEN'S LIBRARY SERVES THE
PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SWEDISH MERCHANT FLEET. BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY ARE TO BE
FOUND ON ALMOST ALL SWEDEN'S MERCHANT SHIPS, ABOVE ALL THOSE ON THE OCEAN

DESCRIBES BAL BAHVAN ('CHILDREN'S HOUSE'), NEW DELHI, A CENTRE OF CREATIVITY
FOR ALL CHILDREN AGED 5-16, REGARDLESS OF CLASS OR CASTE. THE CENTRE, OPENED
IN 1956, IS A GOVERNMENT PROJECT AND SIMILAR CENTRES EXIST IN 15 OTHER STATES;
DELHI ALONE HAS 15 DISTRICT CENTRES. THERE IS A MEMBERSHIP FEE, ALTHOUGH
MATERIALS ARE FREE. 500-1,000 CHILDREN VISIT DAILY. CHILDREN CAN CHOOSE AMONG
SEVERAL ACTIVITY GROUPS. THE LIBRARY HAS 18,000 VOLUMES AND 67 JOURNALS. IT
HAS A CHILDREN'S SECTION AND A REFERENCE COLLECTION FOR TEACHERS. IT ALSO
SERVES THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MUSEUM, WHICH HAS A NEW EXHIBITION EVERY MONTH.

GIVEN OF PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTING DATA ON EQUIPMENT, STOCK, AND ACTIVITIES
FROM SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE RESULTS SHOWED AN EXTREMELY
UNSATISFACTORY SITUATION' THE FEW LIBRARY SERVICES IN EXISTENCE LACKED
RESOURCES OF ALL KINDS AND LARGELY DISPENSED WITH PROFESSIONAL STAFF. URGES
THE NECESSITY OF CREATING ADEQUATE SERVICES WITHOUT DELAY.

ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE PROGRAMME. DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, AND A SUMMARY OF RESULTS PRESENTED, COVERING SUCH
POINTS AS USER ATTITUDES AND SATISFACTION; INTEGRATION WITH SCHOOL CURRICULA;
AND ADEQUACY OF COLLECTIONS, PERSONNEL, AND SERVICES. FROM THESE, IT WAS
CONCLUDED THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES WERE DEFICIENT,
RESULTING IN INADEQUATE LIBRARY INTEGRATION INTO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES;
TRAINING FOR THE LIBRARIANS INVOLVED IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AS A PRIMARY
MEASURE TOWARDS IMPROVING THE PROJECT IF IT IS TO BE USED AS A MODEL FOR
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.

WAY OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES.
THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

IFLA CHALLENGES TO ACTION IN THE YEAR OF THE DISABLED.

THE 46TH IFLA CONFERENCE (MANILA, AUG 80), THE 1ST HELD IN A DEVELOPING
COUNTRY, AROUSED UNUSUAL INTEREST AMONG FILIPINO LIBRARIANS AND MEDIA. IFLA'S
OBJECTIVES OF EXTENDING INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING, COOPERATION, DEBATE,
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ALL FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, CURRENTLY THROUGH ITS
PROGRAMMES UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS WAS EMPHASISED. ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR A
COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
RESTING WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE THE YEAR OF THE CHILD MUST BE FOLLOWED UP
ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE YEAR OF THE DISABLED IS A REMINDER
THAT HANDICAPPED PEOPLE IN ALL COUNTRIES LACK EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER
READING GROUPS. WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES MUST NOT INHIBIT THE SEARCH
FOR NEW IDEAS. CHALLENGES ALL LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS TO FOCUS ATTENTION IN 1981
PARTICULARLY ON THE LIBRARY NEED OF BLIND AND OTHER HANDICAPPED READERS.
A CLEARING HOUSE FOR LIBRARY LITERATURE-PAST EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE
POSSIBILITIES.

SOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT HELP TO TRANSFER AND MAKE AVAILABLE THE SURPLUS OF
PRODUCTS IN 1 GEOGRAPHIC AREA TO ANOTHER IN WHICH SUCH PRODUCTS ARE IN SHORT
SUPPLY. AREAS ADDRESSED INCLUDE (1) HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, (2) PROFESSIONAL
ORGANISATIONS, (3) THE PAUCITY OF AUTHORS, (4) PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILTIES,
(5) EDITORS' REQUIREMENTS, (6) UNWANTED ARTICLES, (7) THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD'S

HISTORY OF THE LIBRARIES OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY.

PROMINENT SCIENTIST IN THE FIELD OF POWER ENGINEERING, YU.N. FLAKSERMAN WORKED
IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. BASED ON A DISCUSSION WITH HIM, REVIEWS HIS WORK FOR THE
COUNCIL, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
FOREIGN LITERATURE READING ROOM OF THE STATE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY.
WE, TOO, MUST BECOME 'GATEKEEPERS'-OF INFORMATION.I

F LIBRARIANSHIP IS TO BE REFORMED, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONVINCE THOSE WHO RUN
LIBRARIES, OR HAVE AUTHORITY OVER LIBRARIANS, THAT PEOPLE OF A SCIENTIFIC OR
TECHNICAL BENT HAVE AN IMPORTANT AND RIGHTFUL PLACE IN LIBRARIES. (THE ARTICLE
IS A RESPONSE TO JOHN SHARP'S ARTICLE IN LIBR. ASS. REC. 83 (4) APR 81,
192-193. SEE) CONTENDS THAT IF LIBRARIANS, (BOTH ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC), ADOPT
THE CORRECT PHILOSOPHY THEY WILL FIND A PLACE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE
MICROELECTRONICS REVOLUTION.
THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IN MALAYSIA: SUMMARY OF A DISSERTATION.

SUMMARY OF AN MA THESIS SUBMITTED TO THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY, ARCHIVE AND
INFORMATION STUDIES, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON, DEC 75. 150 MALAYSIAN
LIBRARIANS WERE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE MAIN FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER AND THEIR OPINIONS ON THE PROFESSION IN
RELATION TO TRAINING AND EDUCATION. 77 RESPONDED. 58 WERE 24-37 YEARS OLD; 59
WERE FEMALE; 68 HAD A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; 49 CHOSE LIBRARIANSHIP AFTER THEY
FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY; MOST LANDED IN THE PROFESSION BY ACCIDENT; ALL
FAVOURED FURTHER PROFESSIONAL TRAINING (MOST PREFERRED TO GO ABROAD TO GAIN
WIDER EXPERIENCE AND ADSORB NEW IDEAS); 23 WOULD ADVISE THEIR CHILDREN TO BE
LIBRARIANS; 29 HAD PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS WHEN 1ST APPOINTED; 47 HAD
WORKED ONLY IN THEIR PRESENT LIBRARIES; AND MOST LIKED THEIR LIBRARIES BUT
EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH SALARY AND PROMOTION PROSPECTS.
FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CODE.
THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE.

THE EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF 'THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE' ARE REVIEWED AND
SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF THE SUBJECT OF A SCIENTIFIC
DISCIPLINE ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCES
CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 'THE LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND
RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS', AND THE SUBJECT OF SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP AS 'THE
LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS
IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES'. BELIEVES THAT 'SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP' IS NOT AN
INDEPENDENT DISCIPLINE AND ARGUES THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE DISCIPLINE CALLED
'LIBRARY SCIENCE' AND THAT THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP
APPLY TO ALL LIBRARIES.
FACTS AND FACTUAL INFORMATION AND THEIR ROLE IN INFORMATICS.

INVESTIGATES VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONCEPT 'FACT'. DEFINES FACT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARXIST THEORY AS AN ELEMENT OF OBJECTIVE REALITY. FACT IN
INFORMATICS IS A PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE WHOSE OBJECTIVE VERITY HAS BEEN
SUFFICIENTLY PROVED. FACTUAL INFORMATION AS A PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE, INVESTIGATED
IN THEORY AND PROVED IN PRACTICE, CANNOT BE CHALLENGED; IT CAN, HOWEVER, HAVE
VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS. THE INFLUENCE OF FACTS AND FACTUAL INFORMATION ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATICS AS A SCIENTIFIC BRANCH BY MEANS OF THE FORMULATION
OF HYPOTHESES, THEORIES AND SCIENTIFIC THEORIES IS DISCUSSED.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN-A JOB OR A PROFESSION?.

EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANSHIP AS A PROFESSION. THE
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH CHILDREN; TO INVOLVE
HIM/HERSELF CONTINUALLY WITH CHILDREN, THEIR MATERIALS AND IDEAS; TO PLAN FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES; AND TO BE AWARE OF HIS/HER RESPONSIBILITIES TO
TOMORROW'S ADULTS.
THE CANDIDATES RESPOND.

PRESENTS RESPONSES TO 5 QUESTIONS BY THE NOMINEES FOR ALA PRESIDENT, CAROL A.
NEMEYER AND NORMAN HORROCKS. QUESTIONS RELATE TO: PROBLEMS WITH THE ALA; THE
MAJOR BARRIERS TO CITIZEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES; ATTITUDES TO

WHITHER SAILIS? THOUGHTS ON THE ROLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION.

THE FOUNDING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE (SAILIS) AS A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FAVOURABLY
RECEIVED NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. ITS STRUCTURE WILL BE DEVELOPED IN
THE COMING YEARS TO FOLLOW EFFECTIVELY THE 2 BASIC PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN DURING
ITS PLANNING: THAT THE ENTIRE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSION BE CATERED
FOR BY A CENTRAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION, AND THAT PROVISION BE MADE FOR
FULL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS AND REALISATION OF ASPIRATIONS OF EVERY GROUP IN
THE PROFESSION. HOPES THAT SAILIS WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A NATIONAL LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION NETWORK AND CALLS FOR A PENETRATING ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE
AND SCOPE OF NATIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTIONS.
TRAINING LIBRARIANS FOR THE 80S.

TEXT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND, AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, N. IRELAND BRANCH, HELD
IN BLARNEY, COUNTY CORK IN MAY 80. EXAMINES SOME LIKELY AREAS OF CONCERN OF
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE 1980S, INCLUDING: THE NEED FOR
MORE TRAINING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY; THE INCREASING
IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION SKILLS, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH
COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; AND THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED ARTS OF BOOK SELECTION. ARGUES THAT
THE PRESENT UK ONE YEAR POST GRADUATE COURSE FOR LIBRARIANS IS NOT LONG
ENOUGH, AND STRESSES THE NEED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION WITHIN THE PROFESSION.
LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.
LIBRARY EDUCATION IN ISRAEL.

DESCRIBES THE HISTORY OF LIBRARY EDUCATION IN ISRAEL, AS OBSERVED AND RECORDED

IN UGANDA.
CURRICULUM CHANGE IN THE 80S-TIME FOR SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS.

A BRITISH LIBRARY-FUNDED CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BEGUN IN 1978, IS NOW
IN ITS FINAL STAGES. IT HAS ASSUMED THAT NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO CONSIDER
CHANGE, THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS NEEDED IN THE STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF
PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY EDUCATION IN THE UK, AND THAT ULTIMATELY IT IS LIBRARY
SCHOOL STAFFS WHO WILL DECIDE WHAT CHANGES TO MAKE, AND WHEN. DISCUSSES SOME
OF THE QUESTIONS CONSIDERED OF INTEREST IN THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT'S FINDINGS, AND WHICH WILL INDICATE THE SCOPE OF A LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
LIBRARY EDUCATION GROUP MEETING TO BE HELD IN SEPT 81 TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT
AND ITS IMPLICATIONS.

ACADEMIC, SCHOOL, AND SPECIAL LIBRARIANS, SOLICITING THEIR RESPONSES TO THE
RELATIVE MERITS OF (1) A 1-YEAR VERSUS EXTENDED MASTER'S PROGRAMME IN LIBRARY
SCIENCE AND (2) A 1-YEAR MASTER'S IN LIBRARY SCIENCE WITH AND WITHOUT A 2ND
MASTER'S IN ANOTHER SUBJECT. THE RESPONSES INDICATED THAT RESPONDENTS WERE
SPEAKING IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN IN TERMS
OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND NEEDS IN LIBRARIES. THE SURVEY RESULTS ARE THUS
BEST DESCRIBED AS USEFUL BUT INCONCLUSIVE.
THE FUTURE OF THE ARCHIVE PROFESSION IN QUEBEC: TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
RESEARCH.

THE ARCHIVE PROFESSION IN QUEBEC CURRENTLY FACES A STATE OF CRISIS BECAUSE OF
LACK OF FINANCE, PERSONNEL, AND PROVISION FOR TRAINING. TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH
THE NECESSITY FOR AND THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COURSE IN ARCHIVE
STUDIES, PARALLELS ARE DRAWN WITH DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL, SHOWING THE
SIMILARITIES OF THE TASKS INVOLVED AND THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE 2 FIELDS OF
OPERATION. A PROGRAMME OF STUDIES WHICH WOULD SERVE FOR BOTH IS OUTLINED. THE
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE URGED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ARCHIVE TRAINING,
AND RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE A SECURE FUTURE FOR PRIVATE
AND PUBLIC ARCHIVES IN THE PROVINCE.

THE ART LIBRARY SCENE IN EGYPT.

ART LIBRARIES IN EGYPT, AS PART OF A BROADER ART INFORMATION CONTEXT, DO NOT
PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE PRESERVATION, SURVEY, AND DISSEMINATION OF ART

AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
MEASURING LIBRARY SERVICES-TO CUT COSTS?.

DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF MEASURING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES,
PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO INTRODUCE A
PROCESS WHEREBY LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT ITS COSTS AND
PERFORMANCE TO THE PUBLIC, WITH THE RESULT THAT EXPENDITURE BY LOCAL
AUTHORITIES IS REDUCED TO THE LOWEST SPENDING AUTHORITY'S LEVEL, AND NOT TO
THE LEVEL OF THE AUTHORITY PROVIDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY SERVICES. MEASURES
SHOULD REFLECT THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF THE SERVICES OFFERED, AND LIBRARIAN'S
ATTEMPTS TO AUDIT THEIR WORK WILL IMPROVE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY ARE
TRYING TO DO FOR SOCIETY.
DO LIBRARIANS CARE FOR THEIR PAST?.

A SURVEY OF ALL 166 PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITIES IN THE UK WAS CARRIED OUT TO
DETERMINE WHETHER LIBRARIANS TAKE AS MUCH CARE IN PRESERVING THE
CORRESPONDENCE, MEMORANDA, PLANS, MINUTES AND OTHER RECORDS OF THE PAST, AS
THEY DO IN PRESERVING INFORMATION ABOUT ALL SORTS OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS. IN
MANY CASES THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A LACK OF CLEARLY THOUGHT-OUT POLICIES.
REVIEWS THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE ON CURRENT PROBLEMS THE NEED FOR A USABLE FUND OF SOURCE MATERIAL
IS INESCAPABLE.
STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES: REACTIONS TO A REPORT (3).

PARTS 1 AND 2 OF THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN SAMENLEVING 9 (2) FEB
81, 46-51 AND 9 (3) MAR 81, 80-85 RESPECTIVELY. THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WHICH WERE PUBLISHED RECENTLY IN THE NETHERLANDS BY THE
NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND
LITERATURE), HAS AROUSED MUCH OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE REPORT
WAS SUBMITTED BY THE NBLC TO THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONLY 20%
OF PUBLIC LIBRARY FINANCE. THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE REMAINING 80%, WILL BE REQUIRED TO RAISE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FROM LOCAL
TAXATION TO MEET THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS.
RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES: A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE
RECENTLY BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE KOMMISSIE KOORDINATIE NORMERING. THE COMMITTEE
WAS FORMED IN 1977 TO CONSOLIDATE AND EXPAND THE STANDARDS PROPOSED AT THE
MEETING OF THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR
LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) IN MAR OF THAT YEAR. THE COMITTEE HAS BEEN
CRITICISED FOR THE OMISSION OF A THEORETICAL BASIS TO THE REPORT. HOWEVER, AS
THESE ARE THE FIRST STANDARDS TO BE PUBLISHED, THE COMMITTEE HOPES THAT THEY
WILL FORM THE THEORETICAL BASIS IN FUTURE DISCUSSIONS. IT ALSO INTENDS TO
INCORPORATE THE CRITICISM LEVELLED AT THE REPORT IN A FUTURE REVISION.
INSTITUTION BUILDING FOR LIBRARY SERVICES DEVELOPMENT IN TAIWAN.

ALTHOUGH TAIWAN'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING, THE LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED
FOR DECADES AND THIS NEGLECT COULD HARM THE ECONOMIC GROWTH. SUGGESTS THAT THE
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION SET UP AN OFFICE OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO BRING ABOUT
REFORMS.
DURHAM MOBILEMEET.

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE 1ST MOBILEMEET TO BE HELD IN THE NORTH-EAST OF
ENGLAND, 6 SEPT 80, ST. MARY'S COLLEGE, DURHAM. 79 PEOPLE WITH 12 VEHICLES
ATTENDED TO HEAR SPEECHES BY ANNE BETTISON, JUDITH BOWEN, STAN DEEM AND DAVID
GREAVES ON MOBILE LIBRARIES.
THE AIMS OF MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES.

DURING THE LAST 13 YEARS OF THE 20 YEARS' EXISTENCE OF MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE
IN FINLAND THIS SERVICE HAS BECOME OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE. THERE IS A
MOBILE LIBRARY STANDARD AND THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS SET UP A
MOBILE LIBRARY WORKING GROUP. TRAINING OF DRIVERS HAS BEEN NEGLECTED ALTHOUGH
THEY DEAL WITH THE BULK OF THE LOANS. THE MOBILES, UNTIL THE INTRODUCTION OF
THE STANDARD, WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND WASTEFUL IN ENERGY, AND HAD A SHORT LIFE.
THIS YEAR 4.5 MILLION F MARKS WILL BE SPENT ON NEW MOBILES BY ABOUT 12 LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. 40 AUTHORITIES HAVE APPLIED FOR A GRANT. THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF
A MOBILE SERVICE NEED DEVELOPING: IMPROVED SERVICES AND THEIR RATIONALISATION,
TRAINING OF DRIVERS, COOPERATIVE PURCHASE OF MOBILES BY 2 OR MORE AUTHORITIES.
SETTING UP OF A MUSIC SECTION: NOTES ON WORKING PROCESSES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES
IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

THE 3RD PART OF THE STUDY DEALING WITH THE SETTING UP OF A MUSIC SECTION IN A
PUBLIC LIBRARY IS ENTITLED 'INTER-DISCIPLINARY TEAM'. PARTS 1, 2 AND 4
APPEARED IN CTENAR 32 (11) (12) AND 33 (3) . THE TASKS CONCERNING A MUSIC
SECTION CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 4 AREAS: LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SPHERE,
MUSICOLOGICAL SPHERE, PEDAGOGICAL SPHERE AND TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC SPHERE. A
SPECIALIST WORKS IN EACH OF THEM AND THEY ALL COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER.
DECISIONS CONCERNING THE FINAL SYNTHESIS ARE MADE BY THE MANAGER-LIBRARIAN.
THE COMPETENCE OF THE ADVISERS-SPECIALISTS AND THE LIMITS TO WHICH THE
LIBRARIAN SHOULD LET THEM INTERFERE WITH HIS JOB ARE DISCUSSED IN GREATER
DETAIL.
COUNTY LIBRARIES' REGIONAL SERVICE-PROBLEMS AND LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STAGNATION, PARTLY DUE
TO ECONOMIC FACTORS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN SEVERAL AREAS.
DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION, AND A
RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME, NOW OVER 10 YEARS OLD, IS ATTEMPTING TO APPORTION
FUNCTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. COUNTY LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR TRIPLE TASK OF ADVISORY SERVICE,
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING, AND MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE, ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE. THESE SERVICES, WHICH BENEFIT PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIES
AND INDIVIDUAL READERS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SOME RATIONALISATION
PROPOSALS. THE FIRST 2 COULD BE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED IF COUNTY LIBRARIES
WERE MADE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ATTACHED TO LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. MOBILE
SERVICES ARE POORLY DEVELOPED IN NORWAY, PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS ARE
GEOGRAPHICALLY SUITABLE. A RESTRUCTURING OF TH E COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND COUNTY LIBRARIANS MUST EVALUATE THEIR OWN POSITION AND
SERVICES.
BRIDGES TO THE FUTURE: LIBRARY SERVICE IN MADISON COUNTY, IOWA.

A BROAD BACK AND A TERRIER'S HEAD: AN INTERVIEW WITH THE HEAD OF A LOCAL
VOLUNTARY LIBRARY.

IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONNICKENDAM IN THE NETHERLANDS A PUBLIC LIBRARY RUN
ENTIRELY BY UNPAID VOLUNTEERS WAS FOUNDED IN 1973. THE COLLECTION WAS STARTED
WITH THE PURCHASE OF A BANKRUPT STOCK OF BOOKS AT MINIMAL COST AND IS
PRESENTLY HOUSED IN A FORMER SCHOOL. IT NOW TOTALS 14,500 VOLUMES AND LOANS
HAVE RISEN FROM 10,163 IN 1973 TO 60,368 IN 1980. THE LIBRARY HAS SEPARATE
ADULT AND CHILDREN'S SECTIONS AND STAFF MAKE REGULAR VISITS TO LOCAL SCHOOLS.
IT HAS CLOSE LINKS WITH THE TOWN LIBRARY WITH WHICH IT IS PLANNED TO MERGE
FORMALLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. MRS VAN DRIEL, HEAD OF THE LIBRARY, RECOGNISES
THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF HER VOLUNTARY ASSISTANTS, ADDING THAT THE
ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION OF A VOLUNTEER IS 'A BROAD BACK AND THE HEAD OF A
TERRIER'.

IN THE AREA. STAFF INCLUDE: 1 LIBRARIAN; 1 ADVICE WORKER; 1 LITERACY WORKER;
AND 2 DRIVERS/ASSISTANTS.
THE LIBRARY IN HIGHER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION: AN EDUCATIONAL APPROACH.

IN 1972 A SURVEY OF LIBRARIES IN COLLEGES OF HIGHER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IN
THE NETHERLANDS REVEALED A LOW STANDARD OF LIBRARY PROVISION. AS A RESULT THE
STATE LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS PUBLISHED A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS FOR THE
IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES. MODERN TRENDS IN HIGHER EDUCATION, SUCH AS INCREASED
STUDENT NUMBERS AND NEW METHODS IN TEACHING, HAVE HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE
COLLEGES OF HIGHER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. LIBRARIES OF THESE COLLEGES MUST
NOW BECOME INFORMATION CENTRES, EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS AND EQUIPPED
WITH ADEQUATE CATALOGUES. COLLEGE LIBRARIANS WILL NEED TO PAY INCREASING
ATTENTION TO THE ACQUISITION OF REPORTS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS AND
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS AND SHOULD PROVIDE COURSES OF FORMAL INSTRUCTION FOR
STAFF AND STUDENTS IN THE USE OF LIBRARY SERVICES.

BERNE MUNICIPAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY: EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT 1980.

LOANS HAVE INCREASED BY ALMOST 15% DURING THE YEAR. SCHOOL CHILDREN NOW
COMPRISE 1/3 OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF USERS. IN SPITE OF A LARGER BOOK FUND,
FEWER PURCHASES THAN LAST YEAR WERE MADE BUT STAFF ARE CATCHING UP ON THE
CATALOGUING BACKLOG. SHORTAGE OF SPACE IS A PROBLEM; THE LIBRARY MUST PLAY A
KEY ROLE IN UNIVERSITY PLANNING. BECAUSE OF PROCESSING, STORAGE AND RUNNING
COSTS, EACH BOOK COSTS MORE THAN ITS PURCHASING PRICE; THE USE OF ELECTRONIC
DATA PROCESSING WILL NOT SAVE MUCH MONEY BUT WILL IMPROVE SERVICES. WORK IS
PROCEEDING ON THE BUHLPLATZ FACULTY LIBRARY, TO BE OPENED IN AUTUMN 81, WHERE
BIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MATERIAL FROM VARIOUS INSTITUTE LIBRARIES WILL BE
AMALGAMATED.
GENERAL STATISTICAL SURVEY OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES (ESGBU). SUMMARY OF 1977
FIGURES.

COMPILED BY DATA SENT BY 44 FRENCH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THE RESULTS ARE
PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORM, WITH NOTES. POINTS COVERED ARE: USERS, HOLDINGS,
LOANS, STAFF, RESOURCES AND EXPENDITURE.
LIBRARIES AND THE ORGANIZATION OF UNIVERSITIES IN FRANCE, 1789-1881.

EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF PROMOTING LIBRARIES AND THE
PROMOTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION CONVERGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRENCH
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THE REVOLUTION OF 1789 ABOLISHED
UNIVERSITIES AND CONFISCATED THEIR LIBRARIES. THE IMPERIAL UNIVERSITY, AN
EDUCATIONAL BUREAUCRACY THAT SURVIVED THE EMPIRE AND ENDURED FOR MOST OF THE
19TH CENTURY, DID NOT PROMOTE RESEARCH OR REQUIRE RESEARCH LIBRARIES. HOWEVER,
IN 1855 EFFORTS BEGAN TO REPLACE THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM WITH AUTONOMOUS
UNIVERSITIES, AND THESE EFFORTS FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
IN 1881 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WERE CREATED IN THE PROVINCES AS A 1ST STEP
TOWARD CREATING UNIVERSITIES, 15 YEARS BEFORE THE DE JURE ESTABLISHMENT OF
UNIVERSITIES.
HELSINKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

HELSINKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS 6 DEPARTMENTS: THE NATIONAL LIBRARY; THE
HUMANITIES LIBRARY; THE SLAVIC COLLECTION; THE STUDENTS' LIBRARY; THE NATURAL
SCIENCE LIBRARY; AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT. IT IS ONE OF THE 160
LIBRARIES BELONGING TO THE UNIVERSITY. SOME OF THE OTHERS ARE THE CENTRAL
AGRICULTURAL, THE CENTRAL FORESTRY, AND THE CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY. THE
SLAVIC COLLECTION CONTAINS RUSSIAN BOOKS OBTAINED BY LEGAL DEPOSIT BETWEEN
1828 AND 1917. IT IS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF ITS KIND IN THE WEST. SOVIET
LITERATURE IS ADDED TO THE COLLECTION REGULARLY. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT
RECEIVES 5 COPIES OF ALL BOOKS PUBLISHED IN FINLAND EVERY 6 MONTHS. THIS
AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 10,000 NEW ENTRIES EACH YEAR. FROM 1981 THE LEGAL DEPOSIT
WILL BE 6 COPIES RECEIVED 4 TIMES A YEAR, AND AV-MATERIALS WILL BE INCLUDED.
THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IS BEING COMPUTERISED.
THE 1ST ACADEMIC LIBRARY OF SIBERIA (THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARY OF THE TOMSK UNIVERSITY).

REVIEWS THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT AND DISCUSSES THE CURRENT WORK OF THE
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY OF TOMSK UNIVERSITY. WHEN FOUNDED, IN 1880, THE LIBRARY HAD
A STOCK OF APPROXIMATELY 96,000 ITEMS CONSISTING OF VALUABLE COLLECTIONS OF
BOOKS, WHICH WERE EITHER PURCHASED OR WHICH THE LIBRARY RECEIVED AS GIFTS.
INITIALLY THE USE WAS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE: DURING ITS FIRST 10 YEARS THE
LIBRARY HANDLED ON AVERAGE ONLY 5,000 LOANS PER YEAR. STAFF WORKED UNDER
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1941-44 WHEN A HERBARIUM AND
A MUSEUM WERE MOVED INTO ITS PREMISES. IN ADDITION, DURING THAT PERIOD THE
LIBRARY LOOKED AFTER THE ARCHIVES OF A.M. GOR'KII, L.N. TOLSTOI AND A.S.
PUSHKIN. DESPITE THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS, STAFF NOT ONLY MANAGED TO CONTINUE
THEIR WORK BUT THE LIBRARY ALSO PROVIDED A SERVICE TO WOUNDED SOLDIERS
RECEIVING TREATMENT IN TOMSK. THE LIBRARY HAS CURRENTLY A STOCK OF 3, 5
MILLION ITEMS IN MORE THAN 50 LANGUAGES AND AN EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF
PERIODICALS. IN 1969 THE LIBRARY BECAME A METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR 46
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. IT ORGANISES OVER 300 BOOK EXHIBITIONS A YEAR.
THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ZURICH-IRCHEL UNIVERSITY.

THE LIBRARY WAS FOUNDED IN 1974, THE NEW BUILDING OPENING IN 1980. THE
LIBRARY'S MAIN TASK IS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS, MAINLY OF PHILOSOPHY AND
PRE-CLINICAL MEDICINE, WITH A WIDE RANGE OF TEXTBOOKS, REFERENCE WORKS AND
BASIC LITERATURE IN THEIR OWN SUBJECTS AND AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LITERATURE
OF OTHER DISCIPLINES. THE LIBRARY COOPERATES ACTIVELY WITH OTHER LIBRARIES,
ORGANISING THE PRODUCTION OF A UNION CATALOGUE WITH OTHER UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE
LIBRARIES AND PARTICIPATING IN THE DIRECT ORDERING AND SUPPLY SERVICE OF THE
NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. LIBRARY STOCKS NOW TOTAL 4,000 BOOKS
AND 300 CURRENT PERIODICALS. THE DOBIS/LIBIS ON-LINE SYSTEM IS USED IN THE
SEARCH FOR AND INPUT OF INFORMATION, ACCESSIONS, CATALOGUING AND LOANS. THE
LIBRARY'S MOST URGENT TASKS ARE EXPANSION OF STOCK AND COMPLETION OF THE UNION
CATALOGUE.
KING FAISAL UNIVERSITY: EXTENSIVE LIBRARY NETWORK SET TO GROW FURTHER.

THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF KING FAISAL UNIVERSITY, SAUDI ARABIA, IS RAPIDLY
EXPANDING TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS. AMONGST THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE THE PROPOSED
OPENING, DURING THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR, OF A CENTRE FOR TRANSLATION AND
PUBLICATION, CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH TRANSLATION OF BOOKS INTO AND FROM
ARABIC.
SECTION ON THE UNIVERSITY OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY LIBRARY).E

XTRACT FROM A PROPOSAL TO THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT FOR SUPPORT AND
RECOGNITION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY, WHICH, FOLLOWING THE
LYNCH COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS, IT HAS REFUSED TO FUND IN THE NEXT
TRIENNIUM (1982-84). DESCRIBES THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY IN
TERMS OF A LIBRARY COLLECTION, LIBRARY STAFF, THE LIBRARY BUILDING, RESOURCE
SHARING, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES.
LIBRARIES IN COLLEGES OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

A DECLINE IN THE UK BIRTH RATE, THE ASSUMPTION THAT FEW TEACHERS WOULD BE
NEEDED AND AN ATTEMPT TO BROADEN THE BASE OF EDUCATION HAVE LED TO THE
APPEARANCE OF COLLEGES AND INSTITUTES OF HIGHER EDUCATION, FORMED AS MANY
COLLEGES OF EDUCATION CLOSED AND OTHERS MERGED WITH POLYTECHNICS AND OTHER
INSTITUTIONS. THE LIBRARIES ARE AS VARIED AS THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES, AND A
LACK OF PUBLISHED STANDARDS MAKES LIBRARY PLANNING DIFFICULT. WITH STAFF
DOUBLED OR TREBLED BY AMALGAMATIONS THERE IS A PARAMOUNT NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL
STAFF TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF STAFF AND RESOURCES.
THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATING A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THE COUNTRY'S
WORKFORCE IN THE CHES IS ENORMOUS.
LIBRARY SERVICES AT THE ROYAL NAVAL COLLEGE, GREENWICH.

THE ROYAL NAVAL COLLEGE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1873 AND IS NOW CLASSED AS A
NATIONAL TREASURE UNDER THE ANCIENT MONUMENTS ACT AND MAINTAINED JOINTLY BY
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE LIBRARY
CONTAINS SOME 34,000 BOOKS AND 120 CURRENT PERIODICALS INCLUDING MANY NAVAL
HISTORIES. THE COLLEGE OFFERS COURSES TO THE ARMED SERVICES, AND HOUSES THE
DEPARTMENT OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY. THE LIBRARY SERVICES PLAY A VITAL
ROLE IN HELPING FULFIL THE AIMS AS LAID DOWN BY THE ADMIRALTY IN 1873,
INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF HIGHER EDUCATION OF
NAVAL OFFICERS.

PAPER PRESENTED TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE LAA SPECIAL LIBRARIES
SECTION, QUEENSLAND GROUP, 19 NOV 80. OUTLINES THE CHANGES TO THE COPYRIGHT
ACT WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COPYING OF BOOKS OR PERIODICALS. SECTIONS
INCLUDE: WHAT IS COPYRIGHT? WHAT COPYING DOES THE ACT PERMIT? COPYING BY

AND PENALTIES. SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF PHOTOCOPYING DOCUMENTATION FROM THE
SOUTH-EAST QUEENSLAND ELECTRICITY BOARD, BRISBANE, ARE APPENDED.
COPYRIGHT AMENDEMENT ACT 1980-REPORT BY QUEENSLAND GROUP'S SUB-COMMITTEE.

IN NOV 80, THE QUEENSLAND GROUP OF THE AUSTRALIAN SPECIAL LIBRARIES SECTION
HELD A SERIES OF MEETINGS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT ACT ON
SPECIAL LIBRARIES. A SUB-COMMITTEE WAS FORMED TO REPORT AND RECOMMEND ON THE
ACT. PRESENTS THE SUB-COMMITTEE'S REPORT. ITS CONCLUSIONS INCLUDE THE
FOLLOWING: RECENT AMENDS TO THE ACT WILL SERIOUSLY DISADVANTAGE THE CLIENTS OF
AUSTRALIA'S SPECIAL LIBRARIES; INORDINATE DELAYS MAY BE PLACED ON SUPPLY OF
INFORMATION TO CLIENTS; AND THE ACT PLACES NO RESTRICTION ON THE COPYRIGHT
OWNER OR HIS AGENT REGARDING MAINTENANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION
GAINED FROM THE INSPECTION OF DECLARATIONS.

FINAL CHAPTER ON THE SERVICES OFFERED BY KENT COUNTY LIBRARY.
LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGED: NOT QUITE WHAT THEY SEEM.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, BATH 1980.
DISCUSSES THE STANDARD OF THE PROVISION MADE BY UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES FOR THE
DISADVANTAGED, AND ARGUES THAT, WHILST LIBRARIES HAVE LARGELY RESPONDED TO THE
NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTIONALLY DISADVANTAGED (EG HOSPITAL PATIENTS, THE
HANDICAPPED, AND PRISON INMATES), THE SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED
HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED. IDENTIFIES A BASIC DICHOTOMY WHICH HAS 2 ASPECTS:
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN LEVELS OF PROVISION FOR VARIOUS DISADVANTAGED GROUPS;
AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN SERVICE TO THE DISADVANTAGED AND SERVICE TO THE
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. REPORTS CRITICISMS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE INADEQUACY
OF THE WORK DONE BY LIBRARIES WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES, IN DEPRIVED AREAS, AND
WITH RELATION TO FUNCTIONAL LITERACY AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF READING.
STRESSES THE NEED FOR THE PROVISION OF COURSES ON, AND THE INITIATION OF
RESEARCH INTO, LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISADVANTAGED.
HURDLING HANDICAPS-SERVICES IN SPITE OF DWINDLING FUNDS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE, NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL
UNIVERSITY, NOV 80. DISCUSSES 2 THEMES OF THE PAST DECADE-THE FINANCIAL
HANDICAPS SUFFERED BY LIBRARY MANAGERS, AND THE INCREASINGLY EFFECTIVE AND
WIDESPREAD ADDITION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR CITIZENS WITH HANDICAPS.
CAN THE LEAN YEARS GIVE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES NEW OPPORTUNITIES?.

THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY'S MAIN TASKS REMAIN THOSE OF A CENTURY AGO:- TO
ENCOURAGE APTITUDES AND SKILLS, TO DISSEMINATE KNOWLEDGE, BOTH THROUGH FICTION
AND FACTUAL BOOKS, TO PROVIDE EXPERIENCE, WHETHER FROM INFORMATIVE
NON-FICTION, SATISFYING THE CHILD'S CURIOSITY, OR FROM FICTION, ALLOWING FOR
EMOTIONAL IDENTIFICATION, TO EDUCATE, ESPECIALLY IDEOLOGICALLY. SOME NORWEGIAN
COMMUNITIES STILL MAINTAIN STRICT ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS BOOK SELECTION
STANDARDS; LIBRARIANS MUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR OWN SELECTION CRITERIA.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST PUBLICISE THEIR WORK AND PROBLEMS, COOPERATING
WHERE POSSIBLE WITH THE MASS MEDIA, AND MAKE THE 1980S A DECADE OF
OPPORTUNITY.
ROLE OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN INDIA.

DESCRIBES THE PRESENT CONDITION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES IN INDIA; EXPLAINS THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE CORRECT USE OF BOOKS; DISCUSSES THE PLIGHT OF TEENAGERS, FOR
WHOM THERE ARE NO SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND ACCESS TO ADULT LIBRARIES IS OFTEN
FORBIDDEN; STRESSES THE SPECIAL QUALITIES OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS; POINTS OUT
THE DIFFICULTIES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF STAFF AND IMPROPER CONDITIONS; AND
SUGGESTS REGULAR SEMINARS, MEETINGS, AND WORKSHOPS INVOLVING PARENTS,
TEACHERS, LIBRARIANS, AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS, AND ILLUSTRATORS.
LIBRARIES FOR CHILDREN.

DESCRIBES HOW THE WORLD HAS COME TO REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILD FOR
THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY ALONG APPROPRIATE LINES AND THE IMPORTANT
ROLE OF EDUCATION, INCLUDING PROVISION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES. TRACES THE
GROWTH OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES IN INDIA AND PROMOTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
IN THE INDIAN LANGUAGES; MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR THE WRITING AND PRODUCTION OF
BETTER CHILDREN'S BOOKS; MENTIONS THE TRAINING OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS; AND
SUGGESTS STEPS FOR CREATING A NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN INDIA FOR THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES AT ALL LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
A SURVEY OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES IN OHIO PUBLIC LIBRARIES 1979.

SURVEY CARRIED OUT BY THE OHIO LIBRARY ASSOCIATION SERVICE TO CHILDREN AND
YOUNG TEENS DIVISION. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO LIBRARIES WITH NO LISTED
BRANCHES, CHILDREN'S SERVICE COORDINATORS, BRANCH LIBRARIES, AND PUBLIC
LIBRARIES OFFERING A BOOKMOBILE SERVICE. RESULTS WERE ANALYSED AND SUMMARISED
UNDER 5 HEADINGS: CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND ADMINISTRATION; STAFF; MATERIALS;
PROGRAMMES AND PRACTICES; AND SERVICES BEYOND THE LIBRARY.
SCHOOL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRES. OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCES.

A GROUP OF 3 ARTICLES, WHICH ORIGINALLY APPEARED SEPARATELY IN 1978 AND 1979
IN BIBLIOTHEQUES CENTRES DOCUMENTAIRES, A FRENCH PERIODICAL, DESCRIBING THE
INTEGRATION OF NEW LIBRARIES INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FRENCH SCHOOLS, FROM
SEVERAL VIEWPOINTS. IN THE 1ST ARTICLE, 2 PARENTS RECOUNT HOW THE LIBRARY WAS
SET UP, DEVELOPED FUNCTIONS AND ACTIVITIES, AND WAS RECEIVED BY TEACHERS AND
PUPILS. THE 2ND ARTICLE GIVES 2 CONTRASTING ACCOUNTS BY TEACHERS: THE 1ST
SHOWS HOW AFTER INITIAL HESITATION, THE LIBRARY AND SCHOOL FOUND HOW TO ADAPT
TO AND COMPLEMENT EACH OTHERS' ACTIVITIES; THE 2ND DESCRIBES A LESS SUCCESSFUL
PROJECT, WHERE EVENTUALLY FUNCTIONS HAD TO BE PRESCRIBED FOR THE LIBRARY AS A
RESULT OF ITS FAILURE TO DEVELOP ITS OWN SPHERE OF ACTIVITY. THE LAST ARTICLE
DISCUSSES HOW 10 SCHOOLS IN RURAL AREAS ARE PREPARING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF
NEW LIBRARIES, BOTH IN OBTAINING RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE THE LIBRARIES AND IN
ALERTIN G STAFF AND PUPILS.
ISSUES IN SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRITAIN: A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE.

PRESENTS IMPRESSIONS GAINED BY A CANADIAN DURING A 2-WEEK BRITISH COUNCIL
STUDY TOUR OF UK SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN APR 80 AND COMPARES THE UK AND CANADIAN
SCENARIOS. THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN IS A LIBRARIAN 1ST IN THE UK, A TEACHER 1ST IN
CANADA. UK SCHOOL LIBRARIANS SPEND PRECIOUS TIME SELECTING AND CATALOGUING
MATERIALS; CANADIANS RELY ON SELECTION AIDS AND SPEND TIME ON IN-SERVICE
PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO GIVE IDEAS ON USE OF MATERIAL. PROFESSIONAL POLITICS IN
THE UK ARE DESTRUCTIVE. THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE DECISIVE FOR UK SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS WHO MUST DEFINE THEIR GOALS AND DECIDE WHETHER THEY ARE PART OF
EDUCATION OR THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
TIME-EDUCATION-INFORMATION: DISCUSSION NEEDED SO THAT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY CAN
FUNCTION.

CONCLUSIONS FROM A SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE HELD AT
LEANGKOLLEN, NORWAY, JULY 80, INCLUDED THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S ALL-EMBRACING
FUNCTION; THE PRE-EMINENCE OF DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SCANDINAVIA; THE NEED
FOR NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE LIBRARY ACT; AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES' IMPORTANT ROLE IN SCANDINAVIAN CULTURAL COOPERATION. TOPICS
INCLUDED A FORWARD VIEW OF THE SCHOOL'S AIMS AND CURRICULUM; THE CHALLENGE OF
SUPPLYING SUITABLE EDUCATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD IN THE 1980S; THE
STAFFING QUESTION, TEACHER TRAINING BEING SEEN AS MORE VALUABLE THAN ADVANCED
LIBRARY STUDIES; THE NEW TERM 'MEDIA CENTRE', APTLY DESCRIBING THE TRUE
FUNCTION OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY; AND FAIRY TALES IN EDUCATION. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY
IS AN IMPORTANT AID TOWARDS LEARNING OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGES AT THE
EARLIEST POSSIBLE AGE. ESSENTIALS IN NORWAY ARE: A SUFFICIENT ALLOWANCE OF
TIME FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN IN THE CURRICULUM; ADEQUATE EDUCATION FOR SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS; AND INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION ON THE NORWEGIAN SCHOOL LIBRARY
SYSTEM.
THE STRANGE CASE OF SOUTH AFRICAN SCHOOL LIBRARIES. A REPORT OF A WORKING
VISIT.

THE AUTHORS TOURED SOUTH AFRICA IN AUG-SEPT 80, VISITING 42 SCHOOLS, 8
UNIVERSITIES, AND 6 COLLEGES OF EDUCATION. PRESENTS THEIR IMPRESSIONS OF
SCHOOL LIBRARY PROVISION-ALL SCHOOLS FOR EACH RACIAL GROUP POSSESS A LIBRARY
ROOM (USUALLY WITH AN ADJACENT PROJECTION ROOM FOR CLASS USE) AND FULL-TIME
TEACHER-LIBRARIAN; BOOK AND MATERIALS PROVISION IS AVERAGE TO GOOD; PROVINCIAL
AUTHORITIES EXERCISE CONSIDERABLE CONTROL OVER SELECTION AND PROVISION; LOCAL
INITIATIVE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ENCOURAGED; AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE USED
MAINLY FOR FORMAL TEACHING AND DRILLING. DISCUSSES THE EFFECT OF THE TOUR ON
THE AUTHORS' CONCEPT OF THEIR PROFESSION AND THE UK SITUATION.
GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA CENTRES.

HANDBOOK FOR CANADIAN LEARNING RESOURCE CENTRES AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES,
COVERING: THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME AND RESOURCE SERVICES, THE NATURE OF
LEARNING MATERIALS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT; FUNDING; AND PLANNING,
DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION.
THE A.D.A.C.E.S. EXPERIMENT. AN ATTEMPTED EVALUATION.

A PROGRESS REPORT ON A FRENCH PROJECT INITIATED IN 1975 BY THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN SCHOOL ESTABLISHMENTS (A.D.A.C.E.S.). LIBRARY AND
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES WERE ESTABLISHED IN 6 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, AND A NUMBER
OF STUDIES CARRIED OUT. THIS ACCOUNT IS A SYNTHESIS OF THE LAST 5 YEARS' WORK,
AND COVERS (1) CHILDREN'S READING: WHAT THEY READ, SOURCES OF MATERIAL, AND
BORROWING FROM THE CENTRES; (2) HOW THE CENTRES FUNCTION: FORMAL AND INFORMAL
CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, READER VISITS AND USE, THE EDUCATIONAL ROLE OF THE
LIBRARIAN, AND HIS RELATIONS WITH TEACHERS AND CHILDREN; AND (3) THE INFLUENCE
OF THE CENTRES ON TEACHING PRACTICES: TEACHERS' ATTITUDES, AND DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN SCHOOLS IN RECEPTIVITY. REPORTS OF SPECIFIC STUDIES HAVE APPEARED IN A
PERIODICAL DEVOTED TO THE CENTRES, DETAILS OF WHICH ARE GIVEN IN A
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SOME 40 ITEMS, WHICH ALSO INCLUD ES RELEVANT ARTICLES FROM
OTHER FRENCH PERIODICALS.
LIBRARIES IN PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOLS SHOULD BECOME COMMUNITY LIBRARIES.

IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION NOW IS BEING EDUCATED, AND
COMMUNITY INFORMATION CENTRES, SUCH AS LIBRARIES, ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE
INFORMATION WHICH PEOPLE REQUIRE TO KEEP UP WITH DAY-TO-DAY EVENTS. SUCH A
CENTRE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO HELP PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEIR DAILY
LIFE. SINCE THE COUNTRY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH LIBRARIES, MORE USE SHOULD BE
MADE OF EXISTING LIBRARIES, AND MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S LIBRARIES ARE IN
PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOLS, WHICH COULD FEASIBLY EXTEND THEIR SERVICES TO THE
GENERAL PUBLIC. CITES ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT,
CONCLUDING THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE
EFFICIENT LIBRARY SERVICES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
FACING THE PUBLIC.

THE PROCESS OF BRINGING NONUSERS INTO THE LIBRARY IS BEST DONE THROUGH A
LIMITED APPROACH, IDENTIFYING THE LIBRARY'S STRENGTHS AND SHOWING THEIR
IMPORTANCE TO A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE. SUGGESTS HOW A LIBRARY CAN REACH OUT
TO THE PARENTS OF 3 TO 5-YEAR-OLDS AND THEN IMPRESS AND APPEAL TO THE CHILDREN
ONCE THEY ARE IN THE LIBRARY. IF A CHILD IS SUFFICIENTLY MOVED, HE WILL IMPOSE
ON HIS PARENTS TO BRING HIM REGULARLY.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR AFRICANS IN THE R.S.A.

A RECENT POLICY STATEMENT BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT OPENED THE WAY FOR
ALL RACES TO USE LIBRARIES PREVIOUSLY RESERVED FOR WHITES. DESCRIBES LIBRARY
SERVICES FOR AFRICANS, COVERING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL
COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR NON-WHITES (THE DE VAAL
COMMITTEE, REPORTED IN 1965); SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES; PROVISION FOR STUDENTS;
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROVINCES AND NATIONAL STATES; AND THE ROLE OF
NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN ASSISTING DEVELOPMENTS. THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE
FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, AS A MULTI-RACIAL BODY, SHOULD DEVOTE
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION TO PROVISION OF ADEQUATE LIBRARY SERVICES FOR ALL,
ESPECIALLY AFRICANS.
ENOCH PRATT FREE LIBRARY AND BLACK PATRONS: EQUALITY IN LIBRARY SERVICES,
1882-1915.

DISCUSSES THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, AND THE DEMOCRATIC
LIBRARY SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE ENOCH PRATT FREE LIBRARY FROM ITS FOUNDING TO
THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR I.
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CANADA'S MULTICULTURAL SERVICES.

CANADA IS ESSENTIALLY A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS WHO MAINTAIN THEIR CULTURAL
IDENTITY. SINCE 1975 THE NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS PROVIDED SPECIAL LOAN MATERIAL
FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH. DESCRIBES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SERVICE, FROM INITIAL DECISIONS ABOUT LANGUAGE AND
DOCUMENT PRIORITIES, TO PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH PROBLEMS OF SELECTION AND
ACQUISITION, CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION. THE
ORGANISATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IS OUTLINED, AND PLANS TO EXPAND
COLLECTIONS TO INCLUDE NON-BOOK MATERIALS DETAILED. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE A
LIST OF CANADIAN PERIODICALS IN MINORITY LANGUAGES, AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
SERVICES.
LIBRARIES AND THE NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING IMMIGRANT.

EXPLAINS HOW AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN HELP NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING
IMMIGRANTS TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE BY FUNCTIONING AS CLEARINGHOUSES REGARDING
THE AVAILABILITY OF ENGLISH-LANGUAGE CLASSES AND COURSES; STOCKING THE
APPROPRIATE LEARNING MATERIAL, AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS FROM IMMIGRANTS' NATIVE
COUNTRIES (THESE ARE ATTUNED TO THEIR EXPERIENCES AND CAN BE PRESENTED
BILINGUALLY), AND COPIES OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ENGLISH LESSONS; COOPERATING
WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIES; ESTABLISHING LINKS WITH ETHNIC CLUBS AND RELIGIOUS
CENTRES; AND ESTABLISHING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY TO
TRADITIONALLY NON-LIBRARY USERS.
EDUCATIONAL LIBRARIES IN THE LIGHT OF LITERATURE.

IN 1979 THE COUNCIL FOR LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CREATED BY THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION COMPILED A REPORT ON THE STATE OF LIBRARY DEPARTMENTS IN THE FIELD
OF EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT. ALL EDUCATIONAL LIBRARIES IN POLAND, 49 COUNTY
AND 308 BRANCH LIBRARIES, WERE COVERED; WITH THEIR DEVELOPMENT FROM 1945
ONWARDS. THE REPORT COVERS HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT; ROLE OF THE LIBRARIES,
THEIR NEEDS AND DIFFICULTIES; STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARIES; WORK WITH TEACHERS
AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER CENTRES. CONSIDERS AND DISCUSSES THIS REPORT.
THE NATURE OF LIBRARY USE: THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, 1978/79.

A CASE STUDY TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
VIRGINIA WAS USED IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR 1978-79. EXAMINES PRIMARY SOURCES TO
EVALUATE HOW OFTEN THE LIBRARY WAS USED AND MADE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS. ALSO
ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIBRARY COLLECTION AND THE
UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM.
FROM THE STUDY OF STUDENT READERS IN GENERAL AND TECHNICAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN GENERAL AND TECHNICAL SCHOOLS IN POZNAN AND ITS
COUNTY ON THE USE AND INFLUENCE OF BOOKS ON THE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF
THE YOUNG. DESCRIBES HOW THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AND GIVES % RESULTS OF THE
PEOPLE USING LIBRARIES AND THE USE OF REFERENCE BOOKS, LITERATURE AND POPULAR
FICTION. CONCLUDES THAT NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PUPILS IN
THE USE OF LIBRARIES AND REFERENCE MATERIALS.
THE LIBRARY OF THE FINNISH LITERATURE SOCIETY.

THE SOCIETY AND ITS LIBRARY ARE 150 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR. THE CONSTITUTION OF
THE SOCIETY STATED THAT A LIBRARY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO ACT AS A DEPOSITORY
FOR ALL MATERIALS CONCERNED WITH FINNISH CULTURE. AT PRESENT THE STAFF NUMBERS
8. THERE ARE 185,000 BOOKS IN STOCK AND IN 1969 14,581 BOOKS WERE LOANED WHILE
IN 1978 THE FIGURE WAS 35,541. ABOUT 1/2 OF THE USERS OF THE LIBRARY ARE
STUDENTS AND STAFF OF THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY. THE LIBRARY RECEIVES A STATE
GRANT. MOST OF THE FINNISH ACQUISITIONS ARE FREE. THE LIBRARY HAS AN ETHNOLOGY
DEPARTMENT WHICH ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN MATERIALS IN THE FIELD. THE OTHER MAIN
DEPARTMENT OF THE LIBRARY IS THAT OF LITERARY RESEARCH. THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF
THE SOCIETY ARE TO PROVIDE RESEARCH FACILITIES AND TO ACT AS A PUBLISHER.
NEED FOR PRIMARY PERIODICALS AS DETERMINED BY SDI.

AN INVESTIGATION OF PRIMARY PERIODICALS THAT APPEARED IN REFERENCES SELECTED
FROM CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS CONDENSATES WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE OUTPUT FOR ABOUT
2,000 PROFILES. FREQUENCY LISTS, IN ALPHABETICAL AND RANK ORDER, WERE CREATED
FOR THE DATA OBTAINED IN THE COURSE OF ROUTINE PROCESSING OF 2 VOLUMES: 86 AND
89. IN BOTH ISSUES, A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF JOURNALS, FOR EXAMPLE, 212
AND 220 OUT OF 6,209 AND 7,039 TITLES, RESPECTIVELY, SUPPLIED 50% OF THE
RELEVANT PAPERS FOR SDI USERS. THE METHOD IS DESCRIBED, AND THE RESULTS ARE
COMPARED WITH THE CASSI LIST OF JOURNALS MOST FREQUENTLY CITED IN CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS.
THE PUBLIC SERVICE FUNCTIONS OF SERIALS.

DISCUSSES MANY OF THE POSSIBLE RESPONSIBILITIES OF AND DECISIONS RELATING TO
THE PUBLIC USE OF SERIALS COLLECTIONS. CONSIDERS WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE
ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL OR CLASSIFICATION ORDER; FACTORS AFFECTING A DECISION
TO PROVIDE OPEN STACK COLLECTIONS THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE FOR
PUBLIC USE OR CLOSED ONES WHICH ARE SERVICED ON A PAGING SYSTEM; AND THE
REFERENCE FUNCTIONS OF SERIALS WORK. FINALLY, QUESTIONS WHETHER PERIODICALS
OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO CIRCULATE OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY.
ARCHIVES AND LIBRARIES.

FOLLOWING A 1979 STUDY TOUR COVERING 6 LOCAL HISTORY ARCHIVES IN DENMARK,
RELATIONSHIPS, JOINT FUNCTIONS AND FINANCE OF SUCH ARCHIVES AND LOCAL HISTORY
COLLECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED. THE 1ST LOCAL HISTORY ARCHIVE IN DENMARK WAS
ESTABLISHED IN FABORG IN 1937; BY 1979 THERE WERE ABOUT 240. A 1978 REPORT
DEFINED MATERIAL BELONGING RESPECTIVELY TO LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS AND LOCAL
HISTORY ARCHIVES, RECOMMENDING COORDINATION BY THE LIBRARY BUT CONSIDERABLE
AUTONOMY FOR THE ARCHIVES. WHILE DETAILS DIFFER, COOPERATION SEEMS GENERALLY
SATISFACTORY. FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS VARY WIDELY, STILL WITH MANY VOLUNTARY
ARCHIVISTS. WITH NO COMPARABLE ACTIVITY IN NORWAY, IT SEEMS NECESSARY TO
SURVEY EXISTING RESOURCES AND INSTITUTIONS AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION.
PRIORITIES ARE COLLECTION, ARRANGEMENT AND INDEXING, CONSERVATION, AND
AVAILABILITY. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THOUGH THE NATURAL HOME FOR LOCAL HISTORY
ARCHIVES, WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCE AND STAFFING. LOCAL ORGANISATIONS
SHOULD  BE APPROACHED, MANPOWER AND RESOURCES COORDINATED, AND HELP SOUGHT
FROM REGIONAL AND CENTRAL AUTHORITIES.
GUIDE TO THE ARCHIVES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. PART 1. THE UNITED
NATIONS SYSTEM. PRELIMINARY VERSION.

THE PRELIMINARY UNESCO DIRECTORY TO ARCHIVAL RESOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL
ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE PART OF UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION IS INTENDED TO HELP
OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO RESEARCH AND INFORMATION TRANSFER. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE

PRIVATE ARCHIVES: AN ESSAY ON METHODOLOGY.

A KEEPER AT THE FRENCH NATIONAL ARCHIVES DISCUSSES THE RECENTLY COMPLETED
ARRANGEMENT AND INVENTORY OF SOME 50 TONS OF RECORDS FROM THE ROYAL HOUSE OF
FRANCE (BOURBON-ORLEANS DYNASTY), IN RELATION TO THE GENERAL PROBLEMS OF
PRIVATE ARCHIVES, HISTORICAL AND MODERN. CONSIDERS THE METHODOLOGICAL
PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE MAKE-UP OF DOCUMENTS; SELECTION
AND DISPOSAL; RULES FOR ARRANGEMENT, PARTICULARLY FOR 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY
CORRESPONDENCE FILES, WHICH CAN CONTAIN MATERIAL FOR MAJOR HISTORICAL
IMPORTANCE AS WELL AS SOCIAL TRIVIA; THE REORGANISATION OF MATERIAL PREVIOUSLY
SUBJECTED TO 1 OR SEVERAL DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS; THE FACILITATION OF USER
ACCESS; AND CONSERVATION AND STORAGE TECHNIQUES.
RECENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS IN ARCHIVES IN AFRICA SOUTH OF THE
SAHARA AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE EXPATRIATE RESEARCHER.

DISCUSSES PUBLICATIONS BY AND ABOUT AFRICAN ARCHIVES SOUTH OF THE SAHARA
ISSUED DURING THE LATE 1950S AND 1960S; THE GROWTH IN SUCH PUBLICATIONS AND
JOURNAL ARTICLES DURING THE 1970S; THE PROGRESS IN AFRICAN ARCHIVAL
DEVELOPMENT DURING THE 1970S; THE INCREASED CONTROL OF ACCESS TO ARCHIVAL
COLLECTIONS; THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE RETURN OF AFRICAN ARCHIVES FROM FORMER
COLONIAL RULERS; AND THE MICROFILMING OF AFRICAN ARCHIVES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS
WILL HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON EXPATRIATE RESEARCHERS, WHO SHOULD SUPPORT THE
DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF AFRICAN ARCHIVISTS IN WHICHEVER WAYS POSSIBLE.
LIBRARY CENSORSHIP AND THE PERMISSIVE MINORITY.

RE-ANALYSES A NATION-WIDE SURVEY OF US ADULTS CONDUCTED IN 1970 FOR THE
COMMISSION ON OBSCENITY AND PORNOGRAPHY TO PERMIT NEW COMPARISONS OF THE LARGE
MAJORITY WHO FAVOURED LIBRARY CENSORSHIP OF 'EROTICA' WITH THE MINORITY WHO
OPPOSED IT. AS EXPECTED FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS-FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OPPOSING CENSORSHIP WERE
YOUNGER, BETTER EDUCATED, MORE OPEN TO MASS MEDIA, AND BY A NUMBER OF
MEASURES, MORE LIBERAL OR PERMISSIVE. THE ANTICENSORSHIP POSITION APPEARS TO
BE PART OF A GENERAL LIBERAL IDEOLOGY THAT EXTENDS TO SUCH ISSUES AS RACIAL
INTEGRATION AND EVNIRONMENTALISM. FURTHER, THE ANTICENSORSHIP GROUP HAS MUCH
IN COMMON WITH THE GROUP IDENTIFIED BY OTHER STUDIES AS USERS OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES (IN ARABIC).

EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS IN ANY LIBRARY
COLLECTION, AND LISTS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT A LIBRARY MAY FACE WHEN
BUILDING AN AV COLLECTION. SOME SOLUTIONS MAY BE THE PROVISION OF TECHNICAL
FACILITIES, PROVISION OF SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE THE HARDWARE, PROVISION OF
PROFESSIONAL AND TRAINED PERSONNEL TO OPERATE AND TEACH OTHERS IN THE USE OF
EQUIPMENT, AND SELECTION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF AV MATERIAL.

ENTERTAINMENT AND FOR INSTRUCTION/EDUCATION AND THE SYSTEMS PRODUCED BY RCA
AND MCA, AMONG OTHERS, WITH TECHNICAL DETAILS. BRIEFLY MENTIONS THE ADVANTAGES
FOR LIBRARIES OF STOCKING VIDEODISCS AS OPPOSED TO FILMS AND FILM PROJECTORS.
THE GREAT EITHER/OR DEBATE; OR COPING WITH THE CULTURAL CONTINUUM.(P

APER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL GATHERING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND
GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL 12 APR 80.) DISCUSSION OF POPULAR CULTURE IN
LIBRARIES, REVIEWING THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEFINING 'POPULAR CULTURE', AND
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN POPULAR, HIGH AND MASS CULTURE. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
SUPPORTS POPULAR CULTURE IN TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS,
REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND, EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC CLASS, BUT IS IN A CATCH-22
SITUATION OF TRYING TO RESPOND AT ALL LEVELS, BUT WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WITH THE
BEST IN EACH OF THESE LEVELS; THUS THE LIBRARIAN MUST STILL BE SELECTIVE, AND
ACCORDINGLY REJECT WORKS WHICH SOME MAY STILL WANT OR NEED.
EVALUATION OF THE RELIGION COLLECTION. JOHN DAVIS WILLIAMS LIBRARY, THE
UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI.

DESCRIBES THE FINDINGS OF A COLLECTION EVALUATION THAT SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY THE
MINIMUM HOLDINGS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ADEQUATELY TO SUPPORT A VIABLE
UNDERGRADUATE RELIGION MAJOR, TO ASSESS THE RELIGION COLLECTION FROM AN
INTERDISCIPLINARY VIEWPOINT, AND TO DETERMINE WHAT MATERIALS COULD BE WEEDED
OUT. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CATHOLIC DIOCESAN ARCHIVES: A RENAISSANCE IN PROGRESS.

DESCRIBES THE RECENT AWAKENING OF INTEREST IN CATHOLIC CHURCH ARCHIVES IN THE
USA. GIVES BRIEF DETAILS OF THE KIND OF RECORDS TO BE FOUND IN DIOCESAN
ARCHIVES, AND DISCUSSES VARIOUS APPROACHES TO DEALING WITH THESE RECORDS.
CONSIDERS SEVERAL SERIOUS PROBLEMS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING FACED BY DIOCESAN
ARCHIVISTS.
THE IMPACT OF BASIC RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: THE CASE OF EDUCATION.

RECENT EVALUATIONS OF THE CONDITION AND FUNDING OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH IN THE
USA ASSUMES THAT BASIC RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN
INCREASING UNDERSTANDING OF AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVING THE PRACTICE OF
EDUCATION. PAST TESTS OF THIS ASSUMPTION, HOWEVER, HAVE GENERALLY RELIED UPON
ARGUMENT BY EXAMPLE OR ANECDOTE. IN THIS STUDY, CITATION PATTERNS IN EDUCATION
LITERATURE ARE ANALYSED TO TEST THE COROLLARY PROPOSITION THAT BASIC RESEARCH
IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES HAS HAD A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON EDUCATION LITERATURE.
EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED ON CITATION PATTERNS IN THE EDUCATION LITERATURE ARE
FOUND TO BE LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROPOSITION.
GUIDE TO HOLDINGS OF ERIC MICROFICHE IN AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES.

ERIC IS ACCESSIBLE TO EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHERS IN AUSTRALIA THROUGH THE
MICROFICHE COLLECTIONS LISTED IN THIS DIRECTORY OR THROUGH AUSINET AND SEARCH
SERVICES PROVIDED BY LOCKHEED AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY EDUCATION INFORMATION SERVICE ALSO OFFERS A MONTHLY SDI SERVICE FROM
ERIC. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDES A CONTACT PERSON, ACCESSIBILITY,
COLLECTION SCOPE (SUBJECT), AND AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE ORGANISATIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF AN UNIFIED COLLECTION OF
LITERATURE ON NATURAL SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN ANALYSIS OF THE ORGANISATION AND OF THE STRUCTURE
OF THE UNIFIED INFORMATION STOCK (LITERATURE ON NATURAL SCIENCES AND
TECHNOLOGY) OF THE ARMENIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. THE ANALYSIS
CONCENTRATES ON 3 MAIN AREAS: ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATION OF THE STOCK;
SUBJECT COVERAGE; AND TERRITORIAL DISTRIBUTION. CHEMICAL LITERATURE REPRESENTS
THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF THE STOCK. MOST OF THE INFORMATION STOCK IS LOCATED
IN THE EREVAN REGION (88.4%), WHILE ONLY 0.3% OF THE STOCK IS LOCATED IN THE
KAFAN REGION, DUE TO THE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE
REGIONS.
A RANK-FREQUENCY MODEL FOR SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY.

THE MODEL DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITIONS OF 'A CONTRIBUTION' AND 'RANK' OF AN
AUTHOR. 3 ESTIMATION PROCEDURES ARE ILLUSTRATED AND 4 OTHER SCIENTIFIC
PRODUCTIVITY STUDIES AND 2 DATA SETS ON CANADIAN MATHEMATICIANS ARE SHOWN TO
FIT THIS RANK-FREQUENCY RELATIONSHIP ADEQUATELY.
CITATION ANALYSIS SIGNIFICANCE OF SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS.

THE APPLICATION OF METHODS OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO
EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS ON ONE ANOTHER. THESE METHODS ARE
USED TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SIMILAR SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS BY THEIR
CROSS-CITATIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DATA FROM THE JOURNAL CITATION REPORTS
(JCR). THEY ALSO HELP TO IMPROVE THE JCR STRUCTURE AND WIDEN ITS USES FOR THE
EVALUATION OF SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS. THESE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO ANALYSE
CRITICALLY THE PRINCIPLES OF RANKING JOURNALS IN PACKAGE 1 AND THE TABULAR
CONTENTS OF JCR'S PACKAGES 2 AND 3, AS WELL AS TO STUDY FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
OF THE JOURNALS BOTH IN TIME AND SPACE.
CITATION AND CO-CITATION INDICATORS OF A PHASED IMPACT OF THE BCS THEORY IN
THE PHYSICS OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY.

AN INTELLECTUAL ACCOUNT OF THE PHYSICS OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY WAS COMPARED WITH
CITATION AND COCITATION DATA DURING 2 HISTORICAL PERIODS THAT COINCIDED WITH
THE INTRODUCTION OF ITS CENTRAL EXPLANATORY THEORY (BCS). INVESTIGATES THE
COCITATION DATA THROUGH FACTOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS GIVE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT TO A
HYPOTHESIS THAT DISTINGUISHES IMPACT PHRASES IN THE EFFECT OF THE THEORY ON
THE COGNITIVE ORGANISATION OF THE SPECIALITY. IT IS ALSO OBSERVED THAT
CITATION AND COCITATION DATA ARE SEPARATE TYPES OF INFORMATION WHICH, UNDER
SOME HISTORICAL CONDITIONS, GIVE DIFFERING RESULTS.

A CHECKLIST OF THE AUSTRIAN GRADUALS, ANTIPHONERS AND NOTED MISSALS IN HMML.
POETRY AT BUFFALO: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY COLLECTION.

THE TWENTIETH CENTURY COLLECTION AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT
BUFFALO WAS STARTED BY CHARLES ABBOTT IN 1935 AS A WORKSHOP WHERE POEMS IN ALL
STAGES FROM CONCEPTION TO COMPLETION (WORKSHEETS ARE INCLUDED) COULD BE
STUDIED AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS ANALYSED. HE TOURED THE USA, URGING POETS TO
CONTRIBUTE MATERIAL AND VISIT THE COLLECTION. THE COLLECTION NEW COMPRISES
64,500 VOLUMES, 780 PHONORECORDS, 400 TAPES OF AUTHORS READING THEIR OWN WORK,
AND 2,450 SETS OF SMALL MAGAZINES AND PERIODICALS (WHICH ARE OFTEN THE 1ST,
AND SOMETIMES ONLY, SHOWCASE FOR A POET'S WORK). NOTABLE HOLDINGS ARE THE
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL ON WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS, JAMES JOYCE, ROBERT
GRAVES, AND DYLAN THOMAS.
PUBLIC LIBRARY BOARDS: AN EXPLORATION OF THEIR VIABILITY IN LIBRARY GOVERNANCE.

WHILST LIBRARY BOARDS HAVE FOR A LONG TIME GOVERNED US PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THEY
ARE RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS, BUT FEW LIBRARIANS ARE WILLING TO PUBLICISE THEIR
DISSATISFACTION WITH PRESENT BOARD-LIBRARIAN RELATIONSHIPS. BRIEFLY SURVEYS
THE HISTORY OF LIBRARY BOARDS AND THEIR PRESENT MODUS OPERANDI. SUMMARISES
RESEARCH FINDINGS ON LIBRARY BOARDS. MAIN FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A
SERIOUS LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND TRUSTEE; BOARDS TEND TO BE
ADVISORY ONLY; AND THERE IS A TREND TOWARDS MAINTENANCE OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY
BOARDS-BUT BOARDS MUST BE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF COMMUNITIES, A MOVE THAT
WOULD BROADEN THEIR POLITICAL BASE AND HELP IN SECURING SUPPORT.
THE PLANNING PROCESS-IS IT FOR ME?.N

OTES THE CONCERN GENERATED AMONGST SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED US PUBLIC LIBRARIES
BY THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S A PLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
AND DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING. ADVISES LIBRARIANS ON HOW TO DEVELOP
A CONFIDENT PLANNING ATTITUDE, AND HOW TO ESTABLISH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND
REALISE THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS. AIMS NOT AT CREATING ANOTHER PLANNING
PROCESS, BUT AT ENCOURAGING AMONGST LIBRARIANS THE SELF CONFIDENCE TO DIGEST
WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN, AND TO CHOOSE THAT WHICH BEST SUITS THEIR INDIVIDUAL
SITUATION.
THE NEW PLA PLANNING PROCESS.

EXPLANATION OF WHY THE NEW US PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION PLANNING PROCESS
EXISTS, WHY WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON IT, WHAT THE OLD STANDARDS MEAN, AND
THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR NEW STANDARDS IN THE FUTURE. THE NEW PROCESS VIEWS THE
EXISTING SERVICE PROGRAMME, ESTABLISHES PRIORITIES, AND CONSIDERS
MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES WITHIN THE PROGRAMME. WHEN ALL LOCAL SERVICES
ARE COMPETING FOR THE SAME LIMITED MONIES, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY MUST USE THE
PLANNING PROCESS TO GAIN PUBLIC SUPPORT.
DOES RATIONALISATION MEAN CUTS IN STAFF?.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SERVICE POINTS OF
KOKKOLA PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SOON AFTER THE REORGANIZATION A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY
WAS OBTAINED AND THE WORKLOAD WAS INCREASED GREATLY. TWICE THE LIBRARY SERVICE
APPLIED TO THE COUNCIL FOR MORE STAFF AND WERE TURNED DOWN. IN 1980 THE
COUNCIL DECIDED TO CARRY OUT AN O&M SURVEY CONCENTRATING ON THE STAFF
REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT 2 EXTRA PERMANENT STAFF AND
5 PART-TIME STAFF SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. THE SURVEY ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATION FOR
2 FURTHER SURVEYS: TO SEE WHETHER IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO INCREASE THE USE
OF CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICES AND TO LOOK AT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.
RATIONALISATION IN PRACTICE.

WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION, TORNIO PUBLIC LIBRARIES ENDED UP WITH
SEVERAL SMALL SERVICE POINTS. SOME OF THESE HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED BY BOOK
MOBILES. ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING ARE NOW CENTRALIZED AND LIBRARY SERVICES
LTD IS USED FOR MOST OF THE CATALOGUING. BOOKS ARE PROCESSED IN BRANCH
LIBRARIES. WHEN A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING IS BEING PLANNED THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS
IN RATIONALISATION SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT: THE USE OF CENTRALISED
CATALOGUING SERVICES AND COMPUTERISED LENDING AND OVERDUES.
ON DEMANDS TO REMODEL LIBRARY CONDITIONS AT THE 5 'OLD' UNIVERSITIES
(TECHNICAL COLLEGES) IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA.

THE 1979/80 LIBRARY GUIDE TO THE AACHEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A CRITIQUE OF CONDITIONS AT THE LIBRARY. AACHEN IS NOW A
UNIVERSITY WITH ALMOST 30,000 STUDENTS BUT THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IS LARGELY
DECENTRALISED WITH MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES. SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN
REORGANISED AND REHOUSED, BUT MANY STILL NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED. THERE IS A
LACK OF CENTRALISATION AND COORDINATION WHICH CAN BE FOUND OUT MOST OF THE
'OLD' NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE NOT PLANNED, CAMPUS
UNIVERSITIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF LIBRARY STOCK.
LIBRARY GUIDES SUCH AS THE AACHEN EXAMPLE ARE OF GREAT VALUEAND SHOULD BE
PUBLISHED AT ALL THE LIBRARIES. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO INTEGRATE SMALL
INSTITUTE LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WORK. LIBRARIANS ARE OF THE
OPINION THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THAT PLANS
AND LAWS FOR REMODELLING LIBRARY CONDITIONS SHOULD BEWARE OF GENERALISATION.
THE PITTSBURGH REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTER: A CASE STUDY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
'FULL SERVICE NETWORK'.

EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT, OPERATION AND FUTURE OF THE PITTSBURGH REGIONAL
LIBRARY CENTER (PRLC) A MULTI-STATE, MULTI-TYPE LIBRARY NETWORK. INCORPORATED
IN 1967, PRLC HAS DEVELOPED INTO A 'FULL SERVICE NETWORK' WHICH PROVIDES OCLC
SERVICE, RLG/RLIN SERVICE, CONTINUING EDUCATION, ON-LINE UNION LISTING,
CONSULTING, COOPERATIVE PURCHASING AND RECIPROCAL BORROWING TO ITS 65 LIBRARY
MEMBERS IN 3 STATES. DISCUSSES PRLC'S PLANS FOR THE 1980S.
SELF-SUFFICIENCY IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR A NATION.

PAPER PRESENTED TO THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION COUNCIL, JAN 81, BY THE DIRECTOR OF
THE DIVISION OF THE GENERAL INFORMATION PROGRAMME, UNESCO. NEW TECHNOLOGY, LOW
FUNDS AND UNDER-UTILISATION OF EXISTING SERVICES AND SYSTEMS HAVE MADE
SELF-SUFFICIENCY FOR LIBRARIES NO LONGER POSSIBLE, AND THE FUTURE MUST SEE
COOPERATION IN THE INFORMATION WORLD THROUGH SUCH PROGRAMMES AS GIP.
SCANDINAVIAN COOPERATION IN THE LIBRARY FIELD: A CRITICAL EXAMINATION.

REFLECTIONS ON THE VALUE AND/OR NECESSITY OF PAN-SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARY
CONFERENCES, RECALLING THEIR PAST ACHIEVEMENTS IN ATTAINING COOPERATION
BETWEEN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND IN EXPRESSING AN INTANGIBLE BUT
DEFINITE SCANDINAVIAN UNITY. TODAY, WHILE SEVERAL SCANDINAVIAN ORGANISATIONS
ARE FORMALLY INVOLVED IN LIBRARY COOPERATION, THE CONFERENCES ACT AS CATALYSTS
FOR LATENT PROGRESS AND FRUITFUL DISCONTENT. THEY SHOULD REFLECT PROFESSIONAL
ACTIVITY SINCE THE LAST CONFERENCE, AND REVEAL ANY RESULTING COMMON
DENOMINATORS. THEIR MAIN FUNCTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MARKET-PLACE FOR
IDEAS, IN A SETTING ADAPTED TO THE ESTABLISHING AND DEVELOPING OF
PROFESSIONAL, SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
THE COUNCIL OF RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES: AN EXAMPLE OF INTERLIBRARY
COOPERATION.

EXAMINES THE HISTORY, ORGANISATION, AND ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF RESEARCH
AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, A MULTITYPE LIBRARY COOPERATIVE COMPOSED OF ACADEMIC,
PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND LOCATED IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. THE
CONSORTIUM'S HISTORY IS TRACED FROM THE EVENTS PRECEDING ITS FOUNDING IN 1966
TO THE PRESENT TIME, AND THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF CORAL TOGETHER WITH
ITS SUBGROUPS AND MAJOR ACTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
DIRECTORY OF TEXAS LIBRARY NETWORKS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

THIS DIRECTORY OF 62 LIBRARY NETWORKS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS WAS PRODUCED
FROM INFORMATION COLLECTED IN PREPARATION FOR THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF TEXAS
LIBRARY NETWORKS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, COSPONSORED BY THE TEXAS LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION AND THE TEXAS STATE LIBRARY, FEB 25-26, 1980 IN AUSTIN. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CO-OPERATION: PAPUA NEW GUINEA.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE LAA/NZLA CONFERENCE, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND, 21 JAN
81. DISCUSSES THE PRESENT STATE OF LIBRARY PROVISION IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA,
EXISTING COOPERATIVE PROGRAMMES WITHIN NEW GUINEA AND BEYOND, AND URGENT AREAS
REQUIRING COOPERATION BETWEEN PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND.
CIRCLE OF STATE LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE ON GOVERNMENT LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
NETWORKS.

THE CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN THE RUNCIMAN LECTURE THEATRE, NATIONAL MARITIME
MUSEUM, GREENWICH, 29 OCT 80. REVIEWS PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE
CONFERENCE, COVERING SUCH TOPICS AS SUBJECT LEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION WITHIN
GOVERNMENT, THE MAFF LIBRARY NETWORK AND REGIONAL COOPERATION, AND EUROPEAN
AND INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES?.

THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS
NOW WELL ESTABLISHED IN FINLAND. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL
BECOME OPERATIONAL IN 1981. THE WORK FOR A NETWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES
HAS NOT BEEN STARTED. THE 6 CENTRAL LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED SO FAR COVER ONLY
SOME SCIENCES AND NO EXTRA FUNDING HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY.
IN 1974 THE COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION GAVE THE BASIC MODEL FOR
ESTABLISHING A NETWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES. THIS WOULD INCLUDE A NATIONAL
LIBRARY, A CENTRE FOR INTERLENDING, AND CENTRAL LIBRARIES FOR DIFFERENT
SCIENCES. NO CENTRE FOR INTERLENDING EXISTS YET, AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF
THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AS A NATIONAL LIBRARY NEED CLARIFICATION.
COOPERATION AMONG UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA-PROBLEMS, PERSPECTIVES,
PROSPECTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR NATIONAL PLANNING.

(DLS THESIS-COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.) DESCRIBES A STUDY WHICH AIMED TO EXAMINE THE
NATURE AND EXTENT OF COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES AMONG NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HISTORICAL AND EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS; EVALUATE
THE ROLE OF ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE ENCOURAGED SUCH
COOPERATION; IDENTIFY THE EXPRESSED NEEDS OF PRIMARY USERS OF THE LIBRARIES;
DISCOVER THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN ACTIVITIES (THE MAJOR
COOPERATIVE ACTIVITY); AND INVESTIGATE THE ATTITUDES OF LIBRARIANS AND FACULTY
TOWARDS INTERLIBRARY LOAN.
COOPERATION AMONG SCANDINAVIAN SPECIAL LIBRARIES-TWO PRACTICAL EXAMPLES.

DISCUSSES 2 EXAMPLES OF COOPERATION IN SCANDINAVIAN COMMERCIAL COLLEGE
LIBRARIES AND CENTRAL EDUCATIONAL LIBRARIES, INCLUDING INTER-LIBRARY LENDING,
COOPERATIVE PERIODICALS ACQUISITION AND COOPERATIVE CLASSIFICATION.
THE EXAMPLE OF THE 'MARBURG MODEL'.

CRITICAL SUMMARY OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN INTRODUCING A COORDINATED LIBRARY
SYSTEM AT MARBURG UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY SUITED AS A MODEL FOR THIS
PURPOSE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUE HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE
THE 19TH CENTURY AND HAD BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EXTENDED SINCE 1962; AND NEW
BUILDINGS FOR MANY OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES HAVE LED TO EXCELLENT LENDING
CONDITIONS AND CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE COORDINATION PROGRAMME AIMS AT, AND HAS PARTIALLY REALISED THE
INTEGRATION OF MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES INTO 28 LIBRARY COMPLEXES WITH
52 INDEPENDANT LIBRARY UNITS. ONE IMPORTANT MEASURE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY INTEGRATING THE PRESENT 37 DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IT IS
POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE PROGRAMME INITIATED AT MARBURG WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED
COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION IN THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR
UNIVERSITIES OF A SIMILAR STRUCTURE.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AS A CATALYST OF SOCIAL CHANGE.

DESCRIBES THE ROLE IN SOCIETY OF SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. SUGGESTS
THAT UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES SHOULD FILL THE GAP BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE
COMMUNITY BY OFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO (AND INITIATING SPECIAL SERVICES FOR)
CERTAIN SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. DESCRIBES HOW THE
JAWAHARLAL NEHRU UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN NEW DELHI IS EXTENDING ITS SERVICES TO
PEOPLE FROM THE DIFFERENT STRATA OF SOCIETY.
A LOOK AT COMMUNITY ANALYSIS: SOME MYTHS AND SOME REALITIES.

LIBRARIANS CAN DISCOVER HOW TO INTEGRATE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY INTO COMMUNITY
LIFE THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY ANALYSIS. DISCUSSES THE MYTHS WHICH
SURROUND COMMUNITY ANALYSIS-FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT IS NOTHING NEW, TAKES TOO
LONG AND IS NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT. CONTENDS THAT THE IDEA IS NOT NEW, BUT
THE STUDY TECHNIQUES ARE, COMMUNITY ANALYSIS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO, AND THAT
THE INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE.
PUBLIC RELATIONS IN THE 1980S.

A DISCOURSE ON LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC RELATIONS.
NO LIBRARY CAN ACHIEVE ITS GOALS IF IT IS NOT CONSCIOUS OF ITS PUBLIC
FUNCTIONS, AND A VARIED PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME, ENTHUSIASTICALLY PRESENTED
CAN DO MUCH TO GAIN TOTAL SUPPORT FOR, AND WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN, THE
LIBRARY. IN THE FUTURE PUBLIC RELATIONS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT
FUNCTION, MORE COST-ORIENTED, BETTER PUBLICISED, SLICKER AND MORE
PROFESSIONAL, AND THERE WILL BE BETTER EDUCATION FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS.
DISCUSSES WHAT THE LIBRARIAN CAN DO TO INVOLVE HIM/HERSELF MORE IN THE PUBLIC
RELATIONS PROGRAMME.
A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TOWARDS A NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR MALAWI
(NATIS).

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNESCO NATIS CONCEPT. INFORMATION
SOURCES IN MALAWI ARE UNCOORDINATED, THERE IS A LACK OF COOPERATION BETWEEN
INFORMATION RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL.
DISCUSSES NATIONAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS, AND LISTS NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR MALAWI-(1) A NATIONAL INFORMATION POLICY; (2) STIMULATION OF
USER AWARENESS; (3) PROMOTION OF THE READING HABIT; (4) ASSESSMENT OF USER
NEEDS; (5) ANALYSIS OF EXISTING RESOURCES; (6) ANALYSIS OF MANPOWER RESOURCES;
(7) SUPPLY OF MANPOWER; (8) PLANNING THE NATIS ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE; (9)
PLANNING TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDS; (10) THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK; (11) FINANCE;
AND UBC. PRESENTS MODELS OF EACH SECTOR OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM.
CURRENT PUBLIC LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA-EXPERIENCES AND APPROACHES
TO PROBLEMS.

A LIBRARY COMMISSION ON THE REFORM OF DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARY LEGISLATION
PRESENTED ITS REPORT IN 1979, PROPOSING A LIBRARY ACT COVERING BOTH PUBLIC AND
SPECIAL LIBRARIES, WITH A JOINT LIBRARY DIRECTORATE. ALL LIBRARY STOCKS SHOULD
BE AVAILABLE THROUGH AN INTER-LIBRARY LOAN CENTRE. THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY,
AT PRESENT PRODUCED IN SECTIONS, SHOULD BE TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE. THE FREE
LENDING PRINCIPLE IS MAINTAINED. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AFTER A 5-YEAR TRANSITIONAL
PERIOD, SHOULD BE WHOLLY FINANCED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITHIN 2 YEARS.
MUSIC LIBRARIES SHOULD BE OBLIGATORY. PROPOSED CHANGES FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES
EMPHASISE A NEED FOR COORDINATION. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES WOULD
BE TRANSFERRED TO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM UNDER A RECENT ACT, IN AN ATTEMPT TO
UNIFY THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. ALL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE OBLIGED TO
ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER LIBRARIES SUITABLE FOR THEIR NEEDS.
THE LEGAL STATUS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE RHINELAND PALATINATE.

THE 1978 RHINELAND PALATINATE STATE LAW ON UNIVERSITIES HAS MADE THE POSITION
OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT WAS UNDER THE 1970 LAW WITH
REGARD TO THEIR SPHERES OF COMPETENCE. CURRENT LEGISLATION IS PARTICULARLY
VAGUE ABOUT WHO SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS IN LIBRARY AFFAIRS, THE RIGHTS OF THE
VARIOUS UNIVERSITY BODIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER. DETAILED
ANALYSIS IS MADE OF THE 1978 LAW AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE LIBRARY, THE LEGAL
POSITION OF THE LIBRARY, ITS DIRECTOR AND THE SENATE AND OF INDIVIDUAL LEGAL
PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE AUTHORITY FOR STOCK PURCHASE, CONTROL OF STAFFING AND
FINANCE, DECISIONS ON STAFFING MADE BY THE SENATE PRESIDENT, THE LIBRARY'S
TASKS OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY AND LEGAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND OTHER
UNIVERSITY BODIES. THIS ANALYSIS COULD PROVE HELPFUL TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
IN OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR LAWS.
PRESENTATION ON SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT.

PAPER GIVEN AT THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LIBRARY SCHOOLS CONFERENCE, AUSTIN,
TEXAS, FEB 80. PROVIDES A BASIC LEVEL OF INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING TO
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SCHOOLS REGARDING 'NON-DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF
HANDICAP IN PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES RECEIVING OR BENEFITING FROM FEDERAL
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE' AS SPECIFIED IN THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION
AND WELFARE'S SECTION 504 REGULATION OF THE 1973 REHABILITATION ACT. GIVES A
BRIEF HISTORY OF EVENTS LEADING TO THE PASSAGE OF THE ACT AND THE PROMULGATION
OF THE SECTION 504 REGULATION. MAKES SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING LIBRARY ACCESS TO
THE HANDICAPPED.
LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION: A HUMANISTIC APPROACH.

RECENT MANAGEMENT TRENDS IN LIBRARIANSHIP HAVE BEEN TOWARDS A HUMANISTIC
APPROACH, WITH EMPHASIS ON QUALITY OF SERVICE AND STAFF SATISFACTION. REVIEWS
SOME OF THE LITERATURE RELATED TO HUMANISTIC MANAGEMENT-BOTH FROM LIBRARY AND
MANAGEMENT JOURNALS.
ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGERS AND THEIR MOTIVATION TO MANAGE.

(PHD THESIS-RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, NEW JERSEY.) DESCRIBES AND PRESENTS THE
RESULTS OF A STUDY EXAMINING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MANAGERIAL
ROLE-REQUIREMENT THEORY OF JOHN B. MINER TO ACADEMIC LIBRARY SETTINGS AND FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGERS.
LIBRARY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS 1: THE OBJECTIVES.

EXAMINES THE STEPS INVOLVED IN DRAWING UP A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES FOR A
LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A PRELIMINARY TO CARRYING OUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM.
DISCUSSES THE DEFINITION OF: INTERNAL OBJECTIVES, WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY
INTERVIEWING, JOB ANALYSIS, FLOW CHARTING, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DECISION
TABLES; AND EXTERNAL OBJECTIVES, WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH THE EFFICIENT
ORGANISATION OF THE 3 MAIN LIBRARY FUNCTIONS-COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND RAPID
RETRIEVAL OF MATERIAL.

MONEY TO ENABLE LIBRARIES TO SURVIVE.
ON ALLOCATIONS TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA
IN THE PERIOD FROM 1975 TO 1980.

THE NEW BUDGET ACCOUNTING SYSTEM INTRODUCED IN 1975 WAS SUCCESSFUL AND
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN APPROPRIATIONS OF FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS AND EXPENDITURE
WERE KEPT WITHIN LIMITS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALLOCATIONS AVAILABLE TO
LIBRARIES FOR LITERATURE ACQUISITION ROSE BY 27%. LIBRARY POSTS AVAILABLE
DURING THE PERIOD ROSE BY 7.7% (150 POSTS). MOST NEW PERSONNEL WERE
CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW INTEGRATED UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND ALSO IN THE
TRADITIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. OVER 3 MILLION DM WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR
AUTOMATION PROCESSES AT LIBRARIES IN 1980. ALTOUGH MANY NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS
WERE ERECTED IN THE PERIOD THERE IS STILL NOT SUFFICIENT SPACE FOR
ACCOMMODATING ALL THE NECESSARY LITERATURE. FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS WERE
INCREASED FOR THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY CENTRE, THE CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY
(ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER MEDIZIN) AND THE INSTITUTE OF LIBRARIANSHIP, ALTHOUGH
ACCOMMODATION HERE IS STILL UNSATISFACTORY.
REVENUE SHARING AND STATE FUNDING IN INDIANA: PROSPECTS IMPROVE FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.

IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
ABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE
PROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
ENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED
GOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR
OWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF
SENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED
ONLY BY THE CONCERN OF LIBRARIANS ABOUT STATE LEGISLATORS' COMMITMENT TO
CONTINUE STATE FUNDING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
OVERCOMING THE RETRENCHMENT BLUES-OVERRIDING THE 106% TAX LIMITATION RULES IN
WASHINGTON STATE.

THE '106% RULE' IS A TAX LIMITATION TIED TO THE 'MILLAGE RATE'-EXPRESSED IN
'CENTS PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ASSOCIATED VALUATION. FOR EVERY $1,000 OF
ASSESSED VALUATION, LIBRARIES IN WASHINGTON STATE COLLECTED 50 CENTS PER YEAR,
BUT NOW THE RATE CHANGES ANNUALLY TO ENSURE THAT THE TOTAL COLLECTED WILL NOT
EXCEED 106% OF WHAT WAS COLLECTED IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THE YEAR BEFORE.
TAKING KITSAP COUNTY, WASHINGTON, AS AN EXAMPLE, ILLUSTRATES WHAT LIBRARY
DISTRICTS CAN DO, AND ARE DOING TO COPE WITH THE RULE, AND THE RULE'S EFFECTS
ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
WHY PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD BE FREE.

REPORT BY THE FREEMANTLE CITY COUNCIL URGING THE CONTINUATION OF A FREE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE, IN THE FACE OF SUGGESTIONS BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
ASSOCIATION THAT CHARGES BE LEVIED FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE. THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY IS OF REAL VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY, AND AN INFORMED CITIZENRY IS
CONSIDERED VITAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS; INFORMATION IS NECESSARY IN
EDUCATION AND RECREATION. SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE
COORDINATED STATEWIDE LIBRARY SYSTEM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA TO AID SERVICES IN
TERMS OF STOCK, ECONOMICS, AND MANPOWER.
MATCHING COMMITMENTS TO NEEDS AND RESOURCES.

REVISED VERSION OF A LECTURE GIVEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE LIBRARY, 29
APR 80. OFFERS PRACTICAL ADVICE TO LIBRARIANS ON MANAGING LIBRARIES DURING A
TIME OF DECLINING RESOURCES. URGES LIBRARIANS TO PUT ASIDE THE EXTRAVAGANT
PROMISES AND EMPTY RHETORIC THAT CHARACTERISED THE 1960S AND 1970S AND TO TAKE
A MORE REALISTIC VIEW OF THE COLLECTIONS AND SERVICES THEY CAN PROVIDE TO
THEIR USERS DURING THE AUSTERE 1980S.
BUDGET CUTS AND UNCERTAINTIES FOR US LIBRARIES.

THE US FEDERAL PROGRAMMES DIRECTLY AFFECTING LIBRARIES, IN PARTICULAR SCHOOL,
COLLEGE AND PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, ARE SUFFERING SEVERE CUTS AND
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE REAGAN BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1982. PRESENTS A GENERAL
REVIEW OF THE 1982 BUDGET AND ITS EFFECTS ON LIBRARIES, AND REPRINTS A LIST OF
LIBRARY PROGRAMMES WITH THEIR PAST AND PROPOSED FUNDING LEVELS FROM LIBR. J.
A FEW CONSIDERATIONS ON LIBRARY AUTOMATION.

THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED.
CONCLUDES THAT THERE ARE REAL GAINS FOR USERS BUT THAT AUTOMATION WILL NOT
SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS. AUTOMATION SHOULD RELEASE QUALIFIED STAFF FROM ROUTINE
WORK AND GIVE THEM MORE TIME FOR SPECIALISED WORK.
THE COMPUTERISED LIBRARY AS A WORKING MILIEU.

NO DANISH LIBRARY IS YET FULLY COMPUTERISED, THOUGH INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE IN
OPERATION. SPECIALISED EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN-SERVICE COURSES, IS NECESSARY,
BUT LIBRARIANS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT COMPUTERISATION MAY STEM FROM SEVERAL
PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS NOT YET FULLY EXPLORED. STAFF MAY FEEL
RULED BY THE MACHINE UNLESS ENCOURAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM THOROUGHLY AND
TAKE PART IN ORGANISING WORK PROCESSES. IN SETTING UP SAMKAT AT THE DANISH
NATIONAL LIBRARY, CATALOGUERS HAVE BEEN FULLY INVOLVED IN THE 1ST
(CATALOGUING) STAGE, AND WILL TAKE PART IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM TO
ENSURE CONSISTENCY. WHEN STAFF FEEL AT EASE WITH THE COMPUTER, ITS ADVANTAGES
INCLUDE MAKING THEIR WORK LESS STRENUOUS BUT MORE STIMULATING (PROVIDED
GOOD-QUALITY PRINT-OUTS ARE ATTAINED) AND IMPROVING INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND SERVICE TO READERS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WORKING
CONDITIONS, AND INTRODUCE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPME NTS AT A SUITABLE TEMPO.
APPLICATION OF COMPUTERS: A CHALLENGE FOR CHANGE.

DESCRIBES THE REASONS FOR USING COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES; IDENTIFIES AREAS FOR
COMPUTER APPLICATIONS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INFORMATION AND REFERENCE
SERVICES; DESCRIBES THE INFORMATION SYSTEM LIKELY TO EXIST IN 2000AD;
ENUMERATES ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN INDIA; AND
PLEADS FOR GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF LIBRARIANS IN THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY.
SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT-TECHNIQUE AND TECHNOLOGY.

FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE 5 ARTICLES IN THIS THEMATIC SECTION, SEE THE FOLLOWING
SERIAL NUMBERS:.
LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS IN TRANSITION: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE 1980'S.

LIBRARIANS HAVE LEARNT THAT AUTOMATION IS MORE DIFFICULT AND WILL TAKE LONGER
THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT; SOME FUNCTIONS ARE BETTER CARRIED OUT THROUGH
NETWORKS; ALTHOUGH COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS ARE MORE POWERFUL AND MORE VERSATILE
THAN THE MANUAL SYSTEMS THEY REPLACE, THEY CAN ALSO BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO
OPERATE AND MAINTAIN (AT LEAST DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD); AND
COMPUTERISATION IMPOSES MUCH HIGHER STANDARDS OF ACCURACY ON LIBRARY
OPERATIONS. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS DURING
THE NEXT DECADE AND SUGGESTS THAT THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES GROUP, INC. (A
GROWING PARTNERSHIP OF 25 LIBRARIES TRYING TO COLLECTIVELY MAINTAIN AND EXPAND
THEIR CAPABILITIES USING NEW TECHNOLOGY EVEN IN THE FACE OF DIMINISHING
RESOURCES) COULD SERVE AS A MODEL AND INSPIRATION FOR OTHER GROUPS WORLDWIDE.
GEAC.

DESCRIBES THE WORK OF GEAC CANADA CO. LTD., ON-LINE SYSTEM SUPPLIER TO RETAIL
AND COMMERCIAL BANKING, PHARMACEUTICAL PRESCRIPTION SERVICES, AND WORD
PROCESSING, AS WELL AS LIBRARY CIRCULATION. REVIEWS GEAC'S HARDWARE,
INSTALLATIONS, SOFTWARE, AND OTHER FUNCTIONS, WITH A SECTION ON SEARCHING
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND PATRON DATA BASES.
MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

THE MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT JUST A SIMPLER VERSION OF THE
MINI AND MAINFRAME. IT IS ONLY CHEAPER BECAUSE LESS IS PROVIDED, THE
FACILITIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR MANY OPERATIONS, AND IF SIGNIFICANT ONCE-OFF
PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED, MOST COST ADVANTAGES OF A MICRO SYSTEM MAY
BE LOST. DISCUSSES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RAISED WHEN CONSIDERING MICRO
COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL. SUGGESTS THAT PROCESSOR, MEMORY AND LOGIC BOARDS SHOULD COST NO
MORE THAN *62,000, AND MASS STORAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO FLOPPY DISCS AND/OR
CASSETTE.
THE ROLE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES.

RECENT ADVANTAGES IN LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND
ATTENDANT ADVANCES IN MASS STORAGE TECHNOLOGY OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OF
AUTOMATION FOR MANY SMALL LIBRARIES THAT UP UNTIL NOW COULD NOT AFFORD TO
AUTOMATE. COMPUTERS ARE ALSO FINDING A PLACE IN LIBRARIES AS A NEW KIND OF
MEDIA, PURCHASED FOR USE BY THEIR PATRONS. EXAMINES THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL
APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES, BOTH IN TECHNICAL
SERVICES/LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND IN PUBLIC SERVICES AS A NEW FORM OF MEDIA.
MICROCOMPUTERS OR WORD PROCESSORS IN THE LIBRARY?.

DESCRIBES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MICROCOMPUTERS AND WORD PROCESSORS, THEIR
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, EXISTING LIBRARY APPLICATIONS, AND POSSIBLE
FURTHER APPLICATIONS.
THE PERSONALITY OF THE LIBRARIAN.

DESCRIBES THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PERSONALITY OF A LIBRARIAN; THE
ESSENCE OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IS SERVICE WHICH IS UNCHANGED BY TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES.
THE LIBRARY TECHNICIAN AND THE DOCUMENTATION TECHNICIAN: TWELVE YEARS LATER.

COMPARES THE RESULTS OF A 1980 QUEBEC SURVEY OF DOCUMENTATION TECHNICIANS WITH
A 1975 SURVEY OF LIBRARY TECHNICIANS, TO ASSESS THE CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE
INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW QUALIFICATION. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT WHILE NEW
RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN CREATED, THERE ARE STILL NO REAL CAREER
OPPORTUNITIES FOR NON-PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY STAFF.
TRAINING FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE CHANGING JOB MARKET FACING CANADIAN LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES
(MORE ARE TAKING JOBS IN NON-TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SETTINGS; POSITIONS IN PUBLIC
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE ON THE DECLINE) AND THE ADAPTATION OF LIBRARY SCIENCE
PROGRAMMES IN RESPONSE TO THIS.
SURVEYS OF LIBRARIANS' BENEFITS: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY.

THIS ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY CITES 39 REPORTS ON ACADEMIC, RESEARCH, AND PUBLIC
LIBRARY CONDITIONS. A COPY OF EVERY ITEM IS AVAILABLE ON LOAN FROM THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. WHERE AVAILABLE, EACH ITEM CONTAINS DETAILS OF
ITS AVAILABILITY FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OR OTHER HOLDING AGENCY. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
JOB PERMANENCY: THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN'S DILEMMA IS THE ADMINISTRATOR'S
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1980S.

THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IS BECOMING A NO-MOVEMENT, STABLE FACULTY WITH EVERYONE
AFRAID, FINANCIALLY UNABLE, OR PROFESSIONALLY INCAPABLE OF MOVING. THE LIBRARY
MANAGER COULD STOP THE FACULTY DYING AND HELP STAFF TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONALLY
BY PROVIDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGING STAFFING PATTERNS, ROTATING PERSONNEL,
OFFERING LEAVE OF ABSENCE, AND IMPROVING THE WORK ENVIRONMENT.
THE SCHEDULING OF WORK.

NOTES THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF SHIFT WORK, 4-DAY WORKING WEEKS, AND
FLEXIBLE WORKING HOURS IN US ORGANISATIONS. DISCUSSES EACH OF THESE VARIATIONS
IN THE TRADITIONAL WORKING WEEK, AND EXAMINES THEIR ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH ORGANISATIONS SHOULD APPROACH A CHANGE
IN THEIR WORK SCHEDULE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO EASE ITS ACCEPTANCE, AND ENSURE THAT
THE CONTEMPLATED CHANGE IS RIGHT FOR THEM AND THEIR EMPLOYEES.
MOTIVATING EMPLOYEES.

FOR MANY YEARS RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN STUDYING,
TESTING, THEORISING AND WRITING ABOUT JOB MOTIVATION, ITS CAUSES AND EFFECTS.
JOB MOTIVATION, WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT DIRECTED TOWARD ATTAINING GOALS
DESIRED BY THE ORGANISATION, IS A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH ALL MANAGERS OF PEOPLE,
INCLUDING LIBRARIANS, MUST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE.
MOTIVATION AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.

ARGUES THAT STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES DO NOT, IN THEMSELVES,
MOTIVATE STAFF. THEY ARE SEEN AS BEING CATALYTIC IN NATURE, NEEDING TO BE
UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF ADULT LEARNING AND MOTIVATION THEORY. SUGGESTS
WAYS OF BRINGING ABOUT A RENAISSANCE IN THE LIBRARY AS A WORKPLACE WHICH WOULD
BRING THE 'QUALITY OF WORK LIFE' MOVEMENT TO LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES MANAGERS'
AND NON-MANAGERS' ROLES, RELATIONSHIPS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE CREATION
OF AN ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE TO GROWTH, IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
A CONSUMER'S GUIDE TO STAFF DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES.

SEES STAFF DEVELOPMENT AS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ENHANCING THE CAPABILITIES AND
CAREERS OF LIBRARY PERSONNEL, AND PRESENTS A STRUCTURE FOR VIEWING STAFF
DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. PROPOSES GUIDELINES FOR: IDENTIFYING, SELECTING AND
LOCATING THE STAFF DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES NEEDED; CONSIDERING VIABLE
ALTERNATIVES; AND MANAGING RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINED USE.
A MODEL FOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT.

DEFINES THE PURPOSE OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT AS BEING TO INCREASE AN
ORGANISATION'S CAPACITY TO ATTAIN ITS GOALS, AND DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF THE
BENEFITS OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT, BOTH TO INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANISATIONS. PRESENTS
A MODEL OF THE STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, AND DISCUSSES THE FOLLOWING
IMPORTANT STEPS INVOLVED: NEEDS ANALYSIS; OBJECTIVES; CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION;
CLIMATE ANALYSIS; CLIMATE CONDITIONING; DEVELOPING CONTENT AND METHODS; AND
IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION. PROVIDES A CASE STUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF THE
STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN A LIBRARY SETTING.
TRAINING WITHOUT EDUCATION: A LOST CAUSE.

FORMAL AND ONGOING TRAINING OF COMPUTER SEARCHERS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE
SUCCESS OF ANY COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICE. ARGUES THAT ALL LIBRARY STAFF
SHOULD BE EDUCATED IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS FOR REFERENCE WORK SO THAT COMPUTER
SEARCHING CAN BE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE NORMAL EVERYDAY SERVICE. LIBRARIES
MUST NOT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE FAILED IF THEY DECIDE TO ASK FOR A COMPUTER
SEARCH RATHER THAN HUNT THROUGH BOOKS FOR THEMSELVES. BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE
ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE ACCESS TO REFERENCE BOOKS AND INDEXES TO POPULAR
PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS.
PHILOSOPHER AND LIBRARIAN SIDE BY SIDE.

THE HISTORY OF LIBRARIANSHIP REVEALS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LIBRARIANS WHO
HAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVE AS PHILOSOPHERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LIBRARIAN AND
THE PHILOSOPHER MUST SHARE A NUMBER OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. THE MOST
STRIKING OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE UNBOUNDED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. IN
ADDITION, ALTHOUGH COURSES OF STUDY ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, THE
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF BOTH LIBRARIAN AND PHILOSOPHER IS ONLY ACQUIRED
AFTER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. BOTH GROUPS SEEK TO CREATE ORDER IN THE MATERIAL
WHICH FORMS THE FOCUS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND ALTHOUGH NOT INNOVATORS
THEMSELVES, WILLINGLY OFFER THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS.
A STUDY OF AGE AND TENURE AS IT PERTAINS TO JOB SATISFACTION.

NOTES THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING JOB SATISFACTION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF
LIBRARIANSHIP, AND EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP OF AGE AND TENURE TO THE JOB
SATISFACTION OF LIBRARIANS. REVIEWS SOME LIBRARY LITERATURE ON MANAGEMENT, AND
DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE FINDINGS OF 5 EMPIRICAL STUDIES CONCERNED WITH THE JOB
SATISFACTION OF LIBRARY EMPLOYEES. DESCRIBES THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF AN
EMPIRICAL STUDY DESIGNED TO ANALYSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE, TENURE, AND
JOB SATISFACTION FOR 64 US PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT
THE LIBRARIANS STUDIED EXPERIENCED RELATIVELY CONSTANT LEVELS OF JOB
SATISFACTION ACROSS 3 DIFFERENT AGE AND TENURE CATEGORIES. THE PRIMARY JOB
DISSATISFACTION NOTED RELATED TO AGE AND SATISFACTION WITH SUPERVISION AND
CO-WORKERS.
ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA
OF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS IS
NOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THE
ARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.
IS A FITTED CARPET HARMFUL TO ALLERGIC PEOPLE?.

FITTED CARPETS HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY CUT DOWN NOISE.
BUT IF CARPETS ARE NOT KEPT CLEAN AND ROOMS WELL VENTILATED THEY CAN CAUSE
PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. NEW CARPETS DO NOT
CAUSE THIS TROUBLE. RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND SHOWS THAT CARPETS STAY
DIRTY EVEN AFTER GOOD VACUUMING. GIVES COMPARATIVE FIGURES FOR THE AMOUNT OF
DUST CAUSED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOOR COVERINGS, WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES THE
ALLERGIES.
LITERATURE SURVEY ON LIBRARY BUILDING 1979.

CONTINUATION OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY PUBLISHED AT INTERVALS IN THIS PERIODICAL
SINCE 1969. ABOUT 180 ITEMS ARE LISTED, INCLUDING BOOKS, CONFERENCE

AND MATERIALS.
DID THE NEW BUILDING COME UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STAFF?.

ALL THE LIBRARY DEPARTMENTS OF THE NEW JYVASKYLA CENTRAL LIBRARY, FINLAND, ARE
AT THE SAME LEVEL. DUE TO THE OPENNESS OF THE BUILDING GUIDING IS EASIER, BUT
THIS OPEN PLAN ALSO EXAGGERATES NOISE. THE NEW BUILDING HAS BROUGHT MORE
CUSTOMERS TO THE LIBRARY BECAUSE IT IS LARGE AND MULTI-PURPOSE. ON THE WHOLE
THE STAFF IS VERY PLEASED WITH THE GENERAL DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. INCLUDES
PLANS OF THE 4 FLOORS OF THE BUILDING.
INDOOR MARKET AS A MODEL FOR A LIBRARY.

THE NEW MAIN LIBRARY OF JYVASKYLA SERVES A POPULATION OF 24,000. THE
POPULATION OF THE WHOLE OF THE CITY IS ABOUT 63,000. THE BUILDING HAS A FLOOR
AREA OF 6,660 M2. THE LIBRARY HAS 200,000 BOOKS, 6,900 GRAMOPHONE RECORDS,
1,400 CASSETTES, NEWSPAPER AND PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTIONS OF 330 AND A STAFF OF
22. THE BUILDING WAS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC IN JULY 80. THIS CULTURAL CENTRE
INCLUDES A LIBRARY, A WORKER'S INSTITUTE, AND A CENTRE FOR CULTURAL
ADMINISTRATION. THE ENTRANCE HALL AND OTHER PUBLIC AREAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR
ARE USED BY GENERAL PUBLIC VISITING THE ABOVE FACILITIES, BUT THE LIBRARY
AREAS ARE SITUATED ON THE FLOORS ABOVE. DIFFERENT LIBRARY DEPARTMENTS ARE
SITUATED IN SEPARATE BUILDINGS AROUND THE INDOOR MARKET PLACE, CONNECTED BY
MAIN ROADS.
KUUSAMO CASTLE OF BOOKS.

THE DESIGN OF THE KUUSAMO MAIN LIBRARY BUILDING WAS GREATLY INFLUENCED BY THE
FACT THAT IT WAS TO FORM AN ORGANIC PART OF THE PLANNED ADMINISTRATIVE AND
CULTURAL CENTRE OF THE TOWN. THE POPULATION OF KUUSAMO IS ABOUT 17,000. THERE
ARE 5 BRANCH LIBRARIES, 1 INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARY, AND 3 BOOK MOBILES. THE
BUILDING INCLUDES ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES OF THE LOCAL WORKERS' INSTITUTE AND
OF A MUSIC COLLEGE. THE MAIN LIBRARY SERVES 7,800 INHABITANTS. IT HAS A FLOOR

REPORT ON NEW ACADEMIC LIBRARY BUILDING AND REMODELLING PROJECTS IN THE USA,
CANADA AND ENGLAND, WITH COMMENTARIES BY LIBRARY DIRECTORS AND ARCHITECTS,
INCLUDING DATA ON EQUIPMENT, FURNISHINGS AND MATERIALS.
ENERGY REGULATIONS FOR LIBRARIES, TOO?.

IN 1979, THE US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ANNOUNCED THAT PUBLIC HEARINGS ON
REGULATIONS FOR EMERGENCY BUILDING TEMPERATURE RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE HELD IN 5
PRINCIPAL CITIES, AND IN RESPONSE, VARIOUS MAJOR ASSOCIATIONS CONSULTED AT
LENGTH ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE REGULATIONS AND TESTIFIED TO THE DEPARTMENT.
THE DEPARTMENT WAS URGED TO EXEMPT MUSEUMS, ARCHIVES, RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND
HISTORIC STRUCTURES WHERE THE PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC HERITAGE
REQUIRES SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE AND/OR RELATIVE HUMIDITY LEVELS. DESCRIBES THE
LIBRARIANS' ATTEMPTS TO CONFORM TO THE FLEXIBLE PROVISIONS, AND THEIR EFFORTS
TO OBTAIN EXEMPTIONS TO THE PROGRAMME.
RESEARCH STUDY ACCOMMODATION FROM THE USER'S POINT OF VIEW.

THE IDEAL RESEARCH STUDY IS SITUATED CLOSE TO THE REFERENCE FACILITIES, BUT
WITH A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FROM A CORRIDOR. IT SHOULD HAVE A WINDOW, A LARGE
DESK, A SEPARATE DESK FOR TYPING, PLENTY OF SHELVES AND DRAWERS, AND IT SHOULD
BE AVAILABLE FOR USE FROM 8 AM TO 8 PM. BOTH PUBLIC AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE RESEARCH STUDIES AVAILABLE FOR USE IN FINLAND. THEY CAN BE BOOKED FROM 2
WEEKS TO 1/2 A YEAR DEPENDING ON THE LIBRARY AND THE TYPE OF STUDY UNDERTAKEN
BY THE USER.
HEADPHONES FOR LIBRARY AND EDUCATIONAL USE.

REVIEW OF THE CURRENT MANUFACTURE AND LIBRARY AND EDUCATIONAL USE OF

PHOTOGRAPHS, A LIST OF LIBRARY USERS, AND A SYNOPSIS OF USERS' EXPERIENCE; AND
(3) SITE VISITS TO LIBRARIES WITH COMPACT SHELVING INSTALLATIONS.
LANCASHIRE'S NEW MOBILE LIBRARIES.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES NEW MOBILE LIBRARIES DEVELOPED BY LANCASHIRE LIBRARIES FOR
USE IN RURAL AREAS. FORD 'A' D510 VANS FITTED WITH HAWSON GARNER 'CLEARLOAD'
INTEGRAL BODIES HAVE BEEN USED, WHICH CAN CARRY 1,900 BOOKS EACH.
DESIGNING LIBRARIES TO SELL SERVICES.

DISCUSSES HOW LIBRARIES CAN BE DESIGNED TO CREATE AN AMBIENCE WHICH APPEALS TO
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO INSURE CROSS-SECTION SUPPORT IN THE RECESSION.
DESCRIBES: HOW TO USE ENTRANCES TO ATTRACT POTENTIAL USERS; HOW TO USE SPACE
EFFECTIVELY; HOW TO CREATE ASSIGNABLE SPACE; COMFORTABLE SEATING; AVOIDING
CROWDING AND BARRIERS; FLEXIBLE DESIGN FOR TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. AS EXCESS
SPACE, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS, BECOMES AVAILABLE, IT
SHOULD BE USED FOR NONTRADITIONAL PURPOSES TO ATTRACT NEW USERS.
HOW TO PROMOTE SERVICES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES (IN ARABIC).

LISTS SOME OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE DO NOT MAKE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES, AND EMPHASISES THE NEED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO SO BY, FOR
EXAMPLE, PLANNING BOOK EXHIBITIONS, FILM REVIEWS, AND RECORDINGS OF READINGS.
SUCH PROGRAMMES SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS, COLLEGES, MUSEUMS AND
LIBRARY SCIENCE STUDENTS.
PUBLIC AWARENESS IN RURAL LIBRARIES.

INCREASING THE PUBLIC'S AWARENESS OF A LIBRARY'S EXISTENCE AND SERVICES IS
VITAL IN ANY LIBRARY COMMUNITY. IN US RURAL AREAS THERE ARE MANY MEANS OF
COMMUNICATION AT THE LIBRARIAN'S DISPOSAL, INCLUDING THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER,
LOCAL RADIO, WORD-OF-MOUTH COMMUNICATIONS BY LIBRARY STAFF, THE COUNTY BOARD
OF EDUCATION, AND SERVICE CLUBS. ONLY THROUGH COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC
CAN THE RURAL PUBLIC LIBRARY INCREASE ITS CIRCULATION AND FUNDING.
THE TEACHER'S ROLE IN LIBRARY USAGE.

TEACHERS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PROMOTING LIBRARY USAGE. IT IS FOR THE
TEACHERS TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CULTIVATING THE READING HABIT, BY GIVING STUDENTS
LIBRARY ASSIGNMENTS TO MOTIVATE THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY. THE ROLE OF THE
TEACHER AND THAT OF THE LIBRARIAN ARE CLOSELY RELATED, AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR
THE TEACHER TO KNOW THE LIBRARIAN'S JOB AND PROMOTE LIBRARY USAGE.
GUIDE TO SOURCES: COMMUNICATIONS AND RHETORIC, COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,
ECONOMICS, FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE, SOCIAL WELFARE, AND INFORMATION ON WOMEN.

6 LIBRARY GUIDES, DESIGNED TO INTRODUCE THE STUDENT TO SOME OF THE

RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC TOPIC BEING PRESENTED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR LIBRARY': A REPORT OF A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN IN BURY,
LANCASHIRE.D

ESCRIBES A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN BY BURY LIBRARIES (UK) 'TO BRING BEFORE THE
PUBLIC THE IDEAS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT CENTRES IN THE COMMUNITY
AND HAVE A MUCH WIDER ROLE THAN IS COMMONLY THOUGHT'. POSTERS AND HANDOUTS
FORMED THE BASIS OF THE MONTH-LONG CAMPAIGN, PLUS NEWSPAPER ARTICLES, ALTHOUGH
THESE WERE LIMITED BY A PRINTING STRIKE. THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING INTO SHOPPING
CENTRES WAS VERY USEFUL.
ARCHIVE EXHIBITIONS: ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS.

A DISCUSSION OF THE MOST FREQUENT PROBLEMS, OFFERING GUIDELINES BASED ON 10
YEARS EXPERIENCE AT THE MUSEE DE L'HISTOIRE DE FRANCE, THE PERMANENT MUSEUM OF
THE FRENCH NATIONAL ARCHIVES, WHICH ORGANISES EXHIBITIONS OF ALL KINDS. THE
ADVICE GIVEN COVERS TRANSPORT AND INSURANCE; EXHIBITION TECHNIQUES; LABELLING;
POSTERS AND CATALOGUES; SECURITY; REGULATION OF ENTRANCE; RECEPTION OF GROUP
VISITS; AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. FURTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE CITED. IN
GENERAL, THE ORGANISATION OF AN EXHIBITION IS A MATTER OF SCALING DOWN
AMBITIONS TO WHAT THE PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES PERMIT.
STATISTICAL INDICES SYSTEMS AS A BASIS FOR EVALUATION OF THE WORK OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRES.

2 SYSTEMS OF STATISTICAL INDICES FOR EVALUATION OF INFORMATION WORK ARE
PRESENTED: SYSTEM OF PRIMARY INDICES FOR QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL
INFORMATION TASKS; AND SYSTEM OF 'RELATIVE' INDICES WHICH EXPRESS THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PARAMETERS AND WHICH CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMATION SERVICES AND TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF WORK
UNDERTAKEN BY INFORMATION WORKERS; THE SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO CARRY OUT
COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF THE ACTIVITIES OF INFORMATION CENTRES. USING THESE 2
SYSTEMS, A COMPLEX METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF THE WORK OF BRANCH INFORMATION
CENTRES WAS DEVELOPED. THE METHOD EMPLOYS AN ALGORITHM DESIGNED BY THE
COMPUTING CENTRE OF THE SIBERIAN BRANCH OF THE USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. THE
METHOD WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE WORK OF 33 BRANCH INFORMATION CENTRES; RESULTS
OF THE EVALUATION ARE PRESENTED.
INFORMATION SERVICES IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES: WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE
LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BAGHDAD.

(MLS DISSERTATION.) DISCUSSES METHODS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND CURRENT
AWARENESS SERVICES IN IRAQI UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, AND THEIR APPLICATIONS TO
THE UNIVERSITY OF BAGHDAD. THERE IS A NEED TO CREATE A NEW IMAGE OF THE
LIBRARY AMONGST BAGHDAD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY USERS. SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR
RESEARCH INTO THE CURRENT USE OF BAGHDAD LIBRARIES AND THE REAL INFORMATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY'S STAFF AND STUDENTS.
NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE FOR INDUSTRIES IN UGANDA.

DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF INDUSTRY IN UGANDA, AND
OUTLINES THE WORK OF THE FOLLOWING AGENCIES WHICH PROVIDE INFORMATION SERVICES
FOR INDUSTRY: UGANDA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION; UGANDA TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SERVICE; THE BANKS; COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND MARKETING BOARDS; UGANDA
ADVISORY BOARD OF TRADE. HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A CENTRAL BODY RESPONSIBLE
FOR COORDINATING THE EFFORTS OF THESE ORGANISATIONS TO ENSURE THAT A FLOW OF
INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL INTERESTED IN INDUSTRIAL
ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTRY. DISCUSSES THE REQUIREMENTS OF A NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL
INFORMATION SERVICE, AND SUGGESTS THE ESTABLISHMENT, UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE, OF A UGANDA NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY INFORMATION
AND ADVISORY SERVICE (UNILIAS).
THE INDUSTRIAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE IN IRAQ.

THE NORWEGIAN CENTRE FOR INFORMATION HAS, TOGETHER WITH A/S COMPUTERS, CARRIED
OUT A STUDY OF THE NEED, OPERATION, AND USE OF AN INDUSTRIAL DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE IN BAGHDAD.
SECTION DEVOTED TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SOURCES FOR NURSES).2

 ARTICLES WRITTEN IN RESPONSE TO A RECENT CRITICISM OF THE SCARCITY OF LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR NURSES IN THE UK. THEY ARE: SOURCES AND
RESOURCES, BY SENGA BOND, WHICH PRESENTS A STATE OF THE ART REVIEW OF EXISTING
SERVICES; AND INFORMATION PLEASE! BY BRYN DAVIS, WHICH DISCUSSES THE WORK OF
THE STUDY GROUP ON INFORMATION FOR NURSES, AND A 1978 CONFERENCE INVOLVING
NURSES AND GNC REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH LED TO ATTEMPTS TO TACKLE INFORMATION
DIFFICULTIES.
UNISIST GUIDELINES FOR THE CONDUCT OF USER STUDIES.

THE SURVEY METHODOLOGY OUTLINED IN THESE GUIDELINES IS AIMED AT HELPING THE
PROFESSIONAL PLANNER IN A DEVELOPING NATION TO ANTICIPATE USER INFORMATION
NEEDS FOR THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR
CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY. PART OF THE INITIAL PLANNING AND DESIGN OF
A NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, SUCH A SURVEY MUST BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE USER
GROUPS, AS WELL AS TO DISCOVER THE PARTICULAR TYPES OF MATERIALS AND RESOURCES
THAT ARE MOST SUITABLE AND HOW THEY COULD BE ASSEMBLED AND ORGANISED. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
GOVERNMENT AND COLLEAGUES.

THE COMMITTEE OF DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIANS, A CONSULTATIVE AND COORDINATING BODY
CONSISTING OF THE CHIEF LIBRARIANS OF THE CENTRAL (UK) GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS,
SET UP A SUB-COMMITTEE IN APR 79, TO CONSIDER WAYS OF DISSEMINATING
INFORMATION ON THE NON-HMSO PUBLICATIONS OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. DESCRIBES
THE WORK OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE, AND PROVIDES ADDRESSES FOR CONTACT.
LIBRARIES' ROLE IN INFORMATION ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1945, SERIOUS EFFORTS 1ST BEGAN TO
DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE UNITED NATIONS HAS OVER
300 DEPOT LIBRARIES, 14 OF THEM IN SCANDINAVIA. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AGENCIES EXIST IN ALL 5 SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES INFORMATION
IS AVAILABLE FROM THESE AGENCIES, BUT IN OTHERS ONLY FROM NON-GOVERNMENT
ORGANISATIONS. SPECIAL LIBRARIES EXIST IN SEVERAL SCANDINAVIAN INSTITUTIONS,
RESEARCH BEING PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED ON AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE SPECIALISED RESEARCH INSTITUTES. SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION MUST BE SOUGHT IN LARGE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND
FROM LOCAL HUMANITARIAN, POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS. A
PAN-SCANDINAVIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY OF RELEVANT DATA BASES WOULD BE VALUABLE.
LIBRARIANS RECOGNISE A NEED FOR BETTER ORGANISED DOCUMENTATION; LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS IN DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN HAVE ESTABLISH ED COMMITTEES OF
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SCANDINAVIAN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL COMMITTEES ON THESE
LINES ARE DESIRABLE TO COORDINATE ACCESSIONS AND ESTABLISH AREA AND SUBJECT
SPECIALISATION PLANS.
A NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR ARCHIVES AND MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS.

DISCUSSES SOME IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR ARCHIVES AND MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS IN THE
USA. THESE INCLUDE: THE IDENTIFICATION OF USERS AND POTENTIAL USERS; AND THE
APPROACH OF THESE USERS TO THE COLLECTION; STANDARDISATION OF ENTRIES; AND
SUBJECT ACCESS. CONSIDERS BRIEFLY SOME PROBLEMS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND
PLANNING OF THIS NATIONAL SYSTEM, AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE ARCHIVAL
PROFESSION IN ITS DESIGN.
BRINGING THE PATENT FAMILY TOGETHER AND OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES AT THE
INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION CENTER (INPADOC).

THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION CENTER (INPADOC) WAS FOUNDED IN 1972.
IT GATHERS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA FOR PATENT DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED BY 46 COUNTRIES,
BY THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE, AND UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY. ITS 3
DATA BASES (1968-72, 1973-77, AND 1978-) CONTAIN DETAILS OF OVER 6 MILLION
DOCUMENTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT SERVICES (ON MICROFILM, SUBSCRIBED TO ON AN
ANNUAL BASIS) ARE THE PATENT FAMILY, PATENT CLASSIFICATION, PATENT APPLICANT,
PATENT INVENTOR, AND NUMERICAL DATA BASE SERVICES. THE PATENT FAMILY FILE IS
ALSO AVAILABLE ON-LINE. A DATA BASE ON LEGAL STATUS WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE ON
COM AND ON-LINE. TAPE, COPYING, STATISTICAL, AND PERSONAL ENQUIRY SERVICES ARE
OFFERED. AN SDI SERVICE IS PLANNED.
PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES.

UNTIL WELL INTO THE 70S TRADITIONAL INFORMATION CHANNELS WERE USED WHEN
DEALING WITH INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE EXPANSION OF RESEARCH IN
THE AREA NECESSITATED MORE PLANNED INFORMATION SERVICES. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT
OF THESES IS DUE TO THE LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES, TO THE SPECIAL NATURE OF
SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE NEEDS OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION OUTSIDE
THEIR FIELD, TO THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO USE INFORMATION
SERVICES, AND TO THE LACK OF STANDARDISED TERMINOLOGY IN THE FIELD.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES.

MANY INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN DEVELOPING AND
COORDINATING INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. SOME OF THESE
ORGANISATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED METHODS, AND PARTICULAR TERMINOLOGY. THERE IS NO
ESTABLISHED DIVISION OF WORK BETWEEN THESE ORGANISATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CAN BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THE MORE MECHANICAL THIS EXCHANGE IS THE MORE ECONOMICAL
AND FASTER IT WILL BE. UNISIST NOW ALSO COVERS SOCIAL SCIENCES. A PLAN
PUBLISHED IN 1972 INCLUDES UNESCO'S PROGRAMME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. UNESCO ALSO SUPPORTS FINANCIALLY SOME
PROJECTS IN THE FIELD, INCLUDING ECSSID PROGRAMME. IN 1975 OECD MAPPED THE
AVAILABLE INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE FIELD IN EUROPE. BETWEEN 1971 AND 1980
THE BRITISH DISISS PROJECT LOOKED AT THE INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL
SCIENCES AND THEIR QUALITY. BOTH PROJECTS CONCLUDED  THAT INFORMATION SERVICES
HAVE DEVELOPED WITHOUT ANY GENERAL LONG-TERM PLAN. 2 RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE
FIELD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN FINLAND.
MAKING ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC-A REVIEW OF THE OUTER
CONTINENTAL SHELF PROGRAM, WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS.

A REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT, WHICH
REQUIRES FEDERAL AGENCIES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, TO MAKE AVAILABLE
TO STATES, COUNTIES, MUNICIPALITIES, INSTITUTIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS, ADVICE AND
INFORMATION USEFUL IN RESTORING, MAINTAINING, AND ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF THE
ENVIRONMENT.

POPIN: AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK FOR THE POPULATION FIELD.

(NOTE. ORIGINAL PRESENTATION IN FRENCH; ENGLISH VERSION PUBLISHED AT AUTHOR'S
REQUEST.) THE INTERNATIONAL POPULATION INFORMATION NETWORK (POPIN) IS BEING
ESTABLISHED IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH
INFORMATION, THE DESIRE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE NEED TO TIE TOGETHER ISOLATED ACTIVITIES TO MAXIMISE
BENEFITS. IT IS DEVELOPING AS A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL OPERATION WITH
ACTIVITIES INTEGRATED THROUGH A CENTRAL COORDINATING UNIT. THE 1ST MEETING OF
THE POPIN ADVISORY GROUP (SCHEDULED FOR EARLY 1980) WAS TO DISCUSS WAYS OF
IMPROVING INTERCONNECTIONS AMONG EXISTING POPULATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS;
RESOLVE PROBLEMS OF STANDARDISATION, UNIFORMITY, AND COORDINATION; AND REACH A
CONSENSUS ON THE NETWORK'S OPERATION.
LIBRARY AS A MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRE.

A SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SWEDEN SHOWS THAT MOST LIBRARIES
OBTAIN MATERIALS AND INFORMATION CONCERNING LOCAL GOVERNMENT MATTERS.
POLITICAL PARTIES AND LOCAL ORGANISATIONS ARE NOT USING LIBRARIES TO DISPLAY
INFORMATION. LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE PASSIVE ABOUT ACQUIRING ANY MATERIALS
ON LOCAL AFFAIRS. ONLY 14% OF THEM HAD CONTACTS WITH SOME LOCAL ORGANISATIONS.
ONLY 19 LIBRARIES MADE DISPLAYS OF LOCAL INFORMATION. THERE IS A NEED TO
DEVELOP THE PROVISION OF LOCAL INFORMATION IN LIBRARIES.
NATIONAL EDUCATION PRACTICES FILE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. PROCEDURES
DOCUMENTATION. PRODUCT 2.1.

OVERVIEW OF ERIC, THE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES INFORMATION CENTER (FORMERLY
'CLEARINGHOUSE'.) CENTRAL ERIC COLLECTS RESEARCH REPORTS FROM GOVERNMENT
SPONSORED EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES, TEXTBOOK
PUBLISHERS, AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS. IT ALSO CONDUCTS AND SPONSORS
RESEARCH, PLANS AND DIRECTS ACTIVITIES OF THE SYSTEM, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE
OTHER COMPONENTS. A CLEARINGHOUSE WAS CONTRACTED FOR EACH OF A NUMBER OF MAJOR
EDUCATIONAL TOPICS. REVIEWS THE ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING SERVICES OF ERIC AND
PROVIDES ADDRESSES OF ERIC CLEARINGHOUSES ORGANISED ALPHABETICALLY BY SUBJECT.
AT THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES.

THE FINANCIAL TIMES BUSINESS INFORMATION SERVICE, A NATURAL OFF-SHOOT OF THE
UK NEWSPAPER FINANCIAL TIMES, WAS STARTED IN 1971. IT HAS FILES ON 60,000
COMPANIES, TRADE DIRECTORIES, EXTEL CARDS, INFORMATION ON REGISTERED US
COMPANIES, A FULL-TIME AGENT AT COMPANIES HOUSE, CUTTINGS ON 25,000 PROMINENT
PEOPLE, AND DETAILED ECONOMIC INFORMATION. THE MINIMUM SUBSCRIPTION IS *6250,
SOME USERS SPEND *610,000 ANNUALLY, AND ANNUAL REVENUE IS ALMOST *63 MILLION.
IT PUBLISHES INFORMATION SPIN-OFFS (NEWSLETTERS, REPORTS, AND DIRECTORIES) AND
HAS BOUGHT OUT AND ABSORBED A POTENTIAL COMPETITOR, MCCARTHY INFORMATION
SERVICES (A VERY UP-MARKET PRESS CUTTING SERVICE).
ISONET: AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR STANDARDS.

THESAURUS.
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES' ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS.

EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES IN
RELATION TO ORGANISATIONAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. DISCUSSION COVERS THE
FOLLOWING TOPICS: THE RELATIVELY WEAK ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION IN THE NEW INDUSTRY; THE DIVERSE NATURE OF POTENTIAL USERS; THE
EFFECTS ON INFORMATION ACCESS; INFORMATION SERVICES AS THE NEW MARKET WHERE
DATA BASES ARE SUBSIDIARY TOOLS; THE NECESSITY FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION;
GLOBAL AND LOCAL EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND PERSONNEL; THE LEGAL PROBLEMS OF
COPYRIGHT, INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE AND FREEDOM; OBJECTIVITY OF INFORMATION
CONTENT; AND THE CULTURAL IMPACT.
THE ROLE OF SPECIALIZED INFORMATION SERVICES IN DEVELOPMENT.

SPECIALISED INFORMATION CENTRES CLOSELY LINKED TO RESEARCH CENTRES OF
EXCELLENCE IN A GIVEN FIELD SEEM TO BE THE MOST VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE
INFORMATION EXPLOSION AS FAR AS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE CONCERNED. THEY
PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED INFORMATION, CAN REACH USERS RAPIDLY, AND ENABLE THEIR
TARGET SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO BEHAVE AS A HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CASSAVA
INFORMATION CENTRE AT THE CENTRO INTERNACIONAL DE AGRICULTURA TROPICAL, CALI,
COLOMBIA, PROVIDES CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION. INFORMATION IS SELECTED, ANALYSED
FOR RELIABILITY AND EQUALITY, AND FUSED INTO PUBLICATIONS SUCH AS MONOGRAPHS,
STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEWS, AND DIRECTORIES. IT ALSO PROVIDES AN ABSTRACTING
SERVICE. EMPHASIS IS ON SATISFYING USER NEEDS RATHER THAN ON THE TECHNIQUES
FOR DOING SO.
STANDARDISATION OF INFORMATION WORK AS A MEANS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE
ORGANISATION AND METHODOLOGY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
DEPARTMENTS.

1 OF THE TRENDS OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE USSR STATE SYSTEM OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION IS STANDARDISATION OF INFORMATION WORK
AND LIBRARY TASKS. APPROXIMATELY 50 STANDARDS ARE PLANNED TO BE PUBLISHED
WITHIN THE 11TH 5-YEAR PLAN. STANDARDS ARE BEING PREPARED BY A NUMBER OF
INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS ATTACHED TO ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND MANUFACTURING
COMPANIES, THUS THE PREPARATION OF STANDARDS IS NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENTLY
COORDINATED. AN ANALYSIS OF THE STANDARDISATION OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
INFORMATION WORK WAS THEREFORE CARRIED OUT. ITS RESULTS SHOW THAT IT IS
ESSENTIAL TO PREPARE AN UNIFIED PLAN OF STANDARDISATION COVERING ALL ASPECTS
OF INFORMATION WORK. METHODOLOGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS MUST BE PREPARED IN
COOPERATION WITH OFFICIAL BODIES OF THE STATE SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND PARTICULAR ATTENTION SH OULD BE PAID TO THE
TERMINOLOGY USED.

REPORT ON THE FIFTH SESSION OF THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE ON THE UNCSTD (UNITED
NATIONS CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT) DRAFT PROGRAMME
OF ACTION AND ESPECIALLY ITS DECISIONS REGARDING INFORMATION SERVICES. THERE
WAS EVIDENCE, PARTICULARLY AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, OF A GREAT NEED FOR
INFORMATION TO HELP IN THE ASSESSMENT AND APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE WAS CLEARLY A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EXISTING
INFORMATION FACILITIES. RECOMMENDATIONS CALLED ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO MAKE
THEIR INFORMATION RESOURCES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND CALLED
FOR AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE NETWORK. THE NETWORK WOULD MAKE FULL
USE OF EXISTING SPECIALISED INFORMATION NETWORKS AND CONSIST OF A SERIES OF
SUBNETWORKS IN EACH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

EDITED TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF THE PRESENTATION. BUILDS THE TERM
'INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS', STARTING WITH 'SYSTEMS' AND

LEARNED JOURNAL: THE VIEWS OF THE MAJOR SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS.
INFORMATION THEORY AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION.

INFORMAL AND FORMAL COMMUNICATION PROCESSES ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE PRIMARY
JOURNAL LITERATURE. BOTH PROCESSES IMPOSE STRUCTURES ON THE AUTHORS WHO
PUBLISH THEIR RESEARCH, AND THE FORMAL PROCESS IMPOSES A STRUCTURE ON THE
JOURNALS WHICH PUBLISH SCIENTIFIC PAPERS. IT IS SHOWN THAT INFORMATION THEORY
CAN BE APPLIED TO THESE STRUCTURES TO EVALUATE AUTHOR AND JOURNAL
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNICATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS IDENTIFY THE MOST COMMUNICATIVE AUTHORS AND JOURNALS IN AN AREA OF
ACTIVE RESEARCH.
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF SELECTIVITY.

A MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES IS ADAPTED TO

TOOL FOR CHANGE, CONTROL AND DEVELOPMENT OF HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

THIS SYSTEMS ANALYSIS PROJECT DESCRIBES AN IMPORTANT STUDY PROJECT BASIC TO
THE HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS HOSPITAL. THE
INTENT OF THE PROJECT WAS TO MAKE EXPLICIT THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL EXCHANGES
OF DATA THAT OCCUR FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TRANSMITTAL OF INFORMATION.
AN ADDITIONAL INTENT WAS TO IDENTIFY SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INFORMATION USERS
AS WELL AS THOSE INVOLVED IN EACH TRANSACTION WHICH CREATED INFORMATION.
INFORMATION? WE CAN HELP YOU.

DESCRIBES THE INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE WELDING INSTITUTE, ABINGDON, (UK)
WHICH DEALS WITH OVER 10,000 ENQUIRIES A YEAR FROM ITS MEMBERS. MEMBERS SHOULD
ASK THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY NEED INFORMATION; WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW, WHEN AND
HOW. THE INFORMATION SERVICE INCLUDES LOANS AND REFERENCE SERVICE, BOOKS AND
JOURNALS, PATENTS, MATERIALS SPECIFICATIONS, AND WELDASEARCH-A COMPUTER DATA
BASE, AVAILABLE VIA LOCKHEED DIALOG. A TECHNICAL ENQUIRY SERVICE IS AVAILABLE
TO RESEARCH MEMBER COMPANIES, THOUGH NOT TO PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS INDIVIDUALLY.
FEASIBILITY STUDY OF AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT INFORMATION DISSEMINATION
SYSTEM.

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT IS AN APPROACH TO PEST CONTROL WHICH MAXIMISES THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF NATURAL CONTROLS OF PEST POPULATION AND REDUCES THE NEED FOR
APPLICATION OF CHEMICAL PESTICIDES. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE
REQUIREMENTS FOR, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF, AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR IPM
INFORMATION DISSEMINATION.
PESTICIDE LABEL FILE UPDATE.

THE FEDERAL INSECTICIDE, FUNGICIDE, AND RODENTICIDE ACT REQUIRES THAT THE
LABELS OF ALL REGISTERED PESTICIDES CONTAIN CERTAIN SPECIFIC TYPES OF
INFORMATION. INCLUDED IN THE INFORMATION OF THE LABELS ARE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS
AND PERCENTAGES OF SAME; COMMON NAME, IF ANY, OF ACTIVE CHEMICAL; SITES AND
PESTS FOR USAGE, AS WELL AS DOSAGE; SAFETY INFORMATION, AND THE PRODUCT NAME
AND MANUFACTURER FOR THAT SPECIFIC PRODUCT.
TECHNOLOGICAL LIBRARIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES. TASKS AND METHODS IN
THE ORGANISATION OF INFORMATION TRANSFER.

THE RAPID CHANGES IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT DEMAND QUICK AND EFFECTIVE
DECISION-MAKING. THE LIBRARY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS. DISCUSSES
PROBLEMS WITH INFORMATION SOURCES, INFORMATION CHANNELS, PROCESSING AND TIMING
OF DISTRIBUTION. PROPOSES A SYSTEM IN WHICH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION IS
CONTROLLED BY 3 PROCESSES. MANAGEMENT SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AN INFORMATION
SERVICE BY PROVIDING FEEDBACK.
ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF MANAGERS OF A RESEARCH INSTITUTE.

A QUESTIONNAIRE BASED METHOD WAS DESIGNED AND USED TO ANALYSE THE INFORMATION
REQUIREMENTS OF MANAGERS OF RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN DEPARTMENTS OF AN
INSTRUMENTATION RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT REPORTING TO THE MINISTRY OF
INSTRUMENTATION. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED. THE
METHOD IS EQUALLY SUITABLE FOR ANALYSES OF THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGERS OF COMPANIES WITH DIFFERENT SUBJECT PROFILES OR MANAGERS
OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS.
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENT SECRETS.

US GOVERNMENT LIBRARIANS USE A VARIETY OF SOURCES BEYOND THE USUAL WHO'S WHOS
TO LOCATE BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON US AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, INTERNATIONAL
FIGURES, AND US GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THESE SOURCES INCLUDE ON-LINE SERVICES,
BOOKS AND BACK FILES, THE CARD CATALOGUE, STATE DEPARTMENT AND CIA
PUBLICATIONS, OTHER GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND TRADE PUBLICATIONS. IN ADDITION,
TELEPHONE CONTACTS ARE OFTEN USEFUL. LISTS OF CIA BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORIES AND
US GOVERNMENT AGENCY PRESS OFFICES ARE APPENDED.
THE FOUNDATIONS OF UNITED STATES INFORMATION POLICY. A UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT SUBMISSION TO THE HIGH-LEVEL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION, COMPUTER,
AND COMMUNICATIONS POLICY, ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND
DEVELOPMENT, PARIS, FRANCE, OCTOBER 6-8, 1980.

US INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION POLICIES, AS AN EXTENSION OF DOMESTIC POLICIES,
MUST BE EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF THEIR CONTINUING VALIDITY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO
CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS. WITH THE INCREASED PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT,
THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE FOCUS OF THESE DELIBERATIONS IN THE US. SOME
FUNDAMENTAL POLICY ASSUMPTIONS EMERGE AS THE FOUNDATION OF US POLICIES; THESE
ASSUMPTIONS AND THE TRADEOFFS THEY IMPLY ARE DISCUSSED.
PERSONALLY SPEAKING-INFORMATION SERVICES IN AFRICA: A LUXURY OR A NECESSITY?.

DISCUSSES INFORMATION NEEDS IN AFRICA, AND PARTICULARLY IN MALAWI, AND
RECOMMENDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, BASED ON EXISTING
AFRICAN LIBRARIES, ARCHIVES AND MUSEUMS. THE RESOURCES EXIST-WHAT REMAINS TO
BE DONE IS PLANNING. AN INFORMATION NETWORK IS NEEDED WHICH NOT ONLY INCREASES
THE ABILITY TO SHARE RESOURCES WITHIN THE COUNTRY, BUT ALSO THE CAPABILITY TO
INTERFACE WITH INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS AND DATA BASES.
A MALAYSIAN NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (MANIS).

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE THIRD CONFERENCE OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN LIBRARIANS,
JAKARTA, DEC 75. EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITIES OF CREATING AN INTEGRATED
MALAYSIAN NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (MANIS) IN THE LIGHT OF THE 12
OBJECTIVES DETAILED IN THE FINAL REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE ON
THE PLANNING OF NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION, LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES INFRASTRUCTURES
(PARIS, 1975-COM/MD/30).
APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO RURAL AREAS THROUGH INFORMATION TRANSFER.

EXPLAINS THE CONCEPT OF APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF RURAL
DEVELOPMENT, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO INDIA. INDICATES THE PROBLEMS IN ITS
IMPLEMENTATION AND SUGGESTS A COORDINATING MEDIUM TO OVERCOME SUCH PROBLEMS.
CONSIDERING THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A FOCAL POINT OF COMMUNICATION,
HIGHLIGHTS VARIOUS CHANNELS OF INFORMATION PROCESS AND DISSEMINATION,
STRESSING THE DOMINANT ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES IN BRINGING
SUCCESS TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
BASIC COSTS OF INFORMATION WORK.

INVESTIGATES THE ECONOMIC CHARACTER OF BASIC COSTS (I.E. OF COSTS CONNECTED
WITH THE USAGE OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION PLUS THE USE OF MANPOWER) ACCORDING
TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CATEGORIES. ANALYSES THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THEM AND
SHOWS HOW TO ASSESS BASIC COSTS OF RUNNING AN INFORMATION CENTRE BY MEANS OF A
MODEL.
A WORLDWIDE NETWORK FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION: RECOMMENDATIONS OF A UN
STUDY.

DISCUSSES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN OF A WORLDWIDE NETWORK FOR
TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION, A PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY THE AUTHOR IN SPRING 79
UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. ITS
PURPOSE WOULD BE 'TO PLACE INFORMATION SERVICES...AT THE DISPOSAL OF
PROBLEM-SOLVERS AND DECISION-MAKERS IN THE REALM OF NATIONAL SOCIOECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT'. ITS PRINCIPAL FUNCTION WOULD BE TO FORWARD AND STORE MESSAGES
BETWEEN SERVICES AND CLIENTELE, MAINLY BY COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SWITCHING. A
NETWORK STRUCTURE COMPRISING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY NODES IS SUGGESTED. A
3-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PHASE FOLLOWED BY A 4TH YEAR OF PILOT OPERATION AND
EVALUATION IS RECOMMENDED.
DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF AUTOMATED DATA BANKS.

DISCUSSES THE SOFTWARE, DATA ORGANISATION, AND LANGUAGE OF THE COMPUTERISED
DATA BANKS PEGAS, AIDOS, BASTAI, SIOD-2, BANK, AND NABOB. COMPARES THEIR DATA
BASE CAPACITY, RETRIEVAL TIME FOR AN INDEX, AND CONFIGURATION OF COMPUTER
EQUIPMENT FOR EACH.
COLLECTING SENSITIVE DATA ANONYMOUSLY: FURTHER FINDINGS ON THE CDRGP TECHNIQUE.

DESCRIBES A CONFIDENTIALITY-PRESERVING DATA COLLECTION METHOD CALLED THE
CONTEXT-DETERMINED, RULE-GENERATED, PSEUDONYM (CDRGP) TECHNIQUE, A
SPECIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED SET OF QUESTIONS BASED UPON PERSONAL INFORMATION
KNOWN TO THE RESPONDENT (BUT TO FEW OTHERS) WHICH EACH RESPONDENT ANSWERS
WHENEVER DATA ARE GATHERED: THE RESPONDENT'S ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS GENERATE
A PROBABILISTICALLY UNIQUE STRING OF LETTERS, OR CODE IDENTIFIER, THAT ALLOWS
THE DATA BEING COLLECTED TO BE TIED TO PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED DATA. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL, LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.

THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISED IDENTIFICATION HAS ALARMED MANY PEOPLE IN
DENMARK AS ELSEWHERE. UNDER AN 1978 ACT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE HAS
ALREADY ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS ON CATALOGUING AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES. THE MAIN
QUESTION CONCERNS THE LINKING OF BORROWER TO BOOK, THOUGH THIS WAS EQUALLY
POSSIBLE WITH OLDER ISSUE SYSTEMS. IN 2 RECENT CASES INVOLVING TERRORISM AND
MURDER, LIBRARIES HAVE RELUCTANTLY SUPPLIED POLICE WITH INFORMATION GENERALLY
REGARDED AS CONFIDENTIAL. THE LIBRARY OFFICE PROPOSES AN EXPLICIT STATEMENT OF
LIBRARIANS' DUTY TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, ABD STRICTER CONTROL OF
OUT-OF-DATE PHOTOGRAPHIC ISSUE RECORDS. WHEN COMPUTER ISSUE SYSTEMS BECOME
COMMON, SUCH INFORMATION WILL BE MORE EASILY OBTAINED, AND THE DANISH LIBRARY
COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE A BORROWER
ONCE HIS BOOK IS RETURNED. WHILE THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE 1978 ACT, ANY
FUTURE REVISION OF THE LIBRARY ACT SHOULD  STATE THE POSITION IN UNAMBIGUOUS
TERMS.
SO YOU THINK YOUR DATA IS SAFE.

INFORMED SOURCES SUGGEST THAT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INFORMATION
IS BEING STOLEN OR ERASED FROM COMPUTER MEMORIES IN THE USA ANNUALLY AND THAT
THIS NEW TYPE OF THEFT IS NOW EVIDENT IN THE UK AS WELL. INDICATES, WITH TRUE
EXAMPLES, HOW VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIMINAL CAN 'BEAT THE SYSTEM'; OUTLINES HOW
DATA CAN BE SOLD AND MISUSED IN THE UK; AND EXPLAINS THE NEED FOR UK DATA
PROTECTION LEGISLATION, WITHOUT WHICH IT COULD BECOME THE LEPER COLONY OF
UNSAFE INFORMATION WITH COMPANIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES REFUSING TO TRANSMIT
VALUABLE DATA INTO THE UK.
NEDS NATIONAL EMISSIONS DATA SYSTEM INFORMATION.

THE NATIONAL EMISSIONS DATA SYSTEM (NEDS) IS AN AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING
SYSTEM USED BY THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY FOR STORAGE OF DATA ON
SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION. NEDS IS A PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE AEROMETRIC AND
EMISSIONS REPORTING SYSTEM (AEROS).
INFOTERRA: AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK.

INFOTERRA (INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL SYSTEM FOR SOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL
INFORMATION) WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME AS
PART OF EARTHWATCH, ITS PROGRAMME FOR THE CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GLOBAL
ENVIRONMENT. IN OPERATION SINCE JAN 77, IT HAS A DECENTRALISED STRUCTURE AND
ITS NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND SECTORIAL FOCAL POINTS AND THE INFOTERRA PROGRAMME
ACTIVITY CENTRE ACT AS SWITCHBOARDS, CONNECTING USERS WITH APPROPRIATE
INFORMATION SOURCES OR (IF THEIR RESOURCES ALLOW) SOMETIMES PROVIDING
INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE USER. INFOTERRA IS NOT A SUBSTANTIVE INFORMATION
SYSTEM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE DOCUMENTS. AFTER INITIAL HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE
SYSTEM, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE NOW MAJOR PARTICIPANTS AND INFOTERRA IS
ENCOURAGING AND HELPING THEM TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
SHARING DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION.

DURING THE PAST 2 YEARS, THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS UNIT OF THE UNITED NATIONS
DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS HAS BEEN RUNNING A
PILOT PROJECT TO ESTABLISH AN AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEM, DEVELOPMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM, AND TO PROVIDE INTRADEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION OF
INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACTIVITIES. THE SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL WITH A
SAMPLE DATA BASE OF ALMOST 2,000 RECORDS. TO AVOID UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION,
FULL USE WAS MADE OF THE DEVSIS (DEVELOPMENT SCIENCES INFORMATION SYSTEM)
PRELIMINARY DESIGNS AND THE MACROTHESAURUS. THE MINISIS MINICOMPUTER SYSTEM,
DEVELOPED BY THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CENTRE, IS BEING TESTED
FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS. THE SYSTEM IS COMPATIBLE WITH SEVERAL OTHER UNITED
NATIONS SYSTEMS.
INVESTIGATION INTO USERS' REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
TO THE DESIGN OF AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

INTENDED FOR DESIGNERS OF COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICES DEALING WITH
INTERDISCIPLINARY SUBJECTS. THE 1ST PART DISCUSSES BASIC METHODOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS IN GENERAL AND SHOWS HOW A SET OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CAN HELP WITH
THE PROCEDURE. IT SHOWS FURTHER HOW THIS METHOD WAS APPLIED TO THE DESIGN OF
THE CZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION, AND
LOOKS INTO THE CATEGORIES OF USERS THIS SYSTEM IS TO SERVE.
REGISTER OF RESEARCH PROJECTS-AN UNKNOWN FORM OF INFORMATION SERVICE.

IN THE USA THERE ARE SEVERAL REGISTERS FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS AVAILABLE. THE
LARGEST OF THESE IS SMITHSONIAN SCIENCE INFORMATION EXCHANGE (SSIE). IT WAS
ESTABLISHED IN 1949 TO FURTHER MEDICAL RESEARCH. SINCE 1960 RESEARCH FROM
OTHER FIELDS HAS BEEN REGISTERED. THE DATA BASE HAS INFORMATION ON ABOUT
200,000 PROJECTS AT PRESENT. ANNUAL ENTRIES ARE OVER 125,000. AN ENTRY
INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDING BODY AND THE RESEARCHERS, AND A SUMMARY
OF THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL. A THESAURUS IS USED FOR SEARCHING THE DATA BASE.
LOCKHEED DIALOG OR SDC CAN BE USED ON-LINE. IN ADDITION SSIE PUBLISHES SSIE
SCIENCE NEWSLETTER. FINNISH PROJECTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DATA BASE.
STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT ON STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY METHODS DEVELOPMENT.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE THE AGENCY WITH THE
TECHNICAL BASIS FOR ESTIMATING THE TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOUR OF
ORGANIC CHEMICALS FROM MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. THE PROJECT IS DIRECTED TOWARD THE
EVALUATION OF QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS (QSAR) FOR USE BY
EPA PROGRAM OFFICES AND TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DATA AND QSAR METHODS TO
EXTEND THE TECHNIQUE TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE
STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP METHODS TO PREDICT THE TOXICITY,
PERSISTENCE, AND TREATABILITY OF LARGE NUMBERS OF UNTESTED CHEMICALS USING
QSAR BASED ON STRUCTURAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF
REPRESENTATIVE REFERENCE DATA BASES.
COMPUTER SIMULATION OF PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC MOLECULES. 1.
MOLECULAR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION.

A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH GENERATES MOLECULAR GEOMETRIES AND PERFORMS MOLECULAR
CALCULATIONS FOR ORGANIC MOLECULES IS PRESENTED. A LINEAR CODING METHODOLOGY
USED FOR INPUTTING THE MOLECULES IS ALSO DESCRIBED. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF
A PROGRAM AIMED AT THE SIMULATION OF THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF
ORGANIC MOLECULES.
COMPUTER PERCEPTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SYMMETRY VIA CANONICAL NUMBERING OF ATOMS.

AN ALGORITHM FOR PERCEPTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SYMMETRY HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED FOR
COMPUTER USE. THE ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE SMALLEST BINARY
CODE FOR A GRAPH AND REQUIRES GENERATION OF ALL NUMBERINGS FOR A STRUCTURE
WHICH WILL PRODUCE THE CANONICAL FORM FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX. THE UNIQUE
ADJACENCY MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE (BINARY) NUMBER
REPRESENTING THE STRUCTURE WHEN ITS ROWS ARE READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND FROM
LEFT TO RIGHT. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM IS ILLUSTRATED WITH A SELECTION OF
POLYCYCLIC STRUCTURES.
REGISTRATION-IDENTIFICATION OF CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS BASED ON LATTICE AND
EMPIRICAL FORMULA.

DATA FILES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON SOLID-STATE MATERIALS ARE EXPANDING
RAPIDLY. EACH YEAR SEVERAL THOUSAND NEW MATERIALS ARE CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY
DIFFRACTION TECHNIQUES. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPUTER PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
TO REGISTER MATERIALS ENTERING LARGE DATA FILES. REGISTRATION BASED ON LATTICE
PARAMETERS AND EMPIRICAL FORMULA IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE. THE LATTICE IS
UNIQUELY REPRESENTED BY THE REDUCED CELL AND THE ELEMENTS IN THE FORMULA ARE
UNIQUELY SPECIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR SEVERAL
YEARS TO REGISTER NEW MATERIALS FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA FILE
WHICH CONTAINS DATA ON MORE THAN 25,000 COMPOUNDS CONTAINING ORGANIC CARBON.
THE METHOD IS NOW BEING ADAPTED TO REGISTER MATERIALS FOR THE NBS CRYSTAL DATA
FILE.
NATIONAL HEALTH PLANNING INFORMATION CENTER, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE FINAL
REPORT, OCTOBER 27, 1977-MARCH 31, 1980.

THE PURPOSE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH PLANNING INFORMATION CENTER (NHPIC) IS TO
PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF HEALTH
PLANNING AND TO DEVELOP A READILY RETRIEVABLE COMPUTERISED FILE OF THAT
INFORMATION. NHPIC INCLUDES HEALTH PLANNING AND NURSING INFORMATION COMPONENTS
AND, EARLY IN THE PROJECT PERIOD, INCLUDED A LONG-TERM CARE COMPONENT.

THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM IS A GENERAL PURPOSE,
DIGITAL DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR FIELD USE IN THE DOE'S STRATEGIC
PETROLEUM RESERVE TESTING AND MONITORING PROGRAMME.
TOWARD LIBRARY LITERACY.

DEFINES WHAT IS MEANT BY 'LIBRARY LITERACY' AND SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIANS
SHOULD AIM TO EDUCATE USERS, AND IN PARTICULAR STUDENT USERS, MORE BROADLY IN
THE SKILLS NEEDED TO MAKE FULL USE OF A LIBRARY, WHICH CAN THEN BE APPLIED IN
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS, RATHER THAN TRAIN THEM IN DEPTH IN THE USE OF SPECIFIC
WORKS WITHIN THEIR OWN LIBRARY.
PUTTING THE LIBRARY ON THE BOX: THE COOLOCK EXPERIMENT.

DESCRIBES THE MAKING OF A VIDEO FILM ON LIBRARY USE BY THE STAFF OF THE
COOLOCK PUBLIC LIBRARY IN DUBLIN CITY FOR USER EDUCATION. DISCUSSES A NUMBER
OF DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF THE FILM, AND NOTES SOME OF THE
LESSONS LEARNT BY STAFF DURING ITS PRODUCTION. INDICATES SOME IMPROVEMENTS
WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FILM IF IT HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY PROFESSIONAL
FILM MAKERS AND ON MORE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT. NEVERTHELESS, STRESSES THE
NEED FOR LIBRARIANS TO BECOME INVOLVED IN FILM PRODUCTION IN ORDER TO BECOME
AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH PROJECTS.

UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

USER TRAINING IN THE MEDIA CENTRE, DUISBURG UNIVERSITY, WEST GERMANY, IS PART
OF THE TRAINING GIVEN TO STUDENTS, LECTURERS AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IN THE
USE OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. MEDIA CENTRE STOCKS COMPRISE 30,000
UNITS. INSTRUCTION IS GIVEN THROUGH LEAFLETS, LECTURES, DEMONSTRATION MEDIA
SEARCHES, LISTS OF NEW ACQUISITIONS AND ALSO THROUGH SLIDE SETS WITH
COMMENTARIES, PROJECTED ON EQUIPMENT SUITABLE FOR USE BY SMALL GROUPS OR BY
INDIVIDUALS WITH HEADPHONES. THE SLIDE PROGRAMMES, LASTING ABOUT 12 MINUTES,
CONSIST OF 75 SLIDES; THEY COVER STOCKS, EQUIPMENT, CATALOGUES AND OTHER
QUESTIONS SUCH AS INTER-LIBRARY LOAN. THE SLIDE PROGRAMME METHOD, WIDELY USED
IN MUSEUMS, HAS PROVED HELPFUL TO USERS HERE AND AROUSED PUBLIC INTEREST.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION.

AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DEFINE THE SUBJECT OF AN AUXILIARY SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE
DEVOTED TO THE THEORY AND METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION. THE 3 MAIN
FUNCTIONS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION ARE DISCUSSED: (1) INFORMATION FUNCTION
(INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A CERTAIN DOCUMENT); (2) IDENTIFICATION
FUNCTION (A DOCUMENT CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION); AND (3)
RETRIEVAL FUNCTION (BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION HERE IS A MEANS FOR RETRIEVAL OF
A DOCUMENT FROM AN INFORMATION SYSTEM).
CATALOGUE ENTRIES FOR ITEMS IN COLLECTIONS PUBLISHED IN MICROFORM.

THE PROBLEM OF MAKING KNOWN TO LIBRARY USERS THE CONTENTS OF COLLECTIONS OF
MATERIALS PUBLISHED IN MICROFORM ARE DISCUSSED. WAYS OF OVERCOMING THE PROBLEM
ARE OUTLINED, SUCH AS THE USE OF PUBLISHED GUIDES TO MICROFORM COLLECTIONS,
ADDED ENTRIES TO CARD CATALOGUES, AND ANALYTICAL CATALOGUE ENTRIES FOR
COLLECTIONS. THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EACH METHOD ARE GIVEN. THE
VARIOUS ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE UK TO OVERCOME
THE PROBLEM ARE OUTLINED. A SIGNIFICANT MOVE TOWARDS UNIVERSALLY USEFUL
ENTRIES IS THE ADOPTION OF AACR2 FOR VARIOUS NATIONAL AUTOMATED DATA BASES.
IDEALLY, THERE SHOULD NOW BE COOPERATION WITH PUBLISHERS FOR
CATALOGUING-IN-SOURCE FOR MICROFORM PUBLICATIONS.
DEVSIS: A PHILOSOPHY OF DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION.

IN THE ABSENCE OF THE INTERESTS WHICH LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEMS SUCH
AS MEDLARS OR INIS, IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO COORDINATE THEIR
DOCUMENTARY RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR LEAST FAVOURED PEOPLE.
AFRICAN DEVSIS WILL FORM PART OF INTERNATIONAL DEVIS. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT THE
COORDINATING CENTRE WILL HAVE A SMALL, HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF AND EMPHASIS
WILL BE PLACED ON PROMOTING NATIONAL CENTRES. THE PAPER IS FOLLOWED BY A
DISCUSSION BY JOHN WOOLSTON OUTLINING THE GENESIS OF DEVSIS AND VARIOUS
EXPERIMENTS AND GRASS-ROOTS INITIATIVES WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE ALONG DEVSIS
LINES. THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UN HAS YET TO DISCUSS GENERAL ADOPTION OF
THE PROGRAMME.
THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS).

SUGGESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS) HAS BEEN SO
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS DECIDED UPON IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN
HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME; THE ADVANTAGES OF ITS DECENTRALISED INPUT HAVE
BEEN MAXIMISED THROUGH DETAILED GUIDELINES, TRAINING, AND GOOD COMMUNICATIONS;
THERE IS A STRONG CENTRAL MANAGEMENT WHICH, THROUGH NATIONAL LIAISON OFFICERS,
IS VERY RESPONSIVE TO MEMBER STATES; AND THERE IS A STRONG SPIRIT OF GOODWILL
AND COOPERATION, GENERATING MUCH OF THE MOTIVATION.
AGRIS-INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES AND
TECHNOLOGY.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE NEED FOR AGRIS, ITS DEVELOPMENT, PROJECTS BEING CARRIED OUT
BY AGRIS MEMBER COUNTRIES, AGRIS INFORMATION SERVICES, CARIS (CURRENT

DESCRIBES INDEX ISLAMICUS, A CATALOGUE OF ARTICLES ON ISLAMIC SUBJECTS IN
PERIODICAL LITERATURE, COMPILED IN 1958 BY J.D. PEARSON AND JULIA F. ASHTON,
AND REPRINTED IN 1961 WITH MINOR CORRECTIONS AND AN EXTENDED ABBREVIATIONS
LIST. IT INCLUDES AN AUTHOR INDEX AND SOURCE LIST, AND 3 SUPPLEMENTS, COVERING
1956-60, 1961-65 AND 1966-70.
A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SUBJECT APPROACHES IN C.I.J.E. AND EDUCATION INDEX WITH
REFERENCE TO THREE AREAS IN EDUCATION.

EXAMINES THE DIFFERENCES IN SUBJECT APPROACHES FOUND BETWEEN 2 SECONDARY
SERVICES IN EDUCATION: EDUCATION INDEX AND ERIC'S CURRENT INDEX TO JOURNALS IN
EDUCATION (CIJE). A SAMPLE OF 30 JOURNAL ARTICLES WAS TAKEN FROM EACH TOOL IN
THE AREAS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION, AND SPECIAL
EDUCATION; AFTER AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISPLAYS OF
THESAURAL DESCRIPTORS IN CIJE AND THE SUBJECT HEADINGS IN EDUCATION INDEX, AN
ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THE TOPICS UNDER WHICH EACH ARTICLE WAS INDEXED IN BOTH
TOOLS. THE DATA ANALYSIS INCLUDES A QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE,
THE STRUCTURE OF THE 3 AREAS IN EDUCATION AS FOUND IN BOTH THE THESAURUS AND
SUBJECT HEADING LIST, TERMINOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND A GENERAL SUMMATION
OF FINDINGS. THE THESAURUS AND ITS ROLE IN THE RETRIEVAL OF MATERIALS
UTILIZING EDUCATIONAL TERMINOLOGY IS DISCUSSED  ALONG WITH PROBLEMS
ENCOUNTERED IN TRYING TO INDEX EDUCATIONAL TERMS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
ON WHAT BASIS HAVE YOU ORGANISED THIS LIBRARY SINCE ONE CANNOT FIND ANYTHING
IN HERE? (A SURVEY OF USERS: INFORMATION NEEDS).

ASU-RYHMA, A PILOT WORKING GROUP ON A FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST CARRIED OUT
A SURVEY IN OVER 30 PUBLIC LIBRARIES ABOUT THE NATURE OF ENQUIRIES IN 1 MONTH.
4,600 ENQUIRIES WERE LISTED. THIS FIGURE INCLUDES ENQUIRIES OVER A LONGER
PERIOD IN SOME OF THE LIBRARIES. A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE ENQUIRIES CONCERNED
NON-FICTION. THE MOST POPULAR SUBJECT AREAS WERE LITERATURE, LAW, MUSIC AND
HANDICRAFTS. ON PAGES 114 AND 115 THE TYPES OF ENQUIRIES ARE LISTED BY BROAD
CLASSIFICATION. A FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST IS NEEDED URGENTLY BECAUSE OF
THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF MANY OF THE ENQUIRIES FOR WHICH THE CLASSIFICATION
SCHEME USED IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CANNOT CATER.
STATISTICAL SAMPLING OF REFERENCE DESK INQUIRIES.

DISCUSSES THE APPLICATION OF STATISTICAL SAMPLING TO THE COMPILING OF
REFERENCE DESK STATISTICS. DESCRIBES A TECHNIQUE THAT USES THE PEARSON
CORRELATION PROCEDURE OF SPSS (STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES) TO
DETERMINE APPROPRIATE SAMPLING PERIODS FOR KEEPING REFERENCE DESK STATISTICS
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT ST. LOUIS. COVERS RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS OF
THE FINDINGS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF THE PROCEDURE TO OTHER
LIBRARY SITUATIONS.
DESIGNING OPTICAL MARK FORMS FOR REFERENCE STATISTICS.

DATA ARE RECORDED ON OPTICAL MARK FORMS USING A SOFT PENCIL TO PLACE A SERIES
OF MARKS IN SPECIFIED AREAS, A TECHNIQUE THAT IS COMMONLY USED ON EXAMINATION
ANSWER SHEETS. THE DATA ARE THEN AVAILABLE FOR COMPUTER TABULATION AND
ANALYSIS. REFERENCE-DESK STATISTICS CAN EFFICIENTLY BE COLLECTED IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM BY USING SUCH A TECHNIQUE. INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE
DESIGN OF AN OPTICAL MARK FORM IS PRESENTED ALONG WITH IMPORTANT SOFTWARE
CONSIDERATIONS. THE OVERRIDING CONCERN WHEN DESIGNING AN OPTICAL MARK FORM TO
BE USED AT THE REFERENCE DESK IS TO PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO RECORD ALL
NECESSARY INFORMATION WHILE REQUIRING AS FEW MARKS AS POSSIBLE. USEFUL DATA
CATEGORIES ARE IDENTIFIED, AND FIGURES ILLUSTRATE HOW DATA CAN BE RECORDED FOR
EACH CATEGORY. PRESENTS INFORMATION RESULTING FROM THE DESIGN AND USE OF SUCH
A PROGRAMME AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA.
THE FEASIBILITY OF AN INTERNATIONAL MULTILATERAL UNESCO CONVENTION ON THE
UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS.

THE ADOPTION OF A MULTILATERAL INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE UNIVERSAL
AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP) IS THE BEST POSSIBLE GUARANTEE FOR THE
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE UNESCO
UAP CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN 1981-82. THIS CONVENTION SHOULD DECLARE THE
PRINCIPLE OF UAP AND SHOULD DETERMINE THE BASIC OBLIGATIONS OF NATIONAL
GOVERNMENTS IN THE CREATION OF THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF A UAP SYSTEM.
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED ARE THE ROLES OF UNESCO AND IFLA,
FORMATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL COLLECTION OF PUBLICATIONS, ADJUSTMENTS OF
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS TO THE PRINCIPLES OF UAP, AND PROVISION FOR
A SPECIAL UNESCO FUND FOR UAP. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
AUTOMATED TEXT PROCESSING AS AN AID TO RATIONALISING PURCHASING AND STOCK
ADMINISTRATION IN DOCUMENTATION.

FORMERLY MOST INFORMATION HAD TO BE OBTAINED FROM ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS,
RESULTING IN THE RECOVERY OF ONLY A FEW COINCIDENTAL REFERENCES. THE USE OF
ON-LINE TECHNIQUES FACILITATES THE MAKING OF GLOBAL INFORMATION SURVEYS
INDEPENDENT OF SOURCES AT HAND. AUTOMATED TEXT PROCESSING REDUCES THE NEED FOR
DIRECT CONTACT WITH PUBLISHED MATERIAL AND MAINTENANCE OF ORIGINAL STOCKS. THE
SULZER COMPANY USES AUTOMATED TEXT PROCESSING IN ORDERING AND SUPPLY OF
INFORMATION, FOR THE CATALOGUE, ACCESSIONS INDEX, PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION
CONTROL AND PRINTING THE PERIODICAL INDEX; THE COMPUTER SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL. CONTROL OF PERIODICAL CIRCULATION IS ALSO BEING INCORPORATED INTO THE
SYSTEM. THUS WORK PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN REDUCED, LEAVING STAFF FREE FOR MORE
DEMANDING TASKS.
NETWORKS AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES IN ONTARIO.

REPORT OF A VISIT TO ONTARIO TO OBSERVE AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN A VARIETY
OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE OPERATION OF UTLAS AND ITS
ON-LINE CATALOGUE SUPPORT SYSTEM (CATSS) PROVIDING ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL
SOURCES OF CATALOGUING DATA. DOBIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED FOR USE BY THE CANADIAN
INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION, AND CNA-DOBIS IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN OTHER INSTITUTIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF THE QUALITY AND EXTENT OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN CANADA IS GIVEN.
STUDY OF COOPERATION IN THE PROCESSING OF THE TECHNICAL REPORT LITERATURE.

THE PROJECT WORK CONSISTED OF THE COLLECTION AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF LISTS OF
DATA ELEMENTS CURRENTLY USED BY THE MAJOR REPORTS-PROCESSING AGENCIES OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: DTIC, DOE, NASA AND NTIS. THE DATA ELEMENTS AND THEIR TAGS
OR CONTENT INDICATORS WERE COMPARED, EQUATED OR DISTINGUISHED, AND LISTED IN A
MATRIX FORMAT FOR EASE OF REVIEW.

DESCRIBES THE COMPOSITION AND OPERATION OF THE LIBRARY OF THE GRAY FRESHWATER
BIOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, A NON-TRADITIONAL
INFORMATION SERVICE WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION TO THE INSTITUTE BY COMBINING
THE USE OF 3 BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES WITH CURRENT AWARENESS SERVICES, OCLC,
MINITEX, AND AUTHOR REPRINT REQUEST CARDS. THE RELATIONSHIP OF EACH OF THESE
SOURCES TO THE LIBRARY IS DISCUSSED SEPARATELY. FIGURES ILLUSTRATE LIBRARY
RETRIEVAL PROCEDURES, AND TABLES PROVIDE DATA ON EXPENDITURES, REQUEST
PUBLICATION DATES, NUMBER OF REQUESTS, LENDING LIBRARIES, NUMBER OF JOURNALS
BY LENDER, NUMBER OF REQUESTS BY LENDER, DATA BASE COSTS, ON-LINE VERSUS
PRINTED INDEX COSTS, REQUEST SOURCES, OCLC COSTS, AND THE REQUEST FILL RATE.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE TOTAL LIBRARY SYSTEM.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOTAL LIBRARY SYSTEM BY PATRICK BARKEY AT THE
HUNNOLD LIBRARY, CLAREMONT COLLEGE, CALIFORNIA. THE EXTENSIVE ON-LINE SYSTEM
ENABLES INFORMATION TO BE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM THE OHIO COLLEGE LIBRARY
CENTER (OCLC) TERMINAL TO THE COMPUTER FOR ACQUISITIONS, BOOKKEEPING,
CIRCULATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHES, WITH VERY LITTLE MANUAL INTERVENTION,
THUS CUTTING DOWN ON STAFF NUMBERS. 4 LOCAL CHARACTER CODES ARE ADDED TO OCLC
RECORDS, IDENTIFYING THE VENDOR, REQUESTOR, THE FUND AGAINST WHICH THE
PURCHASE IS TO BE CHARGED, AND ANY SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS. DESCRIBES THE USE OF
BAR CODES IN THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM, UPDATING THE CATALOGUE AND ACQUISITIONS
PROCEDURE FOR BOOKS. SAVINGS ARE NOW BEING SPENT ON NEW BOOKS.

SUMMARY, BY MARGARET LANDESMAN, IS A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE PRECONFERENCE,
REFLECTING THE GENERAL MOOD AND BRIEFLY SUMMARISING THE COMMENTS OF
PARTICIPANTS.
ACQUISITIONS OF LIBRARY MATERIALS DISCUSSION GROUP, MIDWINTER 1980: THE REPORT.

(REPORT OF THE DISCUSSION GROUP AT THE ALA MIDWINTER MEETING, 1980.) THE 1ST
PART OF THE PROGRAMME WAS A PAPER BY MARJORIE HASSEN ON PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN
MUSIC ACQUISITIONS. THE 2ND PAPER, BY CHARLES WILLETT, DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF
THE ACQUISITIONS DEPARTMENT IN RELATION TO BRANCH LIBRARIES. PAPERS ARE
SUMMARISED.
EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF ACQUISITION OF DOMESTIC LITERATURE.

A METHOD IS PRESENTED WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF
ACQUISITION OF DOMESTIC (USSR) LITERATURE. THE METHOD, DEVELOPED BY THE STATE
PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY, IS BASED ON USING EVALUATION INDICES
EXPRESSING THE COMPLETENESS OF STOCK AND 'THE MEAN WAITING PERIOD OF LOAN
REQUESTS'.
ARCHIVAL RESOURCES AT THE MELVILLE J. HERSKOVITS LIBRARY OF AFRICAN STUDIES.

DESCRIBES EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE ARCHIVAL HOLDING OF THE HERSKOVITS LIBRARY OF
AFRICAN STUDIES AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, ILLINOIS. THE LIBRARY HAS WRITTEN
TO 400 SCHOLARS DESCRIBED IN ACADEMIC DIRECTORIES AS AFRICA AREA SPECIALISTS.
OF THE 52 REPLIES, 4 SOON FOLLOWED WITH MATERIAL AND SOME EXPLAINED THAT THEY
WERE STILL USING THEIR RESEARCH MATERIALS, BUT WOULD CONSIDER DONATING THEM AT
A LATER DATE. MISSIONARIES HAVE ALSO BEEN CONTACTED. INCLUDES AN ANNOTATED
LIST OF THE LIBRARY'S ARCHIVAL HOLDINGS.
ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS FOR LIBRARIES.

COMMISSIONED AND PAID FOR BY LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SUBSCRIBERS. DESCRIBES
VARIOUS OPTIONS AVAILABLE NOW/SOON FOR AUTOMATING THE ACQUISITIONS FUNCTION;
DESCRIBES THE IDEAL TECHNOLOGICALLY-FEASIBLE ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM
AGAINST WHICH AVAILABLE SYSTEMS MIGHT BE COMPARED; AND OUTLINES A PROCEDURE
FOR PROCURING THE MOST SUITABLE SYSTEM FOR A PARTICULAR LIBRARY. PRESENTS
QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT SYSTEMS; SPECIFICATIONS FOR A GENERALISED TURNKEY
SYSTEM AND FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITY'S ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEM; AND A LIST OF
VENDORS.
USE STATISTICS: A PLANETARY VIEW.

HISTORICAL STATISTICS FROM THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM WERE PROFILED
AGAINST TOTAL BOOK HOLDINGS AT THE NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER LIBRARY TO
REVEAL INTEREST PATTERNS AND RECENT CHANGES IN USE. THESE STATISTICAL RATIOS
WERE ANALYSED AS A CRITICAL INCREMENT OF AN OVERALL LIBRARY EVALUATION STUDY
TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LIBRARY MET AND ANTICIPATED NEEDS. THE
ANALYSIS RESULTED IN THE STRENGTHENING OF CERTAIN AREAS; IT INITIATED AN
AUTOMATED CHANGE DETECTION MECHANISM, AND IT ACCELERATED THE DECISION TO STORE
USE HISTORY IN THE MACHINE READABLE SHELFLIST RECORD AS A MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA ELEMENT.
SOME ASPECTS OF PATRON-BASED USE ANALYSIS RELEVANT TO ACQUISITIONS.

CONSIDERS USE ANALYSES THAT INVOLVE KNOWING THE TYPE OF PATRON RESPONSIBLE FOR
A PARTICULAR LOAN, RESERVATION REQUEST OR USE OF MATERIAL FROM RESERVE.
ILLUSTRATES WHAT IS POSSIBLE FOR DATA AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF CATEGORISING THE
PATRON. EXAMINES THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR THE LIBRARIAN CARRYING OUT
THE STUDY. DISCUSSES THE PRIVACY DIFFICULTIES OF HISTORICAL RECORDS AND
INDICATES THE OPTIONS OPEN TO THE LIBRARIAN.
THE COLLEGE TEXTBOOK AS A TOOL FOR COLLECTION EVALUATION, ANALYSIS, AND
RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.

THE SEARCH FOR EFFECTIVE METHODS OF PREDICTING BOOK AND JOURNAL USE HAS BEEN A
CENTRAL CONCERN FOR ACQUISITIONS LIBRARIANS. SUGGESTS THE APPLICATION OF
CITATION ANALYSIS TO THE COLLEGE TEXTBOOK AS A MEANS OF EVALUATING, ANALYSING,
AND DEVELOPING BOOK COLLECTIONS IN SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
PRESENTS ARGUMENTS FOR THE RELEVANCE OF TEXTBOOK CITATIONS. A STUDY OF THE
REFERENCES FOUND IN 25 TEXTS IN 5 SEPARATE DISCIPLINES INDICATES THAT THE
TITLES CITED GO FAR BEYOND BASIC CHECKLISTS IN NUMBER AND DEPTH AND THAT MANY
OF THESE TITLES WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN SMALLER ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS
DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO TRADITIONAL METHODS.
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT AT CORNELL. AN INTERIM REPORT ON
ACTIVITIES OF THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' PROJECT FOR COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT. JULY 1977-JUNE 1979.

DESCRIBES THE ASPIRATIONS AND INSPIRATIONS AS WELL AS THE DATA COLLECTION AND
ANALYSES WHICH CONSTITUTED THE 1ST PHASE OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE MELLON
FOUNDATION GRANT TO EXAMINE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT AT CORNELL.

AN ANNOTATED LIST OF OUTSTANDING REFERENCE SOURCES PUBLISHED IN THE USA DURING
1980, COMPILED FOR LIBR. J. BY THE OUTSTANDING REFERENCE SOURCES COMMITTEE,
REFERENCE AND ADULT SERVICES DIVISION, AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. TITLES
WERE SELECTED WITH SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED PUBLIC AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES IN
MIND. ANNUALS, YEARBOOKS, NEW EDITIONS, NEW VOLUMES OF INCOMPLETE SETS,
PAMPHLETS, REFERENCE WORKS OF PURELY LOCAL OR REGIONAL SCOPE, HIGHLY
SPECIALISED AND FOREIGN MATERIALS, AND 'HOW-TO' MANUALS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY
EXCLUDED.
AN OPTIMIZING APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF INTERDEPARTMENTAL ALLOCATION OF THE
LIBRARY MATERIALS BUDGET.

PRESENTS A FORMAL, MATHEMATICALLY EXPRESSED HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE EFFECT
OF LIBRARY SPENDING BY DEPARTMENTS ON PATRON WELFARE; THEN DERIVES A FORMULA
AS THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF MAXIMISING PATRON WELFARE SUBJECT TO THE
BUDGET CONSTRAINT THAT THE SUM OF THE ALLOCATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENTS EQUALS
THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA, THE APPROPRIATE SHARE OF
EACH DEPARTMENT DEPENDS ON ITS NUMBERS, ITS COST OF LITERATURE, AND ON THE
VALUES OF A UTILITY FUNCTION PARAMETER AND A SELECTIVITY FUNCTION PARAMETER.
DISCUSSES MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS, AND GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION USING DATA
FROM THE WESTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY.
EDINBURGH CITY LIBRARIES' ONLINE ORDER EXPERIMENT.

DISCUSSES A PROJECT DEVISED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
DEPARTMENT INVOLVING EDINBURGH CITY LIBRARIES TO TEST AN ON-LINE INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL EXPERIMENT LINKED TO BOOK ORDERING. C. ASKEW & SONS LTD, LIBRARY
SUPPLIERS HAVE A DATA BASE CONTAINING THEIR STOCK FILE, CUSTOMER ORDER FILE,
AND OUTSTANDING ORDER FILE, AND EDINBURGH LIBRARIES ACCESS THE SYSTEM BY VDU.
FILES MAY BE SEARCHED USING STOCK TITLES; ORDER, INVOICING AND REPORTING
INSTRUCTIONS; OUTSTANDING ORDER STATUS; AND STOCK TITLES BY DEWEY NUMBER
RANGE. THE EXPERIMENT IMPROVED THE PERIOD FROM ISSUE TO RECEIPT OF AN ORDER BY
ALMOST A WEEK.
THIRD ANNUAL BATAB USERS' CONFERENCE, 1979: SUMMARY REPORT.

THE THIRD ANNUAL BATAB (BAKER & TAYLOR AUTOMATED BUYING) USERS' CONFERENCE WAS
HELD IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MAY 79. PANEL DISCUSSIONS CENTERED ON DATA ENTRY
COST FACTORS, DATA QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES, USER-DEVELOPED SOFTWARE AND
LINKAGE OF BATAB TO OTHER SYSTEMS. REPORTS WERE PRESENTED CONCERNING THE ADDED
ENHANCEMENTS OF BATAB'S VERSION 4, THE ORGANISATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF
THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED MARKETING SYSTEMS SERVICES DIVISION OF THE BAKER &
TAYLOR COMPANY AND THE NEW ON-LINE ORDERING SYSTEM, LIBRIS.
ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS: USE OF A VENDOR SYSTEM.

REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER GIVEN TO THE ALA RTSD PRE-ORDER AND PRE-CATALOGING
BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING DISCUSSION GROUP, 21 JAN 80. LIBRIS, BAKER AND
TAYLOR'S LIBRARY INFORMATION SERVICE, IS AN ON-LINE BOOK ORDER SYSTEM FIRST
MADE AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIES IN 1979. IN MAR 79, MIAMI UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
BECAME 1 OF 10 PILOT LIBRARIES TESTING LIBRIS. AFTER 3 MONTHS' TESTING, IT WAS
DECIDED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SYSTEM, USING IT FOR ON-LINE ORDERING WITH BAKER
AND TAYLOR, GENERATION OF MULTIPLES TO BE MAILED TO OTHER VENDORS, AND
PREPARATION OF FORM LETTERS OFF-LINE.
TELEORDERING-A LUXURY?.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL. THE AUTHOR IS A
DIRECTOR OF H&A JOHN (BOOKSELLERS) LTD. DISCUSSES THE IMPLEMENTATION AND
OPERATION BY A UK BOOKSELLER OF SOFTWARE SCIENCES TELEORDERING, A COMPUTER
BASED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BETWEEN BOOKSELLERS AND PUBLISHERS USING ISBNS.
GIVES BRIEF TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE HARDWARE USED, AND DESCRIBES A TYPICAL
OPERATION SEQUENCE. SHOWS THAT TELEORDERING IS AN EASY TO USE AND EFFICIENT
MEANS OF SENDING ORDERS AND HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY, CANCELLATIONS AND POSSIBLY
CHASERS. NOTES SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF TELEORDERING FOR LIBRARIANS,
PARTICULARLY THE BETTER SERVICE ON SUPPLY OF BOOKS AND OF REPORTS. SUGGESTS
THAT THE BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION SHOULD CONSIDER
THE POSSIBLE USES OF TELEORDERING TOGETHER.
THE TERMINAL QUESTION FOR WHOLESALERS AND THE BALANCE OF TRADE.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH SOME WHOLESALERS ARE
WELL AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE CANADIAN BOOK DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY IN APPLYING
NEW TECHNOLOGY, THEY MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR APPROACH IF THE DISTRIBUTION
PROCESS IS TO BE AUTOMATED. US AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ARE GEARED TO FAST SERVICE
FROM A NATION-WIDE WHOLESALE CHAIN. CANADA HAS NO SUCH CHAIN AND WHOLESALERS
MAY HAVE TO FORM A CONSORTIUM. A CENTRAL COORDINATING AGENCY HAS BEEN
SUGGESTED IN A STUDY BY PEAT, MARWICK AND MCCARTHY & MCCARTHY. MANY FEEL THE
NEED FOR BETTER STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY IN THE USE OF ISBNS. IF CANADIAN
WHOLESALERS DO NOT ACT QUICKLY, US WHOLESALERS WILL TAKE OVER.
MAKING BOOK ON TELEORDERING: ODDS, FAVOURITES AND LONG SHOTS FOR IN-STORE
SYSTEMS.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON TECHNOLOGY. OUTLINES THE CONTRASTING
ATTITUDES TOWARDS AUTOMATION IN THE CANADIAN BOOK TRADE; DESCRIBES THE
INTRODUCTION INTO CANADA OF IN-STORE AUTOMATION BY BAKER & TAYLOR IN 1979;
OUTLINES THE PROPOSED SYSTEM OF TELEORDERING AND INFORMATION ON BOOKS-IN-PRINT
IN MICROFICHE FORMAT; POINTS OUT THE NEED FOR NATION-WIDE STANDARDISATION IF
SUCH A SYSTEM IS TO WORK; BRIEFLY SURVEYS OTHER SYSTEMS; AND STRESSES THE NEED
FOR AN ECONOMICAL, EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE SYSTEM-BOOK SHOPS OPERATING ON LOW
PROFIT MARGINS CANNOT AFFORD COSTLY EXPERIMENTS.
INFORMATION AND LITERATURE DEMAND.

BETWEEN 1970 AND 78 THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL LITERATURE ORDERS RECEIVED FROM
OUTSIDE BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE IN COLOGNE INCREASED BY NEARLY 400%
TO 210,000. SINCE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICES EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY
DURING THIS PERIOD, THE LIBRARY NEEDED DETAILED INFORMATION ON REQUESTED
MATERIAL FOR FUTURE PLANNING, SO IN 1978 A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE
HELP OF THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION).
INFORMATION FROM 12 LIBRARIES WAS OBTAINED ON THE SOURCES OF ORDERED
LITERATURE, THE USE OF MATERIAL BY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL GROUPS, THE USE OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTS, THE TYPES AND LANGUAGE OF
MATERIAL REQUIRED AND THE TYPE OF LIBRARY MAKING THE REQUEST. THE SURVEY'S
CENTRAL FINDING WAS THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
SERVICES CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCED USER DEMAND. LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR THIS
AND THEIR FINANCING BODIES MUST SUPPORT THEM.
EXTERNAL LENDING STATISTICS FOR LIBRARIES IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA AND
NORTHERN RHINELAND PALATINATE IN 1979.

THE NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
CENTRE PUBLISHED THE 1979 REPORT CONCERNING EXTERNAL LENDING AND BORROWING
STATISTICS. 175 LIBRARIES IN THE REGION WERE AUTHORISED LENDING LIBRARIES IN
1979. THE UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES TO 273 LIBRARIES,
DEPARTMENTS AND GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN THE REGION. 270 OF THESE WERE COMPLETED AND
RETURNED. THE NUMBER OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS LEVELLED OFF IN COMPARISON TO THE
HIGH 1976 FIGURES AND DROPPED IN SOME CASES. THERE WERE SOME EXCEPTIONS SUCH
AS THE COLOGNE ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER MEDIZIN WHICH HAD A GROWTH RATE OF 13%.
THERE WAS A RISE IN BOOKS ORDERED BY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER LIBRARIES OF 3.7%. A
CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF BOOKS LENT TO OTHER LIBRARIES IN
WEST GERMANY AND ABROAD WAS EVIDENT. MORE BOOKS WERE BORROWED BY THE REGIONAL
LIBRARIES THAN WERE SUPPLIED BY THEM AND THE FIGURES FOR BOOKS SUPPLIED
DROPPED IN COMPARISON TO EARLIER STATISTICS.
INTERLIBRARY LOAN COST STUDY AND COMPARISON.

DETAILS HOW MUCH A MANUAL, NON-AUTOMATED ADAPTATION OF VERNON E. PALMOUR'S
STUDY ON INTERLIBRARY LOAN COSTS, CHARACTERISTICS, AND MAGNITUDE WAS DESIGNED
AND IMPLEMENTED TO SHOW ILL COSTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA. IT IS HOPED
THAT OTHER NON-AUTOMATED INSTITUTIONS COULD USE THE OU METHODOLOGY AS A POINT
OF DEPARTURE FOR COST STUDIES OF THEIR OWN. RESULTS OF THE OU STUDY ARE
COMPARED WITH THE PALMOUR STUDY, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1972. THE COST OF A
BORROWING TRANSACTION WAS $4.98 OU, $7.61 PALMOUR. A FILLED LENDING
TRANSACTION COST $5.45 OU, $4.67 PALMOUR, AN UNFILLED LENDING TRANSACTION COST
$5.40 OU, $2.12 PALMOUR.

AN OPERATION IN THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, DELHI, IN 1977 AND
PROVIDES THE COST ANALYSIS.
CRITERIA FOR WEEDING BOOKS IN A UNIVERSITY MUSIC LIBRARY.

GUIDELINES ON WEEDING OF BOOKS IN A UNIVERSITY MUSIC LIBRARY, BASED ON
EXPERIENCE AT THE MUSIC LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY,
WHERE A SAMPLE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DEVELOP QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA FOR
SELECTING BOOKS FOR STORAGE. MEASURABLE INFORMATION OF CIRCULATION RECORDS,
SUBJECT, LANGUAGE AND PUBLICATION DATE WERE USED AND SELECTION WAS MADE ON THE
BASIS OF THESE QUANTITATIVE MEANS TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE APPLICATION
OF SUBJECTIVE QUALITATIVE CRITERIA.
PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF COLLECTIONS IN LIBRARIES.

THIS STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE CARE OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS TO FACE UP TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF NEGLECT AND,
TOGETHER WITH THEIR TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS, TO FORMULATE A POSITIVE
POLICY ON THE FUTURE OF THEIR COLLECTIONS. FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
ARE PRESENTED IN OUTLINE FORMAT UNDER THESE HEADINGS: GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON
CONSERVATION; PROTECTION AGAINST PHYSICAL DAMAGE, BIOLOGICAL DAMAGE, AND
CHEMICAL DAMAGE; GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RESTORATION; RESTORATION OF THE BODY
OF AN ITEM OR OF INDIVIDUAL LEAVES; AND RESTORATION OF BINDINGS. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION.

DANISH VERSION OF THE IFLA PRINCIPLES ON CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION IN
LIBRARIES.
PRESERVATION OF READING MATERIALS IN LIBRARIES: A PRACTICAL APPROACH.

THERE HAS BEEN AN ALARMING INCREASE IN THE DETERIORATION OF READING MATERIALS
IN LIBRARIES, DUE TO CARELESS HANDLING BY LIBRARY STAFF AND READERS. CAREFUL
HANDLING, PROPER SHELVING AND TIMELY BINDING CAN CHECK FUTURE DAMAGE.
DESCRIBES SOME IMPORTANT PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND INSECT
CONTROL.
THE PROVENANCE AND PRESERVATION OF ARCHITECTURAL RECORDS.

DISCUSSES THE POTENTIAL PRESERVABILITY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF ARCHITECTURAL
RECORDS, BOTH PAST AND PRESENT, AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBES SEVERAL PROCESSES FOR
PRESERVING AND REPRODUCING DRAWINGS AND PRINTS. CONSIDERS SOME PROBLEMS
CONCERNED WITH THE PRESERVATION OF RECORDS GENERATED BY COMPUTERS, TO WHICH
ARCHITECTS ARE TURNING IN INCREASING NUMBERS.
REBIND, RESTORE, REINVENT AND REDISCOVER.

REVIEW OF PAST AND LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN THE LIBRARY BINDING INDUSTRY, WITH
COMMENTS ON MARKETING, ECONOMIC PRESSURES, BINDER/LIBRARIAN RELATIONS,
STANDARDS, MICROFILM AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS.
BOOK THEFT AND LIBRARY SECURITY SYSTEMS, 1981-82.

DISCUSSES THE FOLLOWING TOPICS: MEASURING BOOK LOSS; THEFT PREVENTION
PROGRAMMES-ELECTRONIC SECURITY SYSTEMS; BOOKSTORES; LIBRARY USERS' REPORTS ON
ELECTRONIC SECURITY SYSTEMS; ALTERNATIVES TO THESE SYSTEMS; AND JOURNAL,
NON-PRINT, AND SPECIAL COLLECTION PROTECTION. QUOTES THE MISSISSIPPI LIBRARY
MATERIALS SECURITY ACT AND LISTS US LIBRARIES USING ELECTRONIC SECURITY
SYSTEMS.
LENDING MUSIC IN TAMPERE.

THE TAMPERE CITY LIBRARY STARTED AN EXPERIMENTAL MUSIC LENDING SERVICE IN
1975. 3 YEARS LATER THE SERVICE WAS ESTABLISHED PERMANENTLY. THE MUSIC WORKING
GROUP OF THE LIBRARY REPORTS THAT A RECORD LASTS ABOUT 40-50 LOANS AND
RETURNED RECORDS ARE GENERALLY IN GOOD CONDITION. BETWEEN 1975-79 ABOUT 81,000
RECORDS WERE LOANED. THE EXPERIENCES FROM THE SERVICES ARE ONLY POSITIVE.
THERE ARE ABOUT 4,000 RECORDS IN STOCK. THEY ARE LOANED FOR 7 WEEKS. THE
LIBRARY ALSO HAS LISTENING FACILITIES.
NEW CIRCULATION SYSTEM AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY.

DISCUSSES THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM AT NEWCASTLE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE MAIN FILES INCLUDE DETAILS OF ALL BOOKS ON LOAN,
BORROWERS, A STOCK RECORD FILE AND SERIALS TITLE FILE, ALL OF WHICH MAY BE
INTERROGATED BY A VDU TERMINAL. THE SYSTEM CAN GENERATE HOUSEKEEPING
STATISTICS, AND IS NORMALLY RUN IN BATCH MODE. THE SYSTEM'S OPERATION IS
DESCRIBED, AS IS ITS CONFIGURATION. IT IS SEEN TO BE FLEXIBLE AND THERE ARE
POSSIBILITIES FOR VARYING THE USE OF THE HARDWARE POINT TO ITS APPLICABILITY
IN OTHER TYPES AND SIZES OF LIBRARY.
COMPUTER APPLICATION TO LIBRARY CIRCULATION CONTROL.

DISCUSSES A POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ON-LINE CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM,
COVERING DESIGN OBJECTIVES; SYSTEM OVERVIEW; HARDWARE AND ASSOCIATED COSTS;
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS; CHARGE, DISCHARGE, RENEWAL, AND HOLD REQUEST
TRANSACTIONS; RESERVATIONS; AND BATCH PROCESSING.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE HERTFORDSHIRE LIBRARY SERVICE.

(ABRIDGED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE IN THE HERTS LIBRARY SERVICE'S 'LIBRARY
AUTOMATION PROJECT NEWSLETTER NO. 7'.) HERTFORDSHIRE LIBRARY SERVICE HAS
AWARDED A CONTRACT TO AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS (ALS) FOR AN ON-LINE
CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM. ALS WILL BE USING EXISTING BAR CODES TO PERMIT THE
ISSUE, RETURN, RENEWAL AND RESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, WITH ON-LINE
BORROWER REGISTRATION AND ENQUIRY AND ON-LINE BOOK ACCESSIONING AND ENQUIRY TO
A SHORT ENTRY CATALOGUE. ACCESS WILL BE BY ACRONYMIC KEYS TO AUTHOR AND TITLE,
BY CONTROL NUMBER AND CLASS NUMBER. IF ALL GOES WELL, HITCHIN AND HEMEL
HEMPSTEAD WILL 'GO LIVE' TO THE PUBLIC AT THE END OF 1981.
A PROBLEM OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM CONTROL AND PRINCIPLES OF SOLVING
PROBLEMS OF EVALUATION.

DISCUSSES THOSE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM EVALUATION PROBLEMS WHICH ARE
CONNECTED WITH SYSTEMS CONTROL; PROPOSES AN APPROACH TO THEIR SOLUTION;
FORMULATES THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE APPROACH; AND PRESENTS A METHOD OF
ISOLATING EVALUATION PROBLEM CLASSES WITH SIMILAR SOLUTION MODELS.
CATALOGING AND CLASSIFICATION: AN INTRODUCTION.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES OF LIBRARY CATALOGUING AND
CLASSIFICATION, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING,
SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION.
DECIDING THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOG IN SMALL LIBRARIES.

IN JAN 81, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CLOSED ITS CARD CATALOGUE AND ADOPTED AACR
2 (THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES, 2ND EDITION). NOW, EVERY US LIBRARY
MUST DECIDE UPON THE FUTURE OF ITS CATALOGUE IN THE FACE OF THESE DECISIONS.
EACH MUST DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE AACR 2, AND IF SO, WHEN TO IMPLEMENT
IT. PRESENTS A CHECKLIST WHICH WILL AID THE LIBRARY IN ITS PLANNING, WITH A
BRIEF BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ITEMS RELATING TO THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOGUE VIS-A-VIS
THE NEW CODE.
CAROLINGIAN MONASTIC LIBRARY CATALOGS AND MEDIEVAL CLASSIFICATION OF KNOWLEDGE.

A STUDY OF MEDIEVAL MONASTIC LIBRARY CATALOGUES, CONCERNED WITH THE PRINCIPLES
OF CONSTRUCTION OF A CATALOGUE AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE NEEDS AND VALUES OF THE
USERS OF THE LIBRARIES THEY RECORD, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF A CATALOGUE AS A
CULTURAL ARTIFACT TO THE INTELLECTUAL MILIEU OF ITS TIME. BASED MOSTLY ON 4
CATALOGUES OF THE CAROLINGIAN PERIOD OF THE 9TH AND 10TH CENTURIES. COMPARES
ASPECTS OF CLASSIFICATION USED IN THE CAROLINGIAN AND LATER PERIODS.
THE USE OF PRINTED CARDS OF THE ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY.

4 YEARS AGO THE REGIONAL LIBRARY OF THE VORONEZH STATE UNIVERSITY INTRODUCED A
NEW METHOD OF USING THE PRINTED CARDS OF THE ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER. IN THE
PAST, THE LIBRARY STAFF HAD TO FILL IN 7 FULL SETS OF THE CARDS, DESPITE THE
FACT THAT ONLY 20-30% OF THE CARDS WERE ACTUALLY USED IN CATALOGUES. INSTEAD
OF FULL SETS THE LIBRARY NOW USES SERIAL SETS. DEPENDING ON THE SUBJECT OF THE
CATALOGUED DOCUMENT (FOR EXAMPLE LITERATURE ON HUMANITIES IS INCLUDED IN 3
CATALOGUES), 1-8 COPIES OF THE SERIAL SET CARDS ARE FILLED IN. THEIR USE
RESULTED IN A CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL SAVING AND IN REDUCED LABOUR CONSUMPTION.
THE PROCESSING OF THE PRINTED CARDS IS DESCRIBED.
A COST-ANALYSIS OF CATALOGUING AT THE UNIVERSITY SAINS MALAYSIA LIBRARY FOR
1975.

THE UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED IN JUNE 69 WITH 50
BOOKS. BY DEC 75, THE NUMBER OF ACCESSIONED ITEMS STOOD AT 139,440. DESCRIBES
A COST ANALYSIS OF CATALOGUING PER TITLE AND PER ADDED TITLE FOR ITEMS ALREADY
CATALOGUED, BASED ON 1974 PRICES.
THE CATALOGUE OF THE FUTURE AND THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOGUE.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CATALOGUING METHODS IN RELATION TO TECHNICAL
RESOURCES, FOCUSING CHIEFLY ON THE ADVENT OF AUTOMATION, AND THE REPLACEMENT
OF THE CATALOGUE BY THE DATA BANK, WITH THE CONSEQUENCES FOR INFORMATION
WORKERS AND USERS.
THE CATALOGUING REVOLUTION (SPECIAL FEATURE).

SPECIAL FEATURE COMPRISING 5 SHORT ARTICLES ON THE REVOLUTION CURRENTLY TAKING
PLACE IN CATALOGUING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY
INTO A TRADITIONALLY MANUAL PROFESSIONAL AREA. ARTICLES ARE AS FOLLOWS: I
SAY..., BY PETER LEWIS; COMPUTER CATALOGUES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY ROY HUSE;
COOPERATIVES: AN INSIDER'S VIEW, BY IAN LOVECY; WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE UK'S
COMPUTER-BASED CATALOGUING AND CATALOGUES? BY RICHARD HUDSON; AND CHANGE AND
CHALLENGE, BY ALAN SEAL.
THE MEDIA INDEX: COMPUTER-BASED ACCESS TO NONPRINT MATERIALS.

ALTHOUGH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO NON-PRINT MATERIALS HAS BEEN A GOAL OF
LIBRARIES, COMPLETE SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THE LIBRARY AT CALIFORNIA
STATE UNIVERSITY, LOS ANGELES, SOUGHT A WAY TO ACCESS PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE
ELEMENTS OF ITS RECORDINGS COLLECTION. THE COMPUTER-BASED MEDIA INDEX WAS
DESIGNED WITH SEPARATE INDEXES FOR TITLES, SUBJECTS, AND ADDED ENTRIES
(SELECTIONS, COMPOSERS, PERFORMERS, ETC.). THIS HAS PROVED TO BE AN EXTREMELY
USEFUL TOOL AND IS READILY ADAPTABLE TO OTHER FORMS OF MEDIATED MATERIAL.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

A TRUE ON-LINE CATALOGUE REQUIRES BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS OF AT LEAST 350-400
CHARACTERS PER TITLE, A MINIMUM OF 6 ACCESS POINTS, AND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
TERMINALS TO OFFER ALL USERS PROMPT ACCESS. A LIBRARY MAY DEVELOP AN ON-LINE
CATALOGUE BY PURCHASING SOFTWARE FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY OR JOINING A TURNKEY
SYSTEM WHEREBY A COMPANY PROVIDES ALL HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, INSTALLATION,
TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE AT A CONTRACTED PRICE. ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN
EXAMINING THE OPTIONS INCLUDE DATA BASE CONTENT, FULLNESS OF RECORDS,
AUTHORITY CONTROL, ACCESS KEYS, BOOLEAN LOGIC, USER FRIENDLINESS, DISPLAY
FORMATS, SECURITY, AND BACK-UP PROVISION. LIBRARIES UNDERTAKING ON-LINE
CATALOGUES IN 1981 ARE PIONEERS.
RESEARCH REPORT ON AN OVERVIEW OF A PROPOSAL MONITORING FACILITY FOR THE
LARGE-SCALE, NETWORK-BASED OCLC ON-LINE SYSTEM.

ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF MEASURING AND EVALUATING INFORMATION
SYSTEMS FUNCTIONING WITHIN COMPUTER NETWORK ENVIRONMENTS. THE FOCUS IS ON THE
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH USING AUTOMATED MONITORING AS THE PRIMARY
INFORMATION SYSTEM MEASUREMENT MECHANISM WITHIN SUCH COMPUTING ARCHITECTURES.
THE LARGE SCALE, NETWORK-BASED, STATE-OF-THE-ART OCLC ON-LINE SYSTEM IS
UTILISED AS THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT IN SUPPORT OF THESE RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
INTERFACING THE NETWORKS THAT KEEP LIBRARIES ON-LINE.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON TECHNOLOGY. UTLAS (UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS) IS AN ANCILLARY ENTERPRISE OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH
A COMPLETELY SEPARATE BUDGET AND HAS BEEN SUPPLYING COMPUTER SERVICES TO
CANADIAN LIBRARIES SINCE 1973. THESE SERVICES CENTRED ON CATALOGUE SUPPORT
UNTIL RECENTLY, BUT THERE ARE NEW PILOT PROJECTS ON ACQUISITIONS, ON-LINE
CIRCULATION CONTROL, AND ON-LINE CATALOGUE ENQUIRIES. UTLAS CAN ALSO PROVIDE
DATA TO FEED OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO OFFER LIBRARIES A
COMPLETE SERVICE IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH OTHER SYSTEMS VENDORS BUT WITH THE
ADVANTAGE OF ITS 10-MILLION ITEM DATA BASE. PUBLISHERS ARE SEEN AS A PART OF
THE EVENTUAL UTLAS NETWORK.
OCLC: ITS GOVERNANCE, FUNCTION, FINANCING AND TECHNOLOGY.

ANALYSES THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OCLC, USING PRIMARY SOURCE MATERIALS
INCLUDING OCLC INCORPORATION DOCUMENTS, MINUTES OF MEETINGS AND GOVERNANCE
DOCUMENTS. CHAPTERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF OCLC-1967 TO THE
PRESENT; GOVERNANCE, FUNCTION, FINANCING, AND TECHNOLOGY OF OCLC; AND AN OCLC
CRITIQUE.
COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ACQUISITIONS AND CATALOGUING WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE
TO MARC.

EXPLAINS WHAT MARC TAPES ARE; MARC RECORD FORMAT; AND SEARCHING MARC TAPES FOR
A PARTICULAR RECORD. DISCUSSES THE USE OF MARC IN COMPUTERISED ACQUISITIONS
AND CATALOGUING PROCEDURES. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE OHIO COLLEGE LIBRARY CENTER
AND BIRMINGHAM LIBRARIES CO-OPERATIVE MECHANIZATION PROJECT COMPUTERISED
CATALOGUING SERVICES.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF MICROFICHES.

PROVIDES SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION FOR MICROFICHE.
THE STANDARDS MENTIONED COME INTO FORCE IN 1982 BUT THE EXPERIENCE OF
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES MAY PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A COMMON
PRACTICE.
RESEARCH REPORT ON ANALYTICAL REVIEW OF CATALOG USE STUDIES.

TAKES A CRITICAL APPROACH IN SUMMARISING AND EVALUATING THE METHODOLOGY AND
SCOPE OF CATALOGUE USE STUDIES, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE SUBJECT APPROACH TO CARD
CATALOGUE SEARCHING. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE WAR OF AACR 2: VICTORS OR VICTIMS?.

THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION)-AACR 2-PROVIDE A CASE STUDY
OF ACHIEVEMENT, CONTROVERSY, AND FAILURE. WHILE PROPONENTS APPLAUD THE
'INTERNAL HARMONY' OF AACR 2, OBSERVERS NOTE THE SACRIFICES ALREADY MADE TO
TRANSATLANTIC EXPENDIENTS AND CRITICS SEEK TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. DISCUSSES
THE REVISION OF AACR AND EXPLORES THE ACTIONS AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES OF VARIOUS
PARTICIPANTS TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONFLICT. THE LACK OF
SUPPORT FOR AACR 2 CAN BE EXPLAINED PARTIALLY BY THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ITS
IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, THE DIFFICULTY OF JUSTIFYING ITS BENEFITS, AND THE
FEELING THAT IT INTRUDES ON MORE IMPORTANT LOCAL PRIORITIES. MAKES SOME
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEXT AACR REVISION.
REPORT OF SUBCOMMITTEE 2 ON AACR2 OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF THE
CARD CATALOG OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LIBRARY.

THE RESULT OF A STUDY WHICH COMPARED THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES, 2ND
EDITION (AACR 2), WITH CURRENT CATALOGUING PRACTICES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
CINCINNATI LIBRARIES, THIS REPORT CONTAINS CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER COMMENTARY ON
THE FOLLOWING AREAS: THE CATALOGUING PHILOSOPHY OF AACR 2; GENERAL RULES FOR
DESCRIPTION; BOOKS, PAMPHLETS, AND PRINTED SHEETS; CARTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS;
MANUSCRIPTS, INCLUDING MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS; MUSIC; SOUND RECORDINGS; MOTION
PICTURES AND VIDEORECORDINGS; GRAPHIC MATERIALS; MACHINE-READABLE DATA FILES;
3-DIMENSIONAL ARTIFACTS AND REALIA; MICROFORMS; SERIALS; ANALYSIS OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC MATERIALS; HEADINGS, UNIFORM TITLES, AND REFERENCES; CHOICE OF
ACCESS POINTS; HEADINGS FOR PERSONS; GEOGRAPHIC NAMES; HEADINGS FOR CORPORATE
BODIES; UNIFORM TITLES; REFERENCES; AND APPENDICES. EXAMPLES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS ARE PROVIDED, AND THE AP PENDIX INCLUDES A GUIDE TO MICROFORMS. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SERIAL CATALOGUING: A COMPARISON OF AACR 1 AND +2.

AIMS TO INSTRUCT THOSE FAMILIAR WITH SERIALS CATALOGUING PRACTICES AND
PROCEDURES ABOUT RULES RELATING TO SERIALS IN AACR 2. COMPARISON IS MADE
BETWEEN AACR 1 AND +2, AND EXAMPLES OF CATALOGUING PRACTICE ARE GIVEN.
SYSTEM OF IMPRINTS. REPORT AND PROPOSALS.

A DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCO-BRITISH PROJECT OF 15 YEARS' DURATION TO DEVELOP A
FORMULA FOR MATCHING ALL COPIES OF THE SAME EDITION, FOR USE IN COMPILING AN
AUTOMATED UNION CATALOGUE OF OLD BOOKS. THE AGREED METHOD IS DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL, WITH EXAMPLES OF CASES WHERE IT APPLIES EASILY, AND A REPORT ON
RESEARCH TO ESTABLISH THE INCIDENCE OF FALLIBILITY, AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.
THE FUNCTION AND APPLICATION OF THE FORMULA IN CATALOGUING IS DEMONSTRATED,
WITH PROPOSALS THAT ITS USE BE EXTENDED TO COMPLEMENT TRADITIONAL CATALOGUING
PRACTICE AND SHOW THE HISTORY OF A TEXT BY ESTABLISHING 'FAMILIES OF
IMPRINTS'. THE GUIDE FOR USERS, TO BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY, IS REPRODUCED IN AN
APPENDIX.
RESEARCH REPORT. CODOC REVISED: THE TREATMENT OF OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS AT
MONTREAL ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE.

DISCUSSES EXPERIENCE WITH THE CODOC AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR LOCAL TREATMENT OF
OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS. THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTLINED AND ITS
RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND INCONVENIENCES ANALYSED AND WEIGHED. AFTER 2 YEARS,
THE ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE WITHDREW FROM THE GROUP PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT
DISPARITY OF FORMS OF ENTRY FOR 1 SINGLE ORGANISATION, AND INSTEAD CREATED ITS
OWN APPROACH USING THE CATSS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. THE MODIFICATIONS MADE IN
ADAPTING ELEMENTS OF BOTH SYSTEMS TO MEET ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE REQUIREMENTS ARE
DESCRIBED, AND THE OPERATION OF THE NEW SYSTEM TO DATE EVALUATED.
AN ONLINE UNION LIST OF SERIALS: MEETING THE USER NEEDS.

REPORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE OF SERIALS USING OCLC
BY THE CENTRAL NEW YORK LIBRARY RESOURCES COUNCIL. THE PROJECT IS CONVERTING
FROM A HARD COPY UNION CATALOGUE OF SERIALS TO AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE THAT WILL
HAVE THE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF IMMEDIATE UPDATE. USING THE OCLC INTERLIBRARY
LOAN SUBSYSTEM, THE INQUIRING LIBRARY MAY LOOK AT A DISPLAY OF LIBRARY
HOLDINGS AND FIND UP TO 5 LOCATIONS FOR A GIVEN SERIAL.
THE EARLY IMPRINTS PROJECT IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

BASED ON A TALK BY THE AUTHOR (ONE OF THE ORIGINATORS OF THE EARLY IMPRINTS
PROJECT (EIP) AND CHAIRMAN OF THE EIP SOUTH AUSTRALIAN COMMITTEE) TO THE
FRIENDS OF THE STATE LIBRARY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA, MAY 80. THE PROJECT AIMS TO
LIST ALL MATERIALS PRINTED BEFORE 1801 HELD IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. IT
HAD ITS BEGINNINGS IN ADELAIDE IN 1976 AND, WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS, HAS NOW
BECOME ESTABLISHED WITH REPRESENTATIVES IN EACH AUSTRALIAN STATE AND NEW
ZEALAND. THE TARGET DATE FOR THE PUBLICATION OF A CATALOGUE (IN BOTH PRINTED
AND MACHINE-READABLE FORMS) IS 1988; THE LISTING OF SOUTH AUSTRALIAN MATERIAL
SHOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 1981.
INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES.

INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES IS A STRICT CONTINUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT FROM
COORDINATE TO SYNTACTIC INDEXING. NOMINAL PHRASES ARE USER ORIENTED AND
ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR COMPLEX TERMS. A NOMINAL PHRASE CONSISTS OF A NUCLEUS
WITH A LEFT-HAND AND/OR RIGHT-HAND ATTRIBUTE. ATTRIBUTE AND NUCLEUS CAN OCCUR
SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SAME HIERARCHIC LEVEL. THE USE OF NOMINAL PHRASE INDEXING
IS ILLUSTRATED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF 3 MANUAL INDEXING SYSTEMS-TITUS, CASIN AND
GERDOK-AND 1 AUTOMATIC SYSTEM-DETECT. IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING WITH NOMINAL
PHRASES A COMPLETE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS IS UNNECESSARY; EVEN SYSTEMS WITH
PARTIAL PARSING ROUTINES PRODUCE ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. THE PROBLEM OF RETRIEVAL
WITH NOMINAL PHRASES IS STILL UNSOLVED.
BLISS BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION: CLASS H-ANTHROPOLOGY, HUMAN BIOLOGY,
HEALTH SCIENCES. 2ND EDITION.

RADICAL REVISION AND EXPANSION OF CLASS H IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION,
EDITION 1.
THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE-WHAT DO THEY REALLY DO?.

THE NORWEGIAN DEWEY COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE LIBRARY SERVICE AND
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE TO ADVISE ON DEWEY CLASSIFICATION IN NORWAY. ITS
NEW GEOGRAPHICAL TABLES (SUGGESTIONS, NOT INSTRUCTIONS), AIM TO HELP, FOR
INSTANCE, LIBRARIES WITH LARGE LOCAL COLLECTIONS. BASICALLY THEY FOLLOW DDC
19, DIVIDING NORWAY INTO 4 MAIN SECTIONS (AS AGAINST THE EARLIER ARNESEN
DIVISION INTO 3) WITH FURTHER DIVISIONS BY COUNTY, DISTRICT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITY. COMMENTS FROM LIBRARIES WERE INVITED: 1 SUGGESTION THAT ARNESEN
NOTATION SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR NORTH NORWAY HAS BEEN ACCEPTED FOR FUTURE US
EDITIONS. A NEW EDITION OF ARNESEN (THE CURRENT NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY,
BASED ON DDC 17) IS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
THERE WILL BE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE 300 CLASSES, CORRESPONDING TO DDC 19.
SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES, NOTES AND INDEXES WILL BE IMPROVED, AND LIBRARIES WILL
BE ABLE TO CLASSIFY BROADLY OR MORE PRECISELY AS REQUIRED.
DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION, 18TH ED. TABLE 2. AREAS EXPANSION FOR MALAYSIA
(-595).

THE 14TH DRAFT, DRAWN UP BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MALAYSIA CATALOGUING
COMMITTEE AFTER CONSULTATION WITH 40 LOCAL EXPERTS AND LIBRARIANS. INCLUDES
MAPS SHOWING AREAS ASSIGNED EXPANSIONS AND ENUMERATES THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES
UPON WHICH THE WORK WAS BASED.
LAW OPTIONS IN DEWEY 19.

THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION, 19TH EDITION, OFFERS 4 OPTIONS IN THE
CLASSIFICATION OF LAW. DEWEY'S RECOMMENDATION GROUPS MATERIAL PRIMARILY BY
BRANCH OF LAW: OPTION 1 GIVES PRIORITY TO THE PREFERRED JURISDICTION AND ITS
SUBORDINATE JURISDICTIONS; 2 ARRANGES BY JURISDICTION; AND 3 CLASSES LAW OF A
SPECIFIC DISCIPLINE OR SUBJECT WITH THAT DISCIPLINE OR SUBJECT. DISCUSSES THE
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE 4 OPTIONS, FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON THEIR
IMPLICATIONS FOR PAPUA NEW GUINEA. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR VARIOUS TYPES
OF LIBRARY.
DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION, 18TH ED. SCHEDULES: HISTORY EXPANSION FOR
MALAYSIA (959.5).

PRESENTS THE 10TH DRAFT PREPARED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MALAYSIA
CATALOGUING COMMITTEE AFTER CONSULTATION WITH 40 LOCAL EXPERTS AND LIBRARIANS
AND ENUMERATES THE GENERAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED.
A CHALLENGE TO CHANGE: NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
FOR THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

ADDRESSES THE FEASIBILITY OF CHANGING THE CLASSIFICATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS
IN THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARIES FROM THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEM (DDC) TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SYSTEM (LC), THUS PATTERNING THE CITY
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AFTER THE CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY AND STRENGTHENING THE
EXISTING CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 2 SYSTEMS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
LC OR DEWEY?.

REVIEWS THE LIBRARY'S CHOICE BETWEEN USE OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION
AND THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CLASSIFICATION. TRACES THE HISTORY OF EACH SCHEME,
AND DISCUSSES THE CONVERSION BY MANY LIBRARIES FROM DEWEY TO LC. COSTS OF
CONVERSION ARE ASSESSED.
CLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTATION ON GLUING AND GLUES USING UDC. PRACTICAL
RECOMMENDATIONS.

CLASSIFICATION OF LITERATURE CONTAINING INFORMATION ON GLUES AND GLUING IS A
DIFFICULT TASK AS THERE ARE SEVERAL CLASSES WITHIN THE UDC SYSTEM WITH ALMOST
IDENTICAL MEANING. THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN CHEMISTRY CARRIED OUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE UDC
CLASSES AVAILABLE FOR CLASSIFICATION OF GLUES AND GLUING PROCESSES AND
PREPARED RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO USE THE UDC SYSTEM FOR CLASSIFICATION OF
GLUES AND GLUING. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED.
AUTOMATIC KEYWORD IN CONTEXT (KWIC) INDEXING.

DEFINES THE PROCESS OF INDEXING AND ENUMERATES THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN
INDEXING. DISCUSSES THE PRINCIPLES OF AUTOMATIC INDEXING AND PRESENTS AN
OVERVIEW OF KWIC INDEXING, ITS ORIGINS AND PRODUCTION METHODS. ILLUSTRATES THE
STRUCTURE OF KWIC INDEXES USING THE ANALOGY OF A HORIZONTAL WHEEL AND A
CAMERA. STRESSES THAT CONTINUITY OF CONTEXT AT THE EXTREME EDGES SHOULD BE
MAINTAINED WHENEVER THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF A TITLE FORMS THE PART OF A
KWIC ENTRY. SUGGESTS AN 'ALTERED KWIC' (AKWIC) FORMAT. COMPARES TITLE AND
SUBJECT PERMUTATION FOR KWIC PRODUCTION, AND ENCOURAGES THE ADOPTION OF KWIC
INDEX BY INDIAN PERIODICALS.
SUBJECT HEADING LIST.

THE PRESENT FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST DATES FROM 1941. A SUBJECT HEADING
PILOT WORKING GROUP SET UP BY THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS COMPLETED
ITS PILOT SURVEY. THE GROUP INCLUDED LIBRARIANS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF
LIBRARIES. THE PURPOSES OF THE PILOT WAS TO RECOMMEND THAT A COMPILATION OF A
SUBJECT HEADING LIST SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AND TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WORK. THE LIST WOULD SERVE ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES AND
WOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN A CLASSIFICATION. A THESAURUS STRUCTURE WOULD BE
BEST FOR THE PURPOSE. THE LIST SHOULD INCLUDE BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000 TERMS.
A WORKING GROUP SHOULD BE SET UP BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION THIS YEAR. THE
BUDGET FOR THE WORK LASTING 3 YEARS IS ESTIMATED AT 385,000 FINN MARKS.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBJECT INDEX FOR THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.

IN MAY 80 THE JOINT WORKING PARTIES ON THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE
DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTRE PUBLISHED THEIR FINAL REPORT CONTAINING
PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE NETHERLANDS BASED ON BRINKMANN'S
CATALOGUE OF BOOKS. IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF TERMS USED IN THE SUBJECT
INDEX OF BRINKMANN'S CATALOGUE IT WAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT THE THESAURUS OF
HEADINGS DEVELOPED BY THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) WITH THE ADDITION OF UDC AND SISO
CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS TO EACH ENTRY. A TEST-RUN HAS IDENTIFIED A CORE OF SOME
3,500 HEADINGS WHICH WILL BE INPUT INTO THE DATA BASE TO PROVIDE A SUBJECT
INDEX TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ON 1 JAN 81.
SYSTEMS APPROACH TO DESIGN AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION IN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS.

DEFINES THE PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM KNOWN AS A LIBRARY; IDENTIFIES THE
COMPONENTS OF A LARGE ORGANISATION'S INFORMATION SYSTEM; PRESENTS THE CASE FOR
COMPUTERISATION OF INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL; AND DISCUSSES DIFFERENT
ASPECTS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS (EQUIPMENT, RETRIEVAL PROCESS, GENERIC
SEARCHES, AND ON-LINE SYSTEMS).
COMPUTER PROCESSING OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THESES.

DESCRIBES THE WORK UNDERTAKEN BY THE CHAIR OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND
LIBRARIANSHIP AT THE FACULTY OF PHILOSOPHY, CHARLES UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE. FOR
THE COMPUTER PROCESSING OF THESES, SYSTEM ASTI WAS APPLIED. BY PRODUCING
VARIED TYPES OF INDEXES, THIS SYSTEM ENABLES A WIDE ACCESS TO THE STORED DATA.
ITS SCOPE CAN BE ENLARGED TO INCLUDE THESES ON A NATIONAL SCALE.
THE GREAT INFO DANGER.

PRESENTS, IN THE PROFESSOR'S OWN WORDS, THE GLOOMY PREDICTION OF PROFESSOR
JOSEPH WEIZENBAUM (COMPUTER SCIENCE LECTURER AT MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF
TECHNOLOGY) THAT AN INFORMATION CATASTROPHE IS AHEAD. HE PAINTS A PICTURE OF
THE BLIND (COMPUTER SPECIALISTS) LEADING THE BLIND (COMPUTER USERS) THROUGH A
MINEFIELD OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY WHICH NOBODY UNDERSTANDS AND WHICH HAS ALREADY
SHOWN THAT IT IS CAPABLE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS. COMPUTER SPECIALISTS
DO NOT UNDERSTAND MODERN COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND CANNOT PREDICT HOW THEY WILL
OPERATE. THEY CANNOT, THEREFORE, CONTROL THEM.
AN ADDITION AND IMPROVEMENT FOR DATA BASES: SINTEX, A STATISTICAL TOOL.

A DESCRIPTION OF AN INDEXING SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY THE SOCIETE D'INFORMATIQUE
EUROPEENE, DESIGNED TO OVERCOME THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF DATA BASE
COMMUNICATION CAUSED BY THE HETEROGENEITY OF INDEXING TECHNIQUES, MATERIAL
STORED AND INTERROGATION LANGUAGES. THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND SINTEX ARE
EXPLAINED, AND BATCH AND ON-LINE APPLICATIONS OUTLINED, SHOWING HOW IT COULD
OPERATE AS AN ENTIRELY AUTOMATIC INDEXING SYSTEM. EVENTUALLY SINTEX SHOULD
PERMIT UNRESTRICTED INDEXING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE DATA BASE INTERROGATION.
EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF THE OPTIMUM RETRIEVAL STRATEGY USED IN AUTOMATED
SYSTEMS.

AN EXPERIMENT TO FIND THE OPTIMUM INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD FOR THE
AUTOMATED SYSTEM AS USED BY THE TOP MANAGEMENT ORGANS OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY
OF ENGINEERING AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT DEVELOPMENT IS DESCRIBED. BY MEANS OF A
COMBINATION OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS, DESCRIBED HERE, 16 METHODS WERE OBTAINED
WHICH WERE THEN TESTED USING A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF DOCUMENTS DEALING WITH
TOP MANAGEMENT AND SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION. THE
RETRIEVAL EFFICIENCY OF EACH METHOD WAS EVALUATED BY MEANS OF COEFFICIENTS
INTENDED TO QUANTIFY THE DEGREE OF RETRIEVAL COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY.
THE UNESCO CDS/ISIS SYSTEM.

UNESCO'S CDS/ISIS (COMPUTERISED DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM/INTEGRATED SET OF
INFORMATION SYSTEMS) IS A GENERALISED COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEM FOR INFORMATION
PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND RETRIEVAL, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE IN
1975. IN RESPONSE TO INTERNATIONAL INTEREST, IT IS NOW AVAILABLE TO
ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED NATIONS FAMILY AND MEMBER STATES, WITHOUT CHARGE.
UNESCO TRAINS USERS, REGULARLY INFORMS THEM OF SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS, VISITS
THEM, OFFERS TECHNICAL ADVICE, AND HAS PUBLISHED BACK-UP DOCUMENTATION.
SELECTION LANGUAGES SUITABLE FOR AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF LEGAL INFORMATION.

THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHOICE AND FORMULATION OF A SELECTION LANGUAGE TO BE
APPLIED IN THE AUTOMATED LEGAL INFORMATION SYSTEM IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST
REPUBLIC ARE DISCUSSED. BASED ON THESE, 2 SELECTION LANGUAGES WERE PREFERRED:
THE 'RUBRICATOR' LANGUAGE, USING HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION, AND THE
DESCRIPTOR TYPE LANGUAGE, BASED ON A THESAURUS OF LEGAL KEYWORDS. BOTH OF
THESE ARE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL AND EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN.
A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF REQUEST GENERATION PROCESS TO DATA BASE.

ON THE BASIS OF A FORMALISED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS OF USER ACCESS TO A
DATA BASE AT A TERMINAL, BUILDS A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF
INFORMATION REQUESTS FOR VARIOUS TIME INTERVALS AND DETERMINES THE PARAMETERS
OF USER ACCESS.
EDGE-NOTCHED CARDS: PREMATURELY BURIED.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND APPLICATIONS OF
EDGE-NOTCHED CARDS, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PREMATURELY RETIRED IN THE WEST, BUT
ARE STILL THE SUBJECT OF A NUMBER OF ARTICLES EMANATING FROM THE EAST.
AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO INFORMATION.
(FOREIGN PRESS MATERIALS).

DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE PRINCIPLES OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND
POINTS OUT THAT ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS 5 TO 10 TIMES FASTER THAN
MANUAL RETRIEVAL. LISTS THE DISADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEMS: THE
BUILDING OF DATA BASES IS A COMPLEX TASK; DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION IS
UNAVOIDABLE; THE COSTS ARE HIGH AND STAFF MUST BE TRAINED TO USE THESE
SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, STAFF MUST LEARN A NUMBER OF 'COMMAND LANGUAGES' BECAUSE
OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE. THIS PROBLEM COULD PERHAPS
BE OVERCOME BY USING 'TRANSPARENT SYSTEMS' WHICH FUNCTION AS AN INTERFACE, OR
'A TRANSLATOR', BETWEEN THE SEARCHER AND THE MACHINE. IN THIS CASE THE
SEARCHER WOULD ONLY NEED ONE COMMAND LANGUAGE.
BASICS OF ONLINE SEARCHING.

PRESENTS A UNIFIED PICTURE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING BY COMPUTER, THROUGH AN
EXAMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERACTIVE ON-LINE SEARCHING. EXAMPLES ARE
BASED ON THE BRS, DIALOG AND ORBIT SEARCH SERVICES, COVERING THE NATURE OF
ON-LINE SEARCHING, THE KINDS OF FILES AVAILABLE ON-LINE, COMMANDS USED TO
SEARCH THEM, AND SEARCH STRATEGY.
ON INFORMATION EQUIVALENCE OF DATA BASES.

USES AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF RELATIONAL DATA BASES. A
QUERY LANGUAGE BASED ON PREDICATE CALCULUS, A QUERY ALGEBRA, AN ALGEBRAIC
STRUCTURE ON THE SET OF CLASSES OF EQUIVALENT FORMULAE, AND A CORRESPONDING
RELATIONAL ALGEBRA ARE CONSTRUCTED. IN TERMS OF THESE, DEFINITIONS ARE GIVEN

INTRODUCING ONLINE DATA BASE SEARCHING IN THE SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARY: A MODEL
FOR SERVICE WITHOUT CHARGE TO UNDERGRADUATES.

THE IMPACT ON SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF SEARCHING PERIODICAL INDEXES ON-LINE
HAS NOT BEEN AS WIDESPREAD AS THAT OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, RESOURCE
SHARING, OR OCLC. BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION WAS INTEGRATED EASILY INTO NORMAL
WORK ROUTINES AND OCLC WAS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, BUT ON-LINE SEARCHING DOES
NOT APPEAR TO OFFER SUCH ADVANTAGES AND LEARNING TO OPERATE A TERMINAL CAN
SEEM TO BE ALIEN. DESCRIBES THE INTRODUCTION OF ON-LINE SEARCH FACILITIES AT
LAKE FOREST COLLEGE, A SMALL LIBERAL ARTS ESTABLISHMENT WITH A FACULTY OF 100
AND 1,000 STUDENTS. THE FACILITY WAS INITIATED WITH THE HELP OF A RESEARCH
GRANT, BUT HAS SINCE EARNED SUFFICIENT FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT TO
ENSURE ITS CONTINUATION.

GUIDING BUSINESS-VIA PRESTEL.

DISCUSSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF PROVIDING LIBRARY GUIDANCE INFORMATION TO
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY USING PRESTEL, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO 'BUSINESS
LONDON', A PROJECT BY BEXLEY LONDON BOROUGH, WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ON:
BEST SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON A TOPIC; PUBLISHED SOURCES COMMONLY AVAILABLE
IN REFERENCE LIBRARIES; THE LIBRARIES THEMSELVES; REGISTERS AND RECORDS WITH
INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE FROM PUBLISHED SOURCES; AND CONTACT POINTS FOR SOME
CATEGORIES OF UNPUBLISHED INFORMATION.
PRESTEL: WHAT'S IN IT FOR LIBRARIANS?.

PRESTEL HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN LIBRARIES AS WELL AS HOMES, IN THAT PRESTEL DOES
WHAT LIBRARIANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE-STORING, ORGANISING AND RETRIEVING
INFORMATION. WHILST PUBLIC INTEREST IN PRESTEL HAS BEEN LIMITED, THERE IS HIGH
INTEREST IN THE LIBRARY WORLD. PRESTEL OFFERS MUCH OF RELEVANCE TO THE
REFERENCE LIBRARIAN'S WORK, AND MUCH OF VALUE FOR THE LIBRARY USER. DESCRIBES
A MARKET TRIAL OF PRESTEL IN 1978 AT THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ASTON,
WHICH PROVED THE SYSTEM TO BE GENERALLY SATISFACTORY AND COST-EFFECTIVE. IT
REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER PRESTEL WILL BE FOUND USEFUL ON A NATIONWIDE SCALE
IN UK LIBRARIES GENERALLY.
PRESTEL: WILL IT LIVE UP TO PR PROMISES?.

THE 1ST PART OF A 2-PART ARTICLE (PART 2 IN THE NEXT ISSUE). DESCRIBES THE

POLICY HAS BEEN MAPPED PUT, COVERING GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES.
PROJECTS FOR THE ACADEMIC SESSION 1980-81 TO PROMOTE UNIVERSITY COURSES IN
COOPERATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE DETAILED.
DEVELOPING DATABASES FOR ONLINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

THE EMERGENCE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES REPRESENTS A SHIFT FROM PROVIDING A
PHYSICAL ENTITY, A BOOK OR AN ARTICLE, TO THE MORE ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF
PROVIDING OR TRANSFERRING INFORMATION. THE ROLE OF THE DATA BASE
DEVELOPER/ANALYST IN THAT SHIFT IS THAT OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
'CATALOGUER' RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE ACCESS POINTS SUPPORTED BY THE
DATA BASE'S CONTENTS, MUCH AS A TRADITIONAL LIBRARY CATALOGUER DEFINES,
DESCRIBES, AND CLASSIFIES THE INTELLECTUAL CONTENT OF A BOOK AND 'MAPS' IT
INTO THE LIBRARY'S CARD CATALOGUE. DESCRIBING THE TASKS REQUIRED IN DEVELOPING
A DATA BASE FOR ON-LINE SEARCHING IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER.
BROWSING IN DATA BASES.

CONSIDERS THE TASKS OF TRYING TO FIND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CAUSES OF THE
CRASHES OF SEVERAL AIRCRAFT OF A COMMON TYPE, THE CAUSES OR EARLY WARNING
SIGNS FOR VARIOUS DISEASES, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF STOCKS WITH HIGH GROWTH
POTENTIAL OR ADVANCED WARNINGS OF SEVERAL WEATHER CONDITIONS. ALL OF THESE
TASKS REQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA AND VALUABLE TIME SPENT SIFTING THROUGH
THE DATA. A BROWSING COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD ALSO PERFORM THESE TASKS. THIS
THESIS EXAMINES ONE POSSIBLE ORGANISATION FOR A BROWSING SYSTEM CONTAINING
MODELS AND HEURISTICS. THE MODELS DESCRIBE THE ORGANISATION OF THE DATA BASE
AND THE OBJECTS FROM WHICH THE DATA WAS GATHERED.
PASCAL DATA BASE FILE DESCRIPTION AND INDEXING RULES IN CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY AND
MEDICINE.

THIS REPORT ON THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY PASCAL DATA BASE DESCRIBES THE FILES AND
THE INDEXING RULES FOR CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, AND MEDICINE. PASCAL DEALS WITH ALL
ASPECTS OF CHEMISTRY WITHIN 2 SUBFILES WHOSE COMBINED YEARLY GROWTH IS ABOUT
100,000 REFERENCES. INDEXING FOR CHEMISTRY USES 2 LEXICONS OF CONTROLLED TERMS
DESCRIBING PHENOMENA, PROCESSING, PROPERTIES, METHODS, EQUIPMENT, NAMES OF
CHEMICAL REACTIONS, AND SUBSTRUCTURES OR FAMILIES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. A
SIMILAR SET OF 2 VOCABULARIES IS USED FOR BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE. THE FORM OF
THE DESCRIPTORS AND THE INDEXING IS SIMILAR TO THAT USED THROUGHOUT PASCAL IN
THAT INDEXING IS ACCOMPLISHED TO THE MOST SPECIFIC TERM WITHIN A HIERARCHICAL
STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC INDEXING RULES ARE PROVIDED IN DETAIL FOR SUBDIVISIONS
WITHIN THE 3 DISCIPLINES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

THE IDC-INORGANICA-DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM.

A METHOD IS DEVELOPED DESCRIBING THE ECONOMIC UTILISATION OF THE CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS SERVICE DATA BASES; CA CONDENSATES AND CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SUBJECT
INDEX ALERT IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT THE DATA BASE OF THE
IDC-INORGANICA-DOCUMENTATIONSYSTEM BUILT UP TO MEET THE PECULIARITIES OF
INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. THE METHOD CONSISTS OF EDP-PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES AT
WHICH SPECIAL AUTHORITY FILES FOR CODED COMPOUND AND SUBJECT ENTRIES PLAY AN
IMPORTANT ROLE. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE METHOD IS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL
EFFORT NECESSARY TO CREATE SUCH A DATA BASE IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM.
RELATING MUTAGENICITY TO CHEMICAL STRUCTURE.

A COMPUTER PROGRAM CORRELATING CHEMICAL STRUCTURE WITH MUTAGENESIS ACTIVITY
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A PREDICTIVE TEST FOR HAZARD EVALUATION. SETS OF
SUBSTRUCTURAL UNITS ARE DERIVED FROM COMPLETE STRUCTURES, AND THE PROBABILITY
THAT A STRUCTURE CONTAINING A GIVEN UNIT WILL HAVE A DESIGNATED CATEGORY OF
ACTIVITY IS CALCULATED. THE PROGRAM, VALIDATED BY BACTERIAL MUTAGENESIS
TESTING, IS CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING SIMILAR STRUCTURES, SHOWING WHY THEY ARE
SIMILAR, AND ESTIMATING THE ACTIVITY OF A STRUCTURE.
AN ASSESSMENT OF CARCINOGENICITY OF N-NITROSO COMPOUNDS BY THE SIMCA METHOD OF
PATTERN RECOGNITION.

THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE TOXIC RESPONSES OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL
POLLUTANTS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES HAS MANY
ADVANTAGES. PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT SUCH
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THE SIMCA METHOD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION IS USED TO
PREDICT THE CARCINOGENICITY OF +N-NITROSO COMPOUNDS, AND THE ADVANTAGES OF
THIS METHOD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION IN SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
DEVELOPMENT OF A FORMAT FOR ABSTRACTING DOSE-RESPONSE INFORMATION FROM
PUBLISHED STUDIES FOR USE IN QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS
(QSARS).

THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT SUBJECTS SOME 70,000 CHEMICALS TO REGULATORY
ACTION. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL TESTING OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THIS NUMBER
OF COMPOUNDS IS NOT FEASIBLE. AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
PREDICTIVE METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE POTENCY OF AN
UNTESTED COMPOUND TOWARD A SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL RECEPTOR. PREREQUISITE TO SUCH
AN ENTERPRISE IS THE HIGHLY SYSTEMATIC COMPILATION OF DOSE-RESPONSE
INFORMATION FOR A WIDE RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL END POINTS AND FOR A WIDE VARIETY
OF MOLECULAR SPECIES. A FORMAT IS DESCRIBED FOR ABSTRACTING RELEVANT
INFORMATION FROM PUBLISHED STUDIES. THE FORMAT OUTLINES THE TEST SYSTEM,
EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, RESPONSE ANALYSIS, EXPOSURE PROTOCOL, AND RESULTS AND
PRESENTS THE ORIGINAL DATA, ALL IN AN ORGANISED FORM. REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS
USED TO ESTIMATE THRES HOLDS AND POTENCIES IN THE VARIOUS TEST SYSTEMS. THE
DATA MAY THEN BE USED TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE METHODOLOGY.
EPA HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS DATA ANALYSIS SYSTEM.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM TO ORGANISE, STORE, RETRIEVE, AND
CORRELATE DATA PERTAINING TO CHEMICALS AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
EFFECTS. THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS OF DATA IDENTIFICATION, ACQUISITION,
CLASSIFICATION, AND AUTOMATION ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES AND METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. THE PROBLEMS OF COMPUTER
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE ALSO ADDRESSED, AND A DESIGN OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM
IS PRESENTED.

EVALUATION OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR ASSESSMENT OF TOXICOLOGICAL
EFFECTS OF CHEMICALS ON FISH, WILDLIFE AND ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS.

A USER-ORIENTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS NEEDED FOR ASSESSMENT OF
MATERIALS HAZARDOUS TO FISH, WILDLIFE, FOOD CHAIN ORGANISMS, AND OTHER
ORGANISMS ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS.
CRITICAL EVALUATION OF DATA ALSO REQUIRES RIGOROUS DOCUMENTATION OF TEST
CONDITIONS, PRECISION OF METHODS USED, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TEST
ORGANISM. PARTICULAR EMPHASIS OF THE EVALUATION WAS IN DEVELOPING PRACTICAL
CRITERIA THAT AID IN THE USE AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA WITH RESPECT TO NEED
FOR FURTHER TESTING IN A SCORING EXERCISE PERFORMED FOR THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES
CONTROL ACT INTERAGENCY TESTING COMMITTEE. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE
INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION ON PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, HEALTH
EFFECTS, ECOTOXICOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATION OR EXPOSURE LEVEL.
IRANIAN LIBRARY OF MEDICINE LOCAL COMPUTER NETWORK.

IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS IN IRAN, THE
IRANIAN LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (ILM) EMBARKED ON A LONG TERM PLAN WHICH ALSO
INCLUDED COMPUTERISATION OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY. IMPLEMENTATION
OF THIS PLAN STARTED BY ESTABLISHING AN ACCESS NODE TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
MEDICINE'S (NLM) MEDLINE DATA BASE, AND WAS FOLLOWED BY THE SETTING UP OF A
COMPUTER-COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK TO PROVIDE LOCAL SERVICES, TO ALLOW SEVERAL
ORGANISATIONS TO HAVE SIMULTANEOUS ACCESS TO THE NLM'S DATA BASES, AND TO
CATER FOR ACCESSING OTHER DATA BASES AVAILABLE THROUGH US-BASED INTERNATIONAL
COMPUTER NETWORKS. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE CIRCUMSTANCES GOVERNING THE DESIGN
OF THE NETWORK, REPORTS THE PROGRESS SO FAR ACHIEVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE PLAN, AND DESCRIBES MAJOR DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED. THE RESULTING INCREASE
IN THE USE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED IS ALSO NOTED BY PRESENTING GENERAL
STATISTICS OF MEDLINE USE IN THE REGI ON.

THE US SYSTEM IS UNSUITABLE, AND SPECIAL STRUCTURES WILL HAVE TO BE CREATED
FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION TO A POTENTIAL CLIENTELE OF SMALL
SCALE INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, THROUGH GOVERNMENT AID.
REFERENCE DATABASE USE: A NEW APPLICATION OF ONLINE SEARCHING.

THE USE OF ON-LINE SEARCHING BY REFERENCE LIBRARIANS TO PROVIDE ACTUAL ANSWERS
AND NOT JUST BIBLIOGRAPHIES OR CURRENT AWARENESS PRINTOUTS HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY FOR THE REFERENCE DEPARTMENT. THE QUICK REFERENCE
SERVICE CAN ACTUALLY PROMOTE RATHER THAN COMPETE WITH THE LIBRARY'S ON-LINE
SEARCH SERVICE FOR IN-DEPTH SUBJECT SEARCHING. AMONG THE MOST COMMON
APPLICATIONS OF THE QUICK REFERENCE SERVICE ARE VERIFICATION, COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT, AND ANSWERING SHORT QUESTIONS ABOUT PERSONS, ORGANISATIONS, AND
NEW FIELDS OF INTEREST. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

WHY PRODUCE CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN THE NETHERLANDS?.

MORE THAN 100 CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE BEING PUBLISHED AT THE PRESENT TIME
IN THE NETHERLANDS. IN THE PAST MANY ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE CURRENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIES HAVE FAILED FROM LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. IN THE FIELD OF
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN THE
INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPUTER ENABLING COMPLEX SEARCHES TO BE MADE RAPIDLY ON
VERY LARGE DATA BASES. MAJOR REASONS FOR PRODUCING A CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY

RESOURCES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITHOUT IMPACTING ADVERSELY ON SERVICES, SUCH
AS PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

THE ANNUAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS (25TH ISSUE 1980)
IS SURPRISINGLY LITTLE-KNOWN TO LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, CONSIDERING
THE SHORTAGE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AIDS TO PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. ITS SCOPE HAS VARIED
OVER THE YEARS; RECENTLY IT HAS COVERED INSTITUTIONS LISTED IN THE NORWEGIAN
GOVERNMENT YEARBOOK. IT COVERS CERTAIN PUBLICATIONS NOT IN THE NORWEGIAN
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. ENTRIES ARE BY INSTITUTION, WITH DEWEY NUMBERS AND
SIMPLIFIED BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS. PART I (BOOKS, ARTICLES, ANNUAL REPORTS
AND BROCHURES; ABOUT 2300 ENTRIES ANNUALLY) HAS NAME AND CLASSIFIED INDEXES,

TOWARDS A CANADIAN POLICY ON INTELLECTUAL OWNERSHIP.

EXAMINES THE QUESTION OF AUTHORS' FAIR REMUNERATION FOR USE OF THEIR WORK WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE CANADIAN SITUATION. ARGUES THAT THOSE WHO PROFIT
MOST FROM THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL WORKS ARE DATA BASE
PRODUCERS, HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ENTERPRISES, AND INFORMATION NETWORKS. THE
ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ARE EXPLORED TO ESTABLISH THE
PRINCIPLES BEHIND PROTECTING AUTHORS' INTERESTS. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE APPLIED
TO THE OPERATIONS OF THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF ACTUAL
EXPLOITATION ASSESSED BY EXAMINING THE NUMBER OF REFERENCES FREELY AVAILABLE
THROUGH THE PRINCIPLE CANADIAN INFORMATION NETWORK. CONCLUDES BY STATING THE
NECESSITY FOR A NATIONAL POLICY ENSURING THAT AUTHORS SHARE IN THE PROFITS OF

CONSISTS OF PART OF K.I. RUBINSKII'S 1909 LECTURE AT KHARKOV UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES DESERVE SERIOUS STUDY AS FACTORS IN HUMAN CULTURE. THEY ARE A
COUNTRY'S MOST VALUABLE ASSET. LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSITY
SUBJECT AS IT EVOLVES THE BEST METHODS OF DISSEMINATING KNOWLEDGE.
LIBRARIANSHIP NEEDS TO STUDY THE WORK OF PEOPLE'S AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARY HISTORY, STATISTICS, BOOK CONSERVATION, LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND STAFF
TRAINING. LIBRARIES MUST HELP ALL THOSE TURNING TO THEM AS A SCHOOL. HOWEVER,
UNTRAINED STAFF WILL HAMPER THIS. THE PEOPLE'S WAGES CREATED LIBRARIES, USE OF
THEM IS THEIR RIGHT.

THAT: (1) 'LIBRARY ACTIVITIES' AND NOT 'LIBRARY TYPES' SHOULD BE USED AS THE
BASIS FOR SCIENTIFIC TYPISATION OF LIBRARIES; (2) A NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCIENCE
DISCIPLINES HAVE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH ARE
BASED ON VARIOUS DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES; (3) THEORIES OF
SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP MUST BE BUILT ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTIVITIES
UNDERTAKEN BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND NOT ON THE 'TYPES' OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES;
(4) GENERAL LIBRARY SCIENCE REPRESENTS THE NUCLEUS ESSENTIAL FOR FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE.

EXTENDING SCHOOL LIBRARY AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES TO A SCATTERED
POPULATION' PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
     
IT WILL BE APPARENT FROM THE PROBLEMS FACING PAPUA NEW GUINEA TODAY; THE
OBSTACLES FOUND IN THE TERRAIN, THE INADEQUATE ROAD SYSTEMS, THE CULTURAL AND
LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY, THE UNEQUAL SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ITS
PEOPLE, THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONWIDE LIBRARY SERVICE, EVEN AT THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL LEVEL, AND THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE PEOPLE'S
WAY OF LIFE AND HELPFUL IN A TIME OF URGENT CHANGE, IS AN ENORMOUS TASK. TO
SPEAK OF EXTENDING SERVICES WHERE ALMOST NONE EXIST WOULD BE TO IGNORE THE
REALITIES AFFECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND OTHER MEANS OF
KEEPING PEOPLE INFORMED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF PRINT. SOME PROPOSALS FOR
INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO ENABLE THEM TO SERVE THE
COMMUNITY IN DIFFERENT WAYS ARE OFFERED.

LANGUAGE. THE MAIN LIBRARY IN GODTHAB (LATER DESIGNATED THE GREENLAND NATIONAL
LIBRARY) BEGAN TO BUILD A COLLECTION OF GREENLANDIC MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY
SERVICE'S MAIN HANDICAP IS THE ACUTE SHORTAGE OF MATERIAL IN GREENLANDIC.

CONTEXT. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, OUTLINES SOME ETHNOGRAPHICAL
TECHNIQUES-GROUNDED THEORISING (THEORETICAL SAMPLING AND THE CONSTANT
COMPARATIVE METHOD) AND TESTING THEORY (TRIANGULATION AND ANALYTIC INDUCTION).
STRESSES THAT THIS IS A RESEARCH TRADITION STILL IN THE THROES OF DEVELOPMENT.
SOURCES OF ANTAGONISM TO 'QUALITATIVE' RESEARCH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THE
STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. CONSIDERS WHY QUANTITATIVE METHODS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE MORE 'SCIENTIFIC', RIGOROUS, AND VALID THAN QUALITATIVE ONES AND ARGUES
THAT THE TERM 'QUALITATIVE' IS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RESEARCH WHICH
ARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE
QUANTITATIVE/QUALITATIVE DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL. SUGGESTS THAT CRITICISMS OF
QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ARE 'IDEOLOGICAL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY GIVE SUPPORT TO
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS WHEREIN SOME CLASSES OR GROUPS (RESEARCH SPONSORS) TRY
TO EXERT CONTROL OVER OTHERS'. TYPICAL CRITICISMS OF SUCH RESEARCH ARE
ANALYSED TO EXPOSE THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.
A CASE STUDY IN QUALITATIVE RESEARCH?.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THE
STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. REFLECTS UPON THE METHODOLOGY ADOPTED BY THE
AUTHOR IN PROJECT INISS (INFORMATION NEEDS AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN LOCAL
AUTHORITY SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS). THE CHOSEN METHOD, STRUCTURED
OBSERVATION, COMBINED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE MODES OF ANALYSIS AND
REPORTING. CONSIDERS VARIOUS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN FIELD RESEARCH OF
THIS KIND. THE AUTHOR'S AIM IS TO FIND A MEANS OF GATHERING MORE MEANINGFUL
QUANTITATIVE DATA RATHER THAN REJECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA AS SUCH.
THE TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT: AN ATTEMPT AT 'ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION'.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THE
STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. AN ACCOUNT OF THE BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH A
NON-TRADITIONAL STRATEGY OF EVALUATION WAS ADOPTED IN NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE
POLYTECHNIC'S TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT (SEE 77/3731). THE CLEAR-CUT
DISTINCTIONS ORIGINALLY ENVISAGED FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS OF
THE EVALUATION BECAME BLURRED AND THERE WAS CONFLICT BETWEEN PRESSURES FOR A
TRADITIONAL, TIGHTLY-CONTROLLED EVALUATION AND THE RESEARCHERS' PREFERENCE FOR
A MORE EXPLANATORY EVALUATION STRATEGY. ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION WAS USED; THIS
ESCHEWS PRE- AND POST-TESTING IN FAVOUR OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY OF THE
CONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS OF A VENTURE'S SUCCESS. ITS USE POSES MANY PROBLEMS
BECAUSE IT IS A BROAD STRATEGY RATHER THAN A SET OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES.
USING CASE STUDY IN LIBRARY RESEARCH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES
TO THE STUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. EXAMINES CASE-STUDY RESEARCH, ITS
DEVELOPMENT, AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS. THE AUTHOR HAS RECENTLY STARTED A
PROJECT WHICH USES MULTI-SITE CASE STUDIES TO EXAMINE 6TH-FORMERS' CAPACITY
FOR INDEPENDENT LIBRARY-BASED WORK. USES THIS AS A FRAMEWORK TO DISCUSS
QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED BY THOSE CONTEMPLATING THIS SORT OF RESEARCH.
CONSIDERS 3 MAIN SOURCES OF INFORMATION (INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS, AND
OBSERVATION); THEIR INTEGRATION INTO CASE RECORDS; AND THE USE OF NARRATION,
VIGNETTE, AND ANALYSIS AS REPORTING METHODS. POINTS OUT THAT IT IS CRUCIAL TO
FIND FORMS OF PRESENTATION CONDUCIVE TO A CRITICAL REACTION FROM THE READER.
LIBRARY RESEARCH-SCRUTINY OF AN INVESTIGATION.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE LIBRARY SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON A PROGRAMME
FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH. APPROVES THE PROGRAMME'S STRESS ON RESEARCH
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF. THE PROGRAMME IS THE 1ST ATTEMPT
AT A SURVEY AND ANALYSIS OF LIBRARY RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND RIGHTLY STRESSES
THE NEED FOR DATA ON THE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TO AND USE OF LIBRARIES BY THE
ARTS AND THE SCIENCES. BUT IT NEGLECTS AN OBVIOUS RESEARCH AREA-COOPERATION
BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY FOR EFFICIENT USE OF SCARCE RESOURCES. IN A
TIME OF ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH WHICH
MAY PROVIDE ARGUMENTS VIS-A-VIS THE GRANT GIVING AUTHORITIES FOR
'NON-QUANTIFIABLE INCOME' OR SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS. THE EMPHASIS IN THE
PROGRAMME WILL AT 1ST RIGHTLY BE ON USER STUDIES AND STUDIES AIMED AT
IMPROVING SERVICES.
CULTURAL STRUGGLE AND CIVIL COURAGE.
     
INTERVIEWS AASE BREDSDORFF, UNTIL RECENTLY INSPECTOR WITH THE DANISH LIBRARY
INSPECTORATE DEALING MAINLY WITH CHILDREN'S SERVICES. DISCUSSES HER
INVOLVEMENT WITH IFLA, WHERE SHE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY
SECTION UNTIL 1971 AND THEN MEMBER OF THE STANDING ADVISORY COMMITTEE. SHE WAS
CHAIRMAN OF THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE'S WORKING PARTY ON LIBRARY SERVICES TO
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. HER PROPOSAL IN THE REPORT ON CENTRAL LIBRARY SERVICES TO
CHILDREN, THAT CONSULTANTS FROM THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO
LOCAL CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES WAS REGRETFULLY NOT TAKEN UP. DISCUSSES STAFFING OF
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES, AND EDUCATION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS AT THE DANISH
LIBRARY SCHOOL, WHERE SHE HAS TAUGHT SINCE 1948 AND BEEN A MEMBER OF A CONTACT
COMMITTEE. COMMENTS ON THE DISCUSSION OF WHETHER SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
PLACED UNDER THE SCHOOLS ACT OR THE LIBRARY ACT. DESCRIBES HER INVOLVEMENT
WITH THE ILLEGAL MOVEMENT IN OCCUPIED DENMARK AND AFTER THE WAR THE LIBRARY
DEBATE AND TRADE UNION ACTIVITIES. COMMENTS ON THE QUALITY OF CHILDREN'S
BOOKS, THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPREHENSIVENESS IN RELATION TO ACQUISITION OF
CHILDREN'S BOOKS, AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN DEFENCE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES IN
GENERAL.
NATIONAL WORKING PARTY OF INDIAN COOPERATIVE LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTATION
OFFICERS (N.C.U.I.).
     
OUTLINES THE OBJECTIVES AND FUNCTIONS AND COMPOSITION OF THE NATIONAL WORKING
PARTY OF INDIAN COOPERATIVE LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTATION OFFICERS (OF THE
NATIONAL COOPERATIVE UNION OF INDIA) AND ITS CONSTITUENT COMMITTEES.
MAP COLLECTIONS AND LIBRARIANSHIP IN NEW ZEALAND' A SYNOPSIS.
     
OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF LAND SURVEYING AND MAPPING IN NEW ZEALAND, AND REVIEWS
BRIEFLY THE EXISTING MAP COLLECTIONS IN' GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS; RESEARCH
LIBRARIES AND UNIVERSITIES. NOTES THE CONTENT, STAFFING, STORAGE, AND
ACCOMMODATION OF THESE COLLECTIONS, AND DESCRIBES THE PRESENT FACILITIES FOR
THE TRAINING OF MAP LIBRARIANS. POINTS OUT THE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
NATIONAL MAP COLLECTION, AND A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF MAPS.
INFORMATION SCIENCE IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATIONS.
     
A LOOK AT INFORMATION RECURRENCE AND A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK ARE
BROUGHT TO BEAR ON A VERIFICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION SCIENCE. THIS
IS PROVED TO BE SCIENTIFIC AND MORE SELECTIVE IN INFORMATION SERVICE THAN
LIBRARY, TRANSLATION, OR PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES. IT DIFFERS FROM RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT BY ITS GOALS AND FUNCTIONS. ARGUES THAT INFORMATION TASKS SHOULD
BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE INFORMATION UNITS AND RESEARCH OR DESIGN DIVISIONS OF
A GIVEN ENTERPRISE OR OFFICE.
INFORMATION SCIENCE AND INFORMATION DESIGN' HAVE THEY ANYTHING TO COMMUNICATE
TO ONE ANOTHER?.
     
EXAMINES THE CONCEPT OF 'INFORMATION' AS THE TERM IN 'INFORMATION DESIGN'
STILL LARGELY TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND PROPOSES AN APPROACH FROM INFORMATION
SCIENCE WHICH CAN OFFER A USEFUL THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION DESIGN
TOO. IT ALSO LOOKS AT SOME OF THE WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT INFORMATION WHICH ARE
EMPLOYED BY PRACTITIONERS IN INFORMATION WORK, THOSE WHO DEAL WITH TEXTS FROM
THE POINT OF VIEW OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND WHO ACT AS INTERMEDIARIES
BETWEEN GENERATORS AND USERS OF INFORMATION. THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE OF THIS
GROUP OF INTERMEDIARIES IN INFORMATION COMMUNICATION HAS, IT IS ARGUED, SOME
USEFUL INSIGHTS FOR THAT OF THE OTHER GROUP-INFORMATION DESIGNERS.
THEORY AND PRACTICE IN LIBRARY EDUCATION' THE TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS.
     
STUDY OF THE PROBLEM OF THEORY AND PRACTICE IN LIBRARY EDUCATION. BASIC TO A
RESOLUTION OF PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES IN LIBRARY EDUCATION IS THE NEED TO
ARTICULATE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SELF-APPROPRIATED LEARNING, SO THAT AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THEORY, GROUNDED IN PRACTICAL TASKS, ARISES FROM THE LOGICAL
PROCESSES OF A SECURE AND RELIABLE PEDAGOGY. THE WORK IS INTENDED FOR LIBRARY
EDUCATORS, STUDENTS AND PRACTISING PROFESSIONALS.
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION' A PERSONAL VIEW.
     
DISCUSSES SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, AND
CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP EDUCATION OF SOME RECENT WORLD
TRENDS IN THE PROFESSION, INCLUDING' THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA BASES; THE
APPLICATION OF THE MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS OF COST CONTROL, COST-BENEFIT AND
EFFECTIVE MANPOWER PLANNING; THE TREND TOWARDS THE NOTION OF A GRADUATE
PROFESSION; AND THE TENDENCY FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION WORK TO COME
TOGETHER. HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR GREATER COHESION AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN
THE EDUCATORS AND THE PROFESSIONALS IN PRACTICE, AND FOR MORE ATTENTION TO
OVERALL MANPOWER PLANNING BOTH FOR THE EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PLANNING
OF SERVICES.
THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF LIBRARIANS AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL.
     
THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS HAS NOT IMPROVED IN ITALY DURING THE
LAST 50 YEARS. UNIVERSITY REFORM HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARY
ORGANISATION IN RESPECT OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING. LIBRARIANS SHOULD TAKE
DEGREE COURSES IN THE SPECIFIC DISCIPLINES OF THE CULTURAL AREAS SERVED BY THE
LIBRARIES IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO WORK. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION CANNOT BE
CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. LIBRARIANS LACKING
THE CAPACITY TO ORGANISE A LIBRARY ON TRADITIONAL LINES WILL NOT PROFIT MUCH
FROM THE ASSISTANCE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD RATIONALISE
ITS OWN LIBRARIES AND CONCENTRATE ITS INTERNAL SERVICES AT ALL LEVELS ON
SATISFYING THE REQUESTS OF ALL POTENTIAL READERS.
EDUCATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY PERSONNEL IN FINLAND.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. BRIEFLY SURVEYS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY
EDUCATION IN FINLAND, PARTICULARLY DURING THE 1970S, AND OUTLINES THE 4
1/2-YEAR COURSE LEADING TO A MASTER'S DEGREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TAMPERE
DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.
CONTINUALLY CHANGING.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE BORAS LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL, SWEDEN FOR 1979-80.
THE CHANGING FORMS OF THE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE QUESTION OF AN
EDUCATION FOR TUTOR LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED. WHEN REVIEWING THE CAPACITY OF
THE SCHOOL IT IS CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT RESPONDED WELL TO THE CHANGING LABOUR
MARKET, SOMETIMES PRODUCING OVER-, SOMETIMES UNDERCAPACITY. CRITICISES THE
PLANS FOR SEVERAL SHORTER TRAINING COURSES AS THEY MIGHT REDUCE INTEREST IN
THE 2-YEAR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSE. DISCUSSES ALSO WHETHER THE EDUCATION FOR
LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE GENERAL WITH SPECIALISATION AFTER A FOUNDATION COURSE,
AS THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES WANT, OR WHETHER SPECIALISED COURSES SHOULD BE
AVAILABLE EARLIER, AND ARGUES FOR MORE LIBRARIANS WITH SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF
ADMINISTRATION, INFORMATION WORK, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, WHICH CANNOT BE
ACQUIRED THROUGH COSTLY IN-SERVICE TRAINING.
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT-A SURVEY.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF A SAMPLE SURVEY CONDUCTED TO FIND OUT THE NATURE OF
JOBS PERFORMED BY LIBRARY PERSONNEL WITH TRAINING IN LIBRARIANSHIP, RELATING
THEM TO THE CONTENTS OF EXISTING COURSES.
THE DIPLOMA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP: A CRITICAL STUDY.
     
REPLY TO AN ARTICLE IN OPEN 12 (9) SEPT 80, 397-404 (SEE 81/1865) IN WHICH
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE DIPLOMA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE
NETHERLANDS WAS CRITICISED FOR THE LACK OF A PRACTICAL BASE. HOWEVER, STUDENTS
FOLLOWING THE COURSE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP AT THE P.A. TIELE SCHOOL OF
LIBRIANSHIP IN THE HAGUE RECEIVE LECTURES FROM PRACTISING ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS
AND THE SYLLABUS IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY IN CONSULTATION WITH STUDENTS AND WITH
STAFF FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION THE VARIETY OF POSTS IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES OPEN TO STUDENTS COMPLETING THE COURSE MAKES IT IMPRACTICAL TO SUIT
THE SYLLABUS TO A SINGLE TYPE OF LIBRARY. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT TOO LITTLE IS
KNOWN ABOUT THE COURSE BY PRACTISING LIBRARIANS.
BETTER EDUCATION IN IMMIGRANT MATTERS FOR LIBRARIANS IS WANTED.
     
TRADITIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR ESTABLISHED USER GROUPS ARE STILL THE NORM
IN SWEDISH LIBRARIES, AND IMMIGRANT SERVICES ARE CARRIED OUT AS HUMANITARIAN
AID WITH CONSEQUENT LOW STATUS. IF DEMAND FOR IMMIGRANT LITERATURE WERE
TREATED LIKE THAT FOR COOK BOOKS OR STAMP CATALOGUES A LESS EMOTIONAL ATTITUDE
WOULD BE ACHIEVED. LIBRARIES MUST HELP IMMIGRANTS TO RETAIN THEIR MOTHER
TONGUE AS WELL AS TO LEARN SWEDISH. THERE ARE GOVERNMENTAL GUIDELINES ON
STOCKING OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AND CHANNELS OF SUPPLY ARE AVAILABLE, BUT
COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING IS NEEDED. MORE CONTACT WITH
IMMIGRANT ORGANISATIONS AND BETTER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS ARE NECESSARY. WHAT
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IS LARGELY DUE TO THE WORK OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S WORKING PARTY ON IMMIGRANT AND MINORITY QUESTIONS.
THE IMAGE LIBRARY'. A ONE-DAY COURSE ORGANIZED BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
ARLIS AND HELD ON FRIDAY, 20 FEBRUARY 1981.A
     
N 'IMAGE LIBRARY' IS ANY SYSTEMATIC COLLECTION OF VISUAL IMAGES THAT EXIST FOR
ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER, AND AS SUCH, EMBRACES THE SLIDE AND PHOTOGRAPHIC
COLLECTIONS FOUND IN PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AS WELL AS COMMERICAL
PICTURE LIBRARIES, PRINT AND PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTIONS IN MUSEUMS, AND THESE
IMAGES ELEVATED TO THE STATUS OF 'ART' AND STORED IN ART GALLERIES. SUMMARISES
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE ONE-DAY COURSE, WHICH WERE' AN INTRODUCTION TO THE
IMAGE LIBRARY, BY ANTHONY BURTON; IMAGE LIBRARIES AND MODERN LIBRARIANSHIP, BY
DAVID LEE; A PAPER, ALSO BY DAVID LEE, ON THE BBC HULTON PICTURE LIBRARY'S
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME; A TALK ON THE V&A DEPARTMENT OF PRINTS AND DRAWINGS, BY
MICHAEL SNODIN; AND A PAPER ON RECENT WORK ON THE COMPARISON OF THE USEFULNESS
OF AACR2 AND MDA WHEN CATALOGUING VISUAL MATERIAL ACQUIRED FOR ITS DOCUMENTARY
VALUE, BY WENDY SHERIDAN.
TEACHING THE THEORIES OF MANAGEMENT IN AN AFRICAN LIBRARY SCHOOL.
     
DESCRIBES THE AUTHOR'S REACTIONS TO HIS ATTEMPTS TO TEACH THE SUBJECT OF
ALLEGED OBSTACLES TO SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT IN AN AFRICAN LIBRARY SCHOOL.
SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS APPROPRIATE TO THE LOCAL SCENE WERE OF
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE STUDIES. EARLY SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT THEORY
INSISTED ON THE NEED FOR A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF ALL INSTITUTIONS, AND
ANYTHING WHICH LEADS TO THE SAME KIND OF STUDIES IN AFRICAN SOCIETIES SHOULD
BE ENCOURAGED.
PROCESS AUTOMATION IN DEVELOPING TRAINING CURRICULA.
     
SHOWS THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR COMPILING SUBJECT
CONTENT AND PLANNING CURRICULA FOR INFORMATION OFFICER TRAINING PROGRAMMES;
CONSIDERS IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM;
AND IDENTIFIES THE SYSTEM BASES AS A SUBJECT PLANNING STRUCTURE, A LIST OF
REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH INFORMATION OFFICER GROUP, AND A SET OF RETRIEVAL
PROCEDURES.
ON PROBLEM AREAS IN TRAINING SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD OF PATENT INFORMATION IN
THE USSR.
     
DESCRIBES THE SOVIET PATENT INFORMATION SPECIALIST TRAINING SYSTEM. ITS
PARTICULAR ORGANISATIONAL FORMAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF
THE PATENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR NATIONAL ECONOMY SPECIALISTS; THESE FEATURES
STEM FROM THE PLANNED NATURE OF THE SOCIALIST ECONOMY AND ITS INFLUENCE
THROUGHOUT INDUSTRY. STRESSES THE KEY ROLE OF THE USSR STATE COMMITTEE FOR
INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES, WHICH SUPERVISES THE PATENT SPECIALIST TRAINING
AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING ESTABLISHMENTS; OUTLINES A TYPICAL CURRICULUM; AND
POINTS OUT THE NECESSITY OF TEACHING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF PATENT SCIENCE
TO THOSE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT.
PERFECTING THE COURSE CONTENT IN THE INSTITUTE FOR THE ADVANCED TRAINING OF
INFORMATION WORKERS.
     
PRESENTS THE NEW CURRICULA OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE ADVANCED TRAINING OF
INFORMATION WORKERS, MOSCOW. THEIR DESIGN INCORPORATES A MODULAR APPROACH,
SPECIALISED TRAINING, AND THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE CORRELATION BETWEEN COURSE
CONTENT AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS.
TRAINING NEEDS IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES' SURVEY REPORT.
     
IN SUMMER 78, CANADA'S COUNCIL OF FEDERAL LIBRARIES COMMITTEE ON CONTINUING
EDUCATION SURVEYED THE TRAINING NEEDS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES. THE
RESULTS INDICATED THAT FEDERAL LIBRARIES IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE IN
NEED OF CONTINUING EDUCATION OR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES. PRESENTS
THESE RESULTS AND DISCUSSES OPTIONS FOR TRAINING PROGRAMMES.
SPECIALISATION OF TECHNICAL TRANSLATORS IN DISCIPLINARY INFORMATION CENTRES.
     
DISCUSSES THE TRAINING OF TRANSLATORS OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE
FOR INFORMATION CENTRES AND MAKES A CASE FOR SOVIET FACTORIES AND OFFICES TO
ESTABLISH A SCIENTIFICALLY-GROUNDED TRANSLATOR TRAINING SYSTEM WITHIN THE
EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF SPECIALISED TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION IMPROVEMENT. THE
3 LEVELS OF THE TRANSLATOR TRAINING SYSTEM ARE DESCRIBED.
USE OR VALUE OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES STATEMENTS.
     
MAN ABSTRACTS EXPERIENCE INTO SYMBOLS AND USES THEM TO REDIRECT HIS ENERGIES
IN MANIPULATING THE REAL WORLD. THE ORGANISATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS THUS
ABSTRACTED CHANGE SO RAPIDLY THAT MAN HAS DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING THEM.
ABSTRACTIONS OF ORGANISATIONS (SUCH AS LIBRARIES) SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS
HAVING A REALITY. STATEMENTS MADE ON THE PURPOSE AND GOALS OF ORGANISATIONS
ARE AT BEST LIKE HYPOTHESES WHICH ARE TEMPORARY DESCRIPTIONS OF AN ENVIRONMENT
THAT MUST BE TESTABLE TO BE OF VALUE. THE MARK OF A HEALTHY ORGANISATION RESTS
ON THE FERVOUR WITH WHICH IT TESTS GOALS.
THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED BY THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA MINISTER FOR STATE ON THE OCCASION OF
THE OPENING OF THE EXTENSION TO ADCOL LIBRARY, 15 OCT 80. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION
OF THE LIBRARY IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR AND TO EDUCATE ITS
USERS-LIBRARIES ARE THEREFORE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND CENTRES OF LEARNING
AND EDUCATION, AND THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF A LIBRARY TO PROVIDE THESE
SERVICES DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE QUALITY OF THE LIBRARIANS WHO RUN IT.
LIBRARIES ARE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA.
     
BAVARIA HAS A POPULATION OF 10.8 MILLION OF WHOM ONLY 25% LIVE IN THE 6 MAIN
CITIES. THERE IS A STRONG TRADITION OF BOOK PUBLISHING, WITH OVER 200
PUBLISHERS IN MUNICH ALONE. THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY IS THE LARGEST LIBRARY
IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC WITH A STOCK OF 4 MILLION VOLUMES. THERE ARE ALSO 10
UNIVERSITY AND 11 REGIONAL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. 745 INDEPENDENT MUNICIPAL
LIBRARIES HAD 971,000 REGISTERED READERS IN 1979 AND ISSUES WERE 21.6 MILLION.
THERE IS CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WITH BRANCHES
FREQUENTLY LOCATED IN SCHOOLS. THE CHURCHES MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION-THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH PROVIDES 1,273 SERVICE POINTS AND THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH 179.

JEWETT'S ROLE IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY FOR THE USA.
     
IN 1835, THE USA RECEIVED A BEQUEST UNDER THE WILL OF JAMES SMITHSON (A UK
CHEMIST) FOR FOUNDING IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AN ESTABLISHMENT 'FOR THE INCREASE
AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE AMONG MEN'. FOLLOWS THE DISCUSSIONS IN CONGRESS
LEADING TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION ORGANISING ACT IN
1844, ITS SIGNING IN 1846, AND THE WORK OF THE SMITHSONIAN BOARD OF REGENTS
WHICH PLANNED THE COLLECTION. FOCUSES ON CHARLES COFFIN JEWETT'S ROLE IN
ESTABLISHING THE COLLECTION; HIS DESIRE TO MAKE IT A FOCAL POINT FOR US
RESEARCH; HIS CAMPAIGN FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY; AND HIS DREAM OF A NATIONAL
UNION CATALOGUE. REPRODUCES HIS 1ST ANNUAL REPORT TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS,
1848 (HE WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY), IN WHICH HE PRESENTS AND EXPLAINS HIS
BELIEFS AND DESIRES.
SECTION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LIBRARIES (IFLA).
     
THE OBJECTIVES OF THE IFLA SECTION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LIBRARIES ARE COVERED.
ALSO LISTED ARE RESEARCH PROJECTS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE
ACTIVITIES OF THE SECTION.
THE PEACE PALACE LIBRARY IN THE HAGUE.
     
FOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE 1ST HAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE IN 1899, THE PEACE
PALACE LIBRARY PRIMARILY SERVES THE ORGANISATIONS IN THE PEACE PALACE
(INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS, PERMANENT COURT OF
ARBITRATION, AND THE HAGUE ACADEMY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW), BUT IS ALSO
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. IT SPECIALISES IN INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
LAW, RECEIVES 3,300 PERIODICALS AND SERIALS, AND ADDS 3,000 WORKS TO ITS
COLLECTION ANNUALLY. IT IS A DEPOSITORY FOR MANY INTERGOVERNMENTAL
ORGANISATIONS AND ITS COLLECTION WOULD OCCUPY 20 KILOMETRES IF STACKED
LINEARLY. DESCRIBES ITS VARIOUS COLLECTIONS, ACQUISITION POLICIES AND METHODS,
AND PROCESSING TECHNIQUES.
SECTION OF BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES LIBRARIES.
     
ONE OF IFLA'S NEWEST SECTIONS, THE SECTION OF BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
LIBRARIES, WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1977. PROJECTS IN PROGRESS ARE MENTIONED.
PROFILES OF TWELVE MUSIC LIBRARIES AT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS OFFERING GRADUATE
DEGREES IN MUSIC (A WORKING DRAFT).
     
AN ANALYSIS OF 12 MUSIC LIBRARIES PRESENTS DOCUMENTATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF GUIDELINES FOR MUSIC COLLECTIONS AT INSTITUTIONS OFFERING GRADUATE MUSIC
PROGRAMMES. THE PROFILES EXAMINE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND ORGANISATION,
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANISATION, AND SERVICES AT THE SELECTED
INSTITUTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SECTION OF GEOGRAPHY AND MAP LIBRARIES.
     
THE HISTORY OF THE IFLA SECTION OF GEOGRAPHY AND MAP LIBRARIES AND ITS
PROJECTS FROM 1968 ARE TRACED. ON-GOING PROJECTS, INCLUDING PROJECTS
UNDERTAKEN IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, ARE COVERED.
COLUMBUS MEMORIAL LIBRARY-BIBLIOTECA CONMEMORATIVA DE COLON-OF THE PAN
AMERICAN UNION, WASHINGTON.
     
THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF AMERICAN STATES, HELD IN WASHINGTON IN
1889-90 MADE PROVISIONS FOR THE CREATION OF A LATIN AMERICAN LIBRARY TO BE
ESTABLISHED IN WASHINGTON. THE LIBRARY, KNOWN AS THE COLUMBUS MEMORIAL LIBRARY
(BIBLIOTECA CONMEMORATIVA DE COLON) WAS FORMED BY CONTRIBUTIONS OF PRINTED
MATERIAL FROM ALL THE MEMBER STATES AND IS ONE OF THE MOST OUTSTANDING
LIBRARIES IN THE US OF BOOKS RELATING TO THE IBEROAMERICAN COUNTRIES,
SPECIALISING IN HISTORICAL, GEOGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY WORKS, MAPS, MANUSCRIPTS
AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. WHILE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE COLUMBUS MEMORIAL
LIBRARY IS TO SERVE THE PAN AMERICAN UNION AND ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES
BY PREPARING MATERIAL IN ORDER TO HELP SOLVE THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL PROBLEMS, THE COLUMBUS MEMORIAL LIBRARY ALSO HAS BECOME A CENTRE FOR
RESEARCH AND INFORMATION, BESIDES ATTENDING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. FURTHER
MORE, IT KEEPS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE LIBRARIES OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH
AMERICA.
INFORMATION SERVICES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LIBRARIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
ATTEMPTS TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION SERVICES BEING OFFERED BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE LIBRARIES (ATTACHED TO THE DEPARTMENTS/MINISTRIES OF THE
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS) IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. EXCLUDED FROM
THE PURVIEW OF THE ASSESSMENT ARE UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES. IT IS
HOPED THAT THE APPRAISAL WILL LEAD TO FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS, AND THAT A
PROGRAMME MAY BE DRAWN UP FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LIBRARIES
IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES AS MEANS OF MAKING LIBRARY SERVICES MORE EFFECTIVE.
     
THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS OF DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES IN THE USSR, HUNGARY AND EAST
GERMANY ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED. IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
DECLARATION NO. 237 FROM 1977 AND THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT DECLARATION NO. 417
FROM THE SAME YEAR ARE CONCERNED WITH THE BUILDING OF DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.
THE NATIONAL COORDINATION CENTRE WORKED OUT IN 1979 A PROPOSAL FOR THE CENTRAL
DEPOSITORY LIBRARY IN BRATISLAVA. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT THE LIBRARY WILL BE
BUILT IN ZABI MAJER NEAR RACA, CLOSE TO BRATISLAVA CITY. THE ACTUAL BUILDING
IS EXPECTED TO BE READY BY 1987; UP TO THIS TIME THE CENTRAL DEPOSITORY
LIBRARY WILL FUNCTION IN TEMPORARY PREMISES.
PUBLIC LIBRARY RESEARCH.
     
INTERVIEW WITH N. MOORE, PROJECT OFFICER IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY RESEARCH
AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY. DEFINES RESEARCH AS THEORETICAL RESEARCH, WHICH
PROVIDES GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR USERS, AND
RESEARCH WHICH SEEKS TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND HELP LIBRARIANS PROVIDE
BETTER SERVICES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE LATTER. RECENT
RESEARCH HAS BEGUN TO LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE RESULTS
ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE SERVICES. THE BRITISH LIBRARY SUPPORTS RESEARCH
INVESTIGATING RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION, COOPERATION AND STAFF ORGANISATION IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO
FURTHER EDUCATION. THIS RESEARCH IS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CARRIED OUT BY
PRACTISING LIBRARIANS, OFTEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY SCHOOLS. THE
BRITISH LIBRARY ALSO FINANCES RESEARCH CENTRES, WHICH INITIATE RESEARCH, BUILD
UP COLLECTIONS OF RESOURCE MATERIAL AND ADVISE RESEARCHERS. AN ADVISORY COMM
ITTEE ON PUBLIC LIBRARY RESEARCH HELPS THE BRITISH LIBRARY COORDINATE RESEARCH.

A LICK AND A PROMISE?: FRANS STEIN'S INTERVIEW WITH FRANS VAN DE ROER ON THE
FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FRANS STEIN IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN
SAMENLEVING 8 (11) NOV 80, 311-316 (SEE 81/3084), BY FRANS VAN DE ROER, HEAD
OF THE LIBRARY SECTION AT THE DUTCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE, RECREATION AND SOCIAL
SERVICES REPRESENT A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS. IN SPITE OF GOVERNMENT ASSURANCES THAT ACCESS TO INFORMATION
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL SECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC, VAN DE ROER IS CLEARLY IN
FAVOUR OF INCREASING MEMBERSHIP CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN AN EFFORT TO
REDUCE GOVERNMENT SPENDING. LIBRARIANS MUST CONVINCE THE AUTHORITIES THAT
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES SHOULD BE REGARDED AS PART OF A NATIONAL INFORMATION
POLICY AND NOT AS PART OF THE LOCAL SOCIO-CULTURAL SERVICES.
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE RURAL AREAS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.
     
EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE DENSELY POPULATED RURAL
AREAS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA. THE LOW, AS WELL AS THE POOR QUALITY OF BOOK
PRODUCTION, THE HIGH ILLITERACY RATE, THE LIBRARY'S ENTRY INTO COMMUNITY
INFORMATION SERVICES AND THE CONCEPT OF THE JOINT-USE SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES ARE DISCUSSED. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOBILE LIBRARY EXPERIMENTS IN
THE UK, AS WELL AS THE IMAGINATIVE USE OF MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES IN
SCANDINAVIA MAY OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS.
LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN NEW PROVIDENCE (BAHAMAS).
     
LOOKS BRIEFLY AT LIBRARY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UK DURING THE 18TH AND EARLY 19TH
CENTURIES AND DESCRIBES THE INFLUENCE OF EARLY UK LIBRARY MOVEMENTS ON LIBRARY
SERVICE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BAHAMAS. NEWSPAPERS OF 1804 AND 1835 MENTION
CIRCULATING LIBRARIES IN NASSAU AND NASSAU PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED IN
1837. OTHER TOWNS FOUNDED PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE 1850S-60S. QUOTING FROM
CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE, DESCRIBES THE SIZE AND CHARACTER OF NASSAU'S LIBRARY
COLLECTION AND NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS IN THE 1850S AND OUTLINES THE LIBRARY'S
DEVELOPMENT UP TO THE PRESENT. BRIEFLY MENTIONS OTHER PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
BAHAMAS.
DISTRICT LIBRARIES IN HIMACHAL PRADESH' A SURVEY.
     
DESCRIBES THE ROLE OF THE DISTRICT LIBRARY AND INDICATES THE HISTORICAL
DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRICT LIBRARIES IN HIMACHAL PRADESH. GIVES AN ASSESSMENT OF
RESOURCES OF VARIOUS DISTRICT LIBRARIES AND REVIEWS THE PROBLEMS OF THESE
LIBRARIES. INCLUDES THE STATISTICS REGARDING STAFF, HOLDINGS, SERVICES, ETC.,
AND MENTIONS THE VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THESE LIBRARIES.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN AN INDUSTRIAL TOWN AND PORT KOTKA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. KOTKA MUNICIPAL LIBRARY'S NEW BUILDING WAS
OPENED IN 1977. THE BUILDING HAS AN AREA OF 6,000 SQ.M., OF WHICH 5,000 BELONG
TO THE LIBRARY AND 1,000 TO THE REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF MUSIC. IT MAINLY SERVES
THE 15,000 INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN CENTRE, BUT IS ALSO THE CENTRE OF LIBRARY
OPERATIONS IN THE AREA (WHICH HAS 62,000 INHABITANTS). IT CONTAINS 107,000
BOOKS; 316,000 LOANS WERE MADE IN 1979. APPROXIMATELY 1,300 PEOPLE VISITED THE
LIBRARY EACH DAY IN 1979, 300 OF WHOM CAME FOR A NON-BORROWING PURPOSE.
INCLUDES PLANS OF THE LIBRARY.
FIFTY YEARS OF MOBILE LIBRARIES IN MANCHESTER, 1931-1981.
     
THE POPULATION OF MANCHESTER EXPANDED RAPIDLY IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR
I AND THERE WAS A DEMAND FOR MORE BRANCH LIBRARIES. THE NECESSARY MONEY WAS
NOT AVAILABLE, SO THE CITY LIBRARIAN SUGGESTED A TRAVELLING LIBRARY ON THE
LINES OF THOSE ALREADY IN USE IN THE USA AND THE UK'S 1ST MOBILE LIBRARY TOOK
TO THE STREETS OF MANCHESTER IN JULY 1931. THE SERVICE WAS WELL-USED AND
EXPANDED, WAS SUSPENDED DURING WORLD WAR II, AND WAS RESUMED IN 1948. IT IS
NOW AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CITY'S LIBRARY SERVICE, SERVING AREAS UNABLE TO
SUPPORT A BRANCH LIBRARY, THOSE UNABLE TO VISIT A BRANCH LIBRARY, AND AREAS
WHERE CUTS IN EXPENDITURE HAVE FORCED BRANCH LIBRARY CLOSURES.
USER SERVICES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF JORDAN LIBRARY (IN ARABIC).
     
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY LIBRARY IS MEASURED MAINLY BY ITS COLLECTIONS AND THE
SERVICES IT OFFERS TO ITS CLIENTELE. DESCRIBES THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THE
UNIVERSITY OF JORDAN LIBRARY, INCLUDING BORROWING, REFERENCE, PERIODICALS AND
PHOTOCOPYING SERVICES; READING FACILITIES; USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES;
PUBLICITY AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES; AND EXTRA SERVICES SUCH AS

IN THE PREFACE TO THE REPORT, NORMAN D. STEVENS EXPLAINS THAT THE UNIVERSITY
OF CONNECTICUT LIBRARY EXPERIENCED A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME IN 1979-80.
THE RESULTANT REDUCTION IN LIBRARY HOURS GENERATED MUCH ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND
IT WAS FEARED THAT FUTURE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS WOULD BE INADEQUATE. THE LIBRARY
ADVISORY COMMITTEE WERE ENCOURAGED TO PLAY A MORE VISIBLE ROLE IN BRINGING THE
LIBRARY'S PROBLEMS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION. THE
LIBRARIAN PREPARED A REPORT AS AN INTRODUCTION TO AN ORAL PRESENTATION BY THE
COMMITTEE TO THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT. PRESENTS THE TEXT OF THE REPORT, WHICH
STRESSES THE VITAL CENTRAL ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN A STRONG UNIVERSITY.
THE TULANE LAW LIBRARY IN NEW ORLEANS' A WINDOW ON THE WORLD.
     
THE LAW LIBRARY AT TULANE UNIVERSITY (NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA) REFLECTS THE
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVIL LAW (THE CONTINENTAL EUROPE SYSTEM, AS
LOUISIANA WAS A COLONY OF FRANCE AND SPAIN BEFORE ITS PURCHASE BY THE USA IN
1803) AND COMMON LAW (ANGLO-AMERICAN) SYSTEMS. IT HAS A COLLECTION OF OVER
200,000 VOLUMES. ALTHOUGH THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOOK SELECTION AND
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT RESTS WITH THE HEAD LAW LIBRARIAN, ALL LIBRARIANS,
FACULTY, AND STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS. A SPECIAL COURSE IN
LEGAL RESEARCH AND WRITING IS GIVEN BY THE LAW LIBRARIAN AS A REQUIRED COURSE
FOR ALL FRESHMEN J.D. STUDENTS AND INTRODUCTORY LECTURES IN LEGAL RESEARCH ARE
GIVEN TO THE GRADUATE STUDENTS.
A SECTION WITHOUT A PAST' ON THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SECTION FOR SPECIAL
LIBRARIES OF THE DUTCH ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS, DOCUMENTALISTS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.
     
THE FORMATION OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARIES SECTION OF THE NEDERLANDSE VERENIGING
VAN BIBLIOTHECARISSEN, DOCUMENTALISTEN EN LITERATUURONDERZOEKERS (DUTCH
ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS, DOCUMENTALISTS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS) IN THE
NETHERLANDS IN 1941 WAS DUE LARGELY TO THE EFFORTS OF DR. L.J. VAN DER WOLK,
LIBRARIAN OF THE NITROGEN PRODUCTS DIVISION OF THE STATE MINES IN LIMBURG. AT
VAN DER WOLK'S SUGGESTION, MEMBERSHIP OF THE SECTION WAS ORIGINALLY RESTRICTED
TO STAFF OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES. THE FIRST COMMITTEE MEETING
OF THE SECTION WAS HELD IN THE STATE MINES CENTRAL LABORATORY AT GELEEN ON 17
SEPT 41 AND THE 1ST MEETING OF MEMBERS ON 29 OCT FOLLOWING IN THE PARK HOTEL,
AMSTERDAM. MEMBERSHIP OF THE SECTION HAS GROWN FROM 204 IN 1948 TO 760 IN
1980.
THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN SOVIET CONSUMER COOPERATIVES' ACTIVITY.
     
THE USSR HAS OVER 7,000 CONSUMER COOPERATIVES WITH A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF
NEARLY 60 MILLION. THE MAIN COOPERATIVE LIBRARY IS THE CENTROSOYUS CENTRAL
LIBRARY IN MOSCOW. ITS 60,000-VOLUME COLLECTION CONTAINS RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN
BOOKS, PERIODICALS, STANDARDS AND CATALOGUES ON SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TOPICS,
MANAGEMENT, ORGANISATION OF LABOUR, AND ALL ASPECTS OF COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES.
IT RUNS THE CENTRAL INFORMATION FUND FOR COOPERATIVES AND IS THE
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR ALL COOPERATIVE LIBRARIES.

LIBRARIES.
     
GIVES BRIEF DETAILS OF THE COLLECTIONS HELD, AND SERVICES OFFERED BY 8 MOSQUE
LIBRARIES IN TEHRAN, CAPITAL OF IRAN. COMPARES THESE LIBRARIES WITH US
CHRISTIAN CHURCH LIBRARIES, NOTING A NUMBER OF SIMILARITIES AND CONTRASTS.
AFRICAN MATERIALS AND THE BIBLE SOCIETY.
     
THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN BIBLE SOCIETY WAS FOUNDED IN 1804. ONE OF ITS 1ST ACTS
WAS TO ESTABLISH A LIBRARY. IT LAUNCHED A PUBLIC APPEAL FOR COPIES OF ALL
EDITIONS OF THE SCRIPTURES AND RESOLVED TO DEPOSIT IN THE LIBRARY 6 COPIES OF
EVERY SOCIETY PUBLICATION. THE LIBRARY NOW CONTAINS 28,000 VOLUMES IN NEARLY
2,000 LANGUAGES (INCLUDING 500 AFRICAN LANGUAGES). IT HAS A SPECIAL INTEREST
IN EUROPE AND AFRICA (ITS SISTER LIBRARY IN NEW YORK CONCENTRATES ON THE
AMERICAS AND ASIA-PACIFIC). OUTLINES THE LIBRARY'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, ITS
BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK, AND ITS ARCHIVAL AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.
REPORT TO THE WISCONSIN VETERANS HOME (KING WISCONSIN). STUDY OF RESIDENT'S
READING AND MEDIA INTERESTS AS A BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPING PROGRAM OF LIBRARY
SERVICE.
     
THIS STUDY' (1) IDENTIFIES THE LIBRARY-RELATED NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THE
RESIDENTS OF THE WISCONSIN VETERANS HOME (WVH), (2) SEARCHES FOR CLUES ON
ACTIVATING A PROGRAMME OF LIBRARY SERVICE, AND (3) EXPLORES THE FEASIBILITY OF
ESTABLISHING THE WVH AS A COMMUNITY LIBRARY FOR KING, WISCONSIN. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION IN SMALLER HOSPITALS IN THE NETHERLANDS.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN HOSPITALS WITH LESS
THAN 100 BEDS IS SERIOUSLY INADEQUATE. A SURVEY OF SMALLER HOSPITALS IN THE US
IN 1975 SHOWED THAT 1/3 OF HOSPITALS SURVEYED HAD SOME FORM OF LIBRARY. THE
PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN DUTCH HOSPITALS IS HINDERED BY INADEQUATE
BOOKFUNDS, STAFF AND ACCOMMODATION. FURTHERMORE, IN THE SMALLER HOSPITALS
DOCTORS ARE TOO BUSY WITH ROUTINE WORK TO USE LIBRARY SERVICES. SMALLER
HOSPITALS COULD PROVIDE MEDICAL 'CORE' LIBRARIES OF BASIC TEXTBOOKS AND
PERIODICALS AT MINIMAL COST. SUCH A MEDICAL CORE LIBRARY WAS FORMED IN 1973 AT
THE PRINCESS IRENE HOSPITAL IN ALMELO AND BY 1979 THE LIBRARY CONTAINED 266
BOOKS AND 6 PERIODICAL TITLES.
LIBRARIES IN PRISON DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF READING MATERIAL PROVISION FOR UK PRISONERS OVER
THE LAST 200 YEARS. DURING THE LAST 10 YEARS, PRISON LIBRARIES HAVE COME UNDER
INCREASING SCRUTINY AND ASSESSMENT AND A LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY IS
PREPARING GUIDELINES. PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE CHARACTERISED BY VARIATIONS
AMONG ESTABLISHMENTS. THE LIBRARIES ARE RUN BY THE HOME OFFICE PRISON
DEPARTMENT AND ARE TREATED AS A COMPONENT OF GENERAL EDUCATION PROVISION. THEY
ARE FINANCED BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS, RECEIVING A PER CAPITA RATE
DETERMINED FROM A FORMULA AGREED BETWEEN THE PRISON DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITY ASSOCIATIONS. SPECIAL FACILITIES OPERATED BY LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES
ARE AVAILABLE IN ALL PRISONS. ON 31 MAR 81, 70.5% OF PRISONERS HAD AN AVERAGE
OF 4 BOOKS EACH ON LOAN.

ABSTRACTS, SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS.
LIBRARIES AND THE UNITED NATION'S INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED IN A
PRESENT AND FUTURE LIBRARY CONTEXT. LIBRARIES MUST ASSIST HANDICAPPED PEOPLE
TO TAKE PART IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY ON EQUAL TERMS
WITH EVERYONE ELSE, BUT THIS MEANS THAT THEY MUST HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE
INFORMATION AND EXPRESSIVE HUMAN EXPERIENCE CAUGHT BY THE PRINTED WORD. A
TOTAL OR PARTIAL READING HANDICAP WILL HINDER THIS ACCESS. TO THE LIBRARY
FALLS THE TASK OF BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS WHICH PREVENT THOSE WITH A
READING HANDICAP FROM GAINING ACCESS TO THE MESSAGE CONTAINED BY WORDS IN
PRINT.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED IN FINLAND.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. THE ORGANISATION OF HOSPITAL AND NURSING HOME
LIBRARIES IN FINLAND IS BASED ON THE 1961 LIBRARY ACT, THE RELEVANT PASSAGES
OF WHICH ARE PROBABLY DERIVED FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THOSE MUNICIPALITIES
WHICH HAVE PROVIDED SUCH SERVICES SINCE THE 1940S. THE LIBRARIES ARE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND RECEIVE HIGHER GOVERNMENT
GRANTS THAN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. THE INSTITUTION AND PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATE
CLOSELY IN THE LIBRARY'S DAY-TO-DAY RUNNING. OUTLINES THE ACTIVITIES IN SUCH
LIBRARIES, DEFICIENCIES, STAFF TRAINING, AND LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
NON-HOSPITALISED HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE WHOLE SUBJECT IS BEING INVESTIGATED
BY 2 WORKING GROUPS.
LIBRARY PROVISION FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN FINLAND.

CHILDREN, YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DESCRIBES A PROJECT WHICH BEGAN IN MAY 79 AT TROMS COUNTY LIBRARY, NORWAY, ON
THE USE OF BOOKS AND LIBRARY TOGETHER WITH MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN, YOUNG
PEOPLE AND ADULTS. THE WORK WENT ON UNTIL JUNE 80, AND A REPORT HAS SINCE BEEN
PRINTED ON THE WORK DONE AND EXPERIENCE GAINED. MOST OF THE WORK ON THE
PROJECT WAS CARRIED OUT AT TROMSO, AND THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF IT IN
COOPERATION WITH INSTITUTIONS, SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES IN THE TOWN. INFORMATION
ABOUT EXPERIENCE GAINED ELSEWHERE IN NORWAY WAS OBTAINED AND USED AS
BACKGROUND MATERIAL AND AS MATERIAL FOR CORRECTION AND SUPPORT AS THE WORK
PROGRESSED.
THE LIBRARY, THE BOOKS AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
VANGEDEHUSE IS A DANISH COUNTY INSTITUTION, WHICH ACCOMMODATES ABOUT 300
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS, ALL OF WHOM ARE WHAT IS KNOWN AS MENTALLY
RETARDED. MANY ALSO SUFFER FROM OTHER EXTENSIVE HANDICAPS, INCLUDING
BLINDNESS, DEAFNESS, PSYCHOSES AND SPASTIC PARALYSIS. DESCRIBES THE FUN AND
THE PLEASURE WHICH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE GET OUT OF THE LIBRARY DESPITE THEIR
MANY AND TERRIBLE HANDICAPS.
SERVICE TO OLDER ADULT USERS OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A STUDY OF LIBRARIAN
ATTITUDES.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH.) A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 311
LIBRARIANS AT US COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SPONSORING ELDERHOSTEL (A PROGRAMME
FOR ADULTS AGED OVER 60, OFFERED ON MANY CAMPUSES) FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS DURING
1977-79. THE 197 REPLIES CONTAINING USABLE DATA INDICATED THAT THE LIBRARIANS
DISAGREED WITH STEREOTYPIC STATEMENTS CONCERNING OLDER ADULTS; CONTACT WITH
OLDER ADULT RELATIVES WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE LIBRARIANS'
RESPONSES TO THE STATEMENTS; IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR OLDER ADULTS
WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN LIBRARIANS' AGREEMENT WITH SUGGESTED LIBRARY
SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS, WHILE PLANNING PROGRAMMES FOR THEM WAS LESS
SIGNIFICANT AND VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY WORK WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR; AND
LIBRARIANS FELT THAT AGE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DEBILITATIVE FACTOR WITH REGARD
TO LEARNING AND MOTIVATION TO LEARN.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE ASEAN REGION.
     
THE PRESENT SITUATION IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE ASEAN (ASSOCIATION OF
SOUTH-EAST ASIAN NATIONS) REGION, COVERING INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, PHILIPPINES,
SINGAPORE AND THAILAND, IS DESCRIBED. THE REPORT IS BASED ON A QUESTIONNAIRE
SENT FROM THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SECTION OF IFLA TO
INDIVIDUAL RESPONDENTS IN THE AREA. INFORMATION IS VIEWED AGAINST THE GENERAL
CULTURAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND OF THE REGION AS A WHOLE.
THE REPORT COVERS ALL ASPECTS OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY WORK BUT FOCUS IS ON BOOK
PROVISION (LANGUAGE, PRODUCTION) AND LIBRARY FACILITIES AND SERVICES. BRIEFLY
COVERED IS THE ROLE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND THE POSITION OF CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIANS.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE CHILD USER.
     
ARGUES THAT, DESPITE THE INCREASING EVIDENCE OF A MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE ON
THE PART OF LIBRARIES TO THE USE OF THEIR FACILITIES BY CHILDREN DURING THE
PAST 2 DECADES, THERE IS STILL A PERCEPTION ON THE PART OF SOME CHILDREN AND
THEIR PARENTS THAT LIBRARIES ARE SOMEHOW INIMICAL TO THEIR WAY OF LIFE.
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LIBRARY SERVICES TO DEVELOP IN WAYS APPROPRIATE TO THE
MEETING OF THE NEEDS OF THE 20TH CENTURY CHILD, AND CONSIDERS THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE CHILD FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
CHILDREN.
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
FINAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS FOR CHILDREN'S PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE APPOINTED BY THE CHILDREN'S COMMITTEE OF THE ONTARIO PUBLIC
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, A DIVISION OF THE ONTARIO LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (NOW THE
CHILDREN'S SERVICES GUILD). IT WAS TO BE PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL
MEETING OF THE GUILD, 31 OCT 80. COVERS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, ADMINISTRATION,
STAFFING, RESEARCH, ADVISORY SERVICES, OTHER SERVICES, AND MATERIALS.
FUNCTIONS AND AIMS OF ITALIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
BOOKS BY THEMSELVES DO NOT CREATE A SCHOOL LIBRARY. IT SHOULD CONSTITUTE AN
INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSES, INTERACTING
WITH THE PUPIL. CLASSIFIED CATALOGUES COMBINED WITH OPEN ACCESS HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ROLE. THE SCHEME WILL USUALLY BE DEWEY DECIMAL OR OCCASIONALLY
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS BUT THE FLEXIBLE COLON CLASSIFICATION ALSO MERITS
CONSIDERATION.
A SURVEY OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN TAIWAN (IN CHINESE).
     
REPORT ON A 1980 SURVEY OF THE BUILDINGS, FACILITIES, ADMINISTRATION,
COLLECTIONS, BUDGETS, TECHNICAL SERVICES, PUBLIC SERVICES, AND COMMUNITY
SERVICES OF THE LIBRARIES OF 188 SENIOR HIGH, 183 SENIOR VOCATIONAL, 626
JUNIOR HIGH, AND 2,380 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN TAIWAN. ITS PURPOSES WERE TO'
REVEAL FACTS; MAKE AN ANALYTICAL COMPARISON OF SCHOOL LIBRARY STANDARDS IN
TAIWAN AND ABROAD; AND TO DISCOVER PROBLEMS FROM THE STATISTICAL DATA AND
OFFER SUGGESTIONS FOR THEIR SOLUTION.
SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN KERALA.
     
DISCUSSES THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN KERALA, THE SOUTHERNMOST
STATE OF INDIA. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY THE ADMINISTRATION, FINANCE, BOOK
COLLECTIONS, SPACE AND FURNISHINGS OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND THE SERVICES
WHICH THEY OFFER. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONDITION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE
STATE IS FAR FROM SATISFACTORY, ALTHOUGH KERALA IS AHEAD OF OTHER STATES IN
LITERACY AND THE PROPORTION OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ALLOCATED TO EDUCATION.
NOTES THE STEPS WHICH HAVE RECENTLY BEEN TAKEN BY THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TO
IMPROVE THE SITUATION.
MYTH OR REALITY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE SOMA BLACK BOOKFAIR, BRIXTON, LONDON, 22 NOV 80. THE
PAPER WAS ONE OF 3 WORKSHOPS DEVOTED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF EDUCATION.
DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF MULTI-CULTURAL LIBRARY SERVICE, SUGGESTING THAT
COMMITMENT TO SUCH SERVICE BY ANY AUTHORITY MUST LOGICALLY EXTEND INTO AN
ANTI-RACIST POLICY. LANGUAGE, CLASS CULTURES, ACQUISITION OF MATERIALS, STOCK
SELECTION, DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF PROVISION, AND STAFF
ATTITUDES ARE ALL EXAMINED IN RELATION TO PROVISION OF A MULTI-CULTURAL
SERVICE.
HOW SHALL THE LIBRARY APPROACH THE IMMIGRANTS?.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULE
OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THAT
PART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION AND
PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD A
CENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THE
CHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUST
ALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVE
LITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL AND A BETTER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ARE NECESSARY. THE EFFORTS OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY CATERING FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS MUST, APART FROM
COLLECTIONS OF REFERENCE WORKS AND CLASSICS, BE CONCENTRATED ON CONTACT WORK
AND CULTURAL ARRANGEMENTS.
DIFFERENTIATION OF SERVICES OFFERED BY SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES AND CATEGORISATION
OF THEIR USERS.
     
THE STATE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY IN PRESOV CARRIED OUT IN 1980 AN ANALYSIS OF
5,085 REGISTERED LIBRARY USERS ACCORDING TO THEIR AGE AND THEIR WORK
SPECIALISATION. THE METHOD USED FOR THE DIVISION OF USERS INTO CATEGORIES IS
GIVEN. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ARE COMPARED WITH SERVICES OFFERED AND THE
IMPLICATION ASSESSED.
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN NIGERIA.
     
PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF A STUDY OF THE USERS OF 7 NIGERIAN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES ITS FINDINGS ON' THE SEX, AGE RANGE, MARITAL STATUS,
EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AND OCCUPATIONS OF LIBRARY USERS; THE EDUCATIONAL AND
INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF THESE USERS; AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE SATISFIED
WITH THE LIBRARY SERVICES OFFERED. CONCLUDES THAT SCHOOL AGE YOUTHS BETWEEN
15-24 YEARS OF AGE CONSTITUTE THE BULK OF LIBRARY USERS. MOST OF THEM USE THE
LIBRARY FOR THEIR SCHOOL WORK, AND THE MAJORITY ARE NOT SATISFIED EITHER WITH
LIBRARY COLLECTIONS OR SERVICES.
MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AT A PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WERE APPLIED TO STUDY VOLUME OF USE,
USER ACTIVITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF ITEMS SOUGHT BY USERS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY.
STRATIFIED SAMPLING METHODS EMPLOYED TO MEASURE VOLUME OF USE AND USER
ACTIVITY SHOWED THAT THIS MEDIUM-SIZED PUBLIC LIBRARY PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY
4,000 USER SERVICE HOURS PER WEEK. THE AVERAGE VISIT LASTED 34 MINUTES WITH
32% OF ALL VISIT TIME SPENT READING LIBRARY MATERIALS. OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF
ITEMS SOUGHT BY USERS IN THE ADULT SECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 38%. THE
APPLICATION OF THESE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES, WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY
RELATIVELY UNTRAINED STAFF OR VOLUNTEERS, TO PINPOINT POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN
LIBRARY SERVICE IS DISCUSSED.
USE PATTERN OF INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY DELHI LIBRARY' A SURVEY.
     
DESCRIBES BRIEFLY A SURVEY CONDUCTED AT THE I.I.T. DELHI LIBRARY TO FIND OUT
THE USE PATTERN OF THE LIBRARY. IT STARTS WITH THE PURPOSE OF DATA COLLECTION
AND EXPLAINS METHODOLOGY USED, PERIOD OF DATA, TABULATION AND RESULTS
OBTAINED. BASED ON FINDINGS, SOME IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS RELATING TO THE
FUNCTIONING OF THE LIBRARY WERE MADE TO MAKE ITS SERVICES MORE NEED ORIENTED.
PART-TIME STUDENTS: THEIR USE OF A POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY.
     
FOR AN ABSTRACT OF THIS REPORT SEE 81/996. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SELECTED PROBLEMS OF INFORMATION NEED THEORY.
     
DISCUSSES THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE PROBLEMS OF INFORMATION NEEDS AND THE
PATTERN OF THEIR MANIFESTATION. DESCRIBES RELATIONS BETWEEN INFORMATION NEED
AND INFORMATION INTEREST, ATTITUDE, AND MOTIVATION. COMPARES INFORMATION NEED
STUDY DIRECTIONS (WHICH DEPEND ON THE USER'S SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION) AND
INFORMATION ACTIVITIES. LOOKS AT A CLASSIFICATION WHICH GROUPS INFORMATION
NEEDS INTO SOCIAL, CORPORATE, AND PERSONAL, AND MENTIONS THE AMBIGUOUS USE OF
THE TERM 'SOCIAL NEEDS'. DEMONSTRATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL AND
OBJECTIVE/SUBJECTIVE PROPERTIES OF INFORMATION NEEDS.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO A COMMUNITY.
     
DISCUSSES AND SUGGESTS WAYS OF CATERING FOR THE READING NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN THE
AUTHOR'S BIRTHPLACE OF TOKAINO VILLAGE, BUIN, NORTH SOLOMONS PROVINCE, PAPUA
NEW GUINEA. ITS POPULATION IS 200, MOSTLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS, AND MOST
CHILDREN ATTEND THE 3 LOCAL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THERE IS NO LIBRARY SERVICE AT
PRESENT IN THE BUIN AREA, BUT THE BUIN PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVES
BOTH AS A SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARY. A PROPER PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD BE BUILT
IN THE TOWN CENTRE, RUN INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY, AND COMMUNITY
INFORMATION CENTRES OR MOBILE SERVICES SHOULD OPERATE IN EACH AREA, THE FORMER
STAFFED BY A LIBRARIAN AND A TEACHER. SCHOOL DROPOUTS (THE AREA HAS MANY)
COULD COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY
USE, WITH A VIEW TO POSSIBLE LIBRARY TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO WORK SUCCESSFULLY.
INFORMATION-MODELS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
     
THE UK DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT RECENTLY WITHDREW FUNDING FOR UNFINISHED
RESEARCH PROJECTS CONCERNED WITH LOCAL AUTHORITY INFORMATION NEEDS. A MEMBER
OF THE USER PANEL SET UP TO COMMENT ON THE PROJECTS AS THEY PROGRESSED
CONSIDERS THE FACTORS THAT WERE FOUND TO INFLUENCE THE DEMAND FOR AND SUPPLY
OF SUCH INFORMATION.
THE AGENT AND THE LEARNER' INTERACTIONS IN ASSISTED ADULT LIBRARY LEARNING.
     
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ADULT INDEPENDENT LEARNERS AND ASSISTING LIBRARIANS WERE
EXAMINED USING THE CRITICAL INCIDENT TECHNIQUE, A MEANS FOR ELICITING
NARRATIVE DATA. 39 LEARNER'S ADVISORS PROVIDED DESCRIPTIONS OF IMPORTANT
EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE ENCOUNTERS WITH ADULTS WHO SOUGHT NEW SKILLS OR
KNOWLEDGE THROUGH SYSTEMATIC LIBRARY ASSISTANCE. THE AGENT AND THE LEARNER
CREATE COMPLEX ENCOUNTERS IN WHICH THE INFORMATION GIVEN IS LESS IMPORTANT TO
LEARNING THAN THE QUALITY OF THE GIVING.
PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF STOCK IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES.
     
PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF A 1971 USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES STUDY OF THE KINDS OF
LITERATURE HELD BY THE ACADEMY'S LIBRARIES AND THE USE MADE OF THEM. DESCRIBES
STEPS TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDY'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
APROPOS OF THE 'INFORMATION CRISIS'.
     
DISCUSSES PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT 'INFORMATION CRISIS' AND
CRITICALLY APPRAISES THE ARGUMENTS FOR ACCEPTING THAT A CRISIS EXISTS. SHOWS A
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS
AND IN RESEARCH MANPOWER AND CALLS FOR A SYSTEMS APPROACH IN ASSESSING THE
CURRENT INFORMATION SITUATION IN SCIENCE.
ANALYSING INFORMATION-FLOW IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WITH CITATION NETWORKS.
     
SCIENCE CITATION INDEX AND SOCIAL SCIENCES CITATION INDEX ARE BEING USED IN 3
KINDS OF INFORMATION-FLOW STUDY. IN THE 1ST, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, IT IS
USUALLY SIMPLE TO FIND A SMALL AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION, OFTEN ALL THAT
MAY BE NEEDED. IN THE 2ND (CONSTRUCTION OF MAPS OF CITATION-CONNECTED ARTICLES
FOR HISTORICAL STUDIES) AND 3RD (USING CITATIONS AS 'QUALITY' OR 'IMPACT'
INDICATORS), 'NOISE' WILL APPEAR AND MAY BE ELIMINATED BY CERTAIN TECHNIQUES,
WHICH ARE DESCRIBED. A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF THESE APPLICATIONS ARE DESCRIBED
IN SEVERAL QUITE DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS.
THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION.
     
THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION DIFFERS FROM MOST PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN THAT
IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE RANK-ORDER S OF THE ELEMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR
PRODUCTIVITY (FROM HIGHEST DOWN TO LOWEST) RATHER THAN WITH THE NUMERICAL
VALUES N OF THE ELEMENT'S PRODUCTIVITY. THE DEFINING RELATIONSHIP IS THAT S IS
EXPONENTIALLY RELATED TO G, THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION OF THE ELEMENTS OF
RANK-ORDER S OR LESS. THIS IMPLIES A ZIPF-LIKE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEAN
PRODUCTIVITY AND RANK-ORDER, WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE WEBER-FECHNER LAW OF
PSYCHOPHYSICS. A VARIATIONAL SPECIFICATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS GIVEN, AND
IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
BRADFORD AND THAT OF THE USUAL DISTRIBUTIONS IS ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEBESGUE AND RIEMANN INTEGRATION.
NEW TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR THE BLIND AND THE DEAF-BLIND.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IN BRAILLE-PRINTING, USING MODIFIED ELECTRONIC
CALCULATING MACHINES. LETTERS AND SIGNS ARE GIVEN A NUMERAL CODE, AND THESE

PROUST AND MARTIN DU GARD ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
THROUGH THE ELECTRONIC LOOKING GLASS' TELEVISION PROGRAMS IN THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS.
     
IN 1976 A NEW US COPYRIGHT LAW WAS SIGNED THAT INCLUDED THE CREATION OF THE
AMERICAN TELEVISION AND RADIO ARCHIVES, AND WHICH, THROUGH DEPOSITS UNDER THE
COPYRIGHT LAW, GIFTS AND EXCHANGES, AND LIMITED OFF-AIR TAPING PROVIDES FOR
THE RETENTION OF PROGRAMMES OF PRESENT OR POTENTIAL PUBLIC OR CULTURAL
INTEREST, HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OR COGNITIVE VALUE, AND ALL OTHER PROGRAMMES
WORTHY OF PRESERVATION. THE ARCHIVE IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN 1981, AS THE

EVALUATION. ALL ESSENTIAL POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED ARE ORDERED IN A LOGICAL
SEQUENCE OF' PURPOSE TO BE SERVED BY THE WORK UNDER EXAMINATION; ITS PHYSICAL
CHARACTERISTICS; AND INTELLECTUAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS LAYOUT, DETAIL OF
INFORMATION, RELIABILITY, ILLUSTRATIONS. THE FINAL SECTION COVERS THE
EVALUATION OF THE WORK IN RELATION TO BOTH THE FOREGOING ANALYSIS AND EXTERNAL
FACTORS SUCH AS FEASIBILITY OF ACQUISITION.
CONSUMER BUY-LINE.
     
EXAMINES SERVICES AND INFORMATION MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN CANADA FOR DISABLED
PERSONS, INCLUDING TELEPHONES FOR THE HEARING AND SPEECH IMPAIRED, TALKING
BOOKS AND BRAILLE PAMPHLETS, FACT SHEETS FOR THE MENTALLY RETARDED, AND A NEW
BIBLIOGRAPHY ON BUILDING DESIGN FOR THE HANDICAPPED.
PHOTOGRAPHY: ART FORM OR LEGAL FORUM?.
     
THE INCREASING CRITICAL ACCLAIM GIVEN TO PHOTOGRAPHS HAS RESULTED IN THEIR
BEING EXHIBITED IN MUSEUMS AS A NEW ART FORM, BUT THIS BRINGS LEGAL PROBLEMS
FOR THE MUSEUM. SUBJECTS MAY CLAIM INVASION OF PRIVACY, AND PHOTOGRAPHERS MAY
COMPLAIN OF A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT. CAREFUL SIFTING OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES
INVOLVED WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC MATTERS AND ADHERENCE TO REGULATED PROCEDURES
REDUCES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR VEXATIONS CLAIMS TO MANAGEABLE
PROPORTIONS. OUTLINES WHAT THE REGISTRAR CAN DO BY REVIEWING THE PHOTOGRAPHS
AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS TO MINIMISE THE MUSEUM'S EXPOSURE TO THE HAZARDS OF
INVASION OF PRIVACY.

SET-UP, OPERATION, ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS, CONTROLS, MICROFORMS ACCEPTED,
MAGNIFICATIONS, SCREEN TYPE AND SIZE, IMAGE QUALITY, IMAGE ROTATION AND
SCANNING, INDEXING AND RETRIEVAL AIDS, MAINTENANCE, AND THE WARRANTY.
VIDEO FEVER.
     
LIBRARIES' FASCINATION WITH VIDEO IS RESULTING IN SOME ALARMING TRENDS. MEDIA
COLLECTIONS ARE BEING UNDULY INFLUENCED IN FAVOUR OF PUBLIC FILMS-ON-VIDEO,
JEOPARDISING THE CONCEPT OF COLLECTION-BUILDING FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION;
MEDIA FORMATS ARE BEING CONFUSED-BECAUSE FEATURE FILMS ARE THE MAIN CONTENT OF
HOME VIDEO, MANY THINK THAT THE TERMS FILM, VIDEOTAPE, AND VIDEODISC ARE
INTERCHANGEABLE; AND THERE IS THE MANIPULATION OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION BY
THE VIDEO ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS IN THE NEW FORMAT AND
NOTHING IN THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION. THE NEW VIDEO
TECHNOLOGIES DO HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL, BUT IT IS NOT FINANCIALLY REALISABLE OR
PRACTICABLE FOR LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES MUST MAINTAIN THEIR HIGH STANDARDS AND
CONTINUE TO COLLECT ALL MEDIA.
VIDEO ON VIEW.
     
REPORT ON THE VIDEO LIBRARY AT THE INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTS, LONDON,
WHICH PROVIDES PUBLIC ACCESS TO A WIDE RANGE OF VIDEO TAPES CONCERNED WITH THE
ARTS. DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY. PUBLIC ACCESS WILL BE THROUGH
THE PUBLISHED CATALOGUE, AND VISITORS WILL PAY A FEE OF 50 PENCE PER HALF
HOUR. A ROYALTIES SYSTEM WILL BE OPERATED.
VIDEO-A REVOLUTION FOR THE DEAF.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED. VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY HAS MEANT SOMETHING OF A REVOLUTION TO THOSE BORN DEAF, SINCE THEIR
OWN, SIGN, LANGUAGE CAN NOW BE PRESERVED ON VIDEO FILMS, AND THUS, IN A SENSE,
'PUT INTO PRINT'. DESCRIBES WORK CARRIED OUT AT THE COUNTY LIBRARY IN
VASTERAS, SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL CULTURAL COUNCIL, SWEDEN, TO PRODUCE VIDEO
FILMS FOR THE DEAF. PROJECTS SO FAR INCLUDE RECORDINGS OF IBSEN'S 'A DOLL'S
HOUSE', BOOKS, AND CINDERELLA. SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE, WHEN VCRS HAVE BECOME
STANDARD TECHNICAL AIDS FOR THE DEAF, IT SHOULD BE AS NATURAL FOR THE
LIBRARIES TO LEND VIDEOGRAMS TO THE DEAF AS IT IS FOR THEM TO LEND TALKING
BOOKS TO THE BLIND.
SOUND ARCHIVES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIRS.
     
AN ACCOUNT OF THE FOUNDING OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF RECORDED SOUND AND ITS
NATIONAL SOUND ARCHIVE, ITS DEVELOPMENT, AND ITS ACTIVITIES. ITS BRIEF WAS TO
ESTABLISH A FULLY COMPREHENSIVE ARCHIVE, INTERNATIONAL IN SCOPE, THOUGH WITH A
SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRESERVING UK MATERIAL, COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE. IT RECORDS RADIO PROGRAMMES, POETRY READINGS, AND
THEATRE PRODUCTIONS; RECEIVES 1,000 COMMERCIAL GRAMOPHONE RECORDS MONTHLY;
CONTAINS THE BRITISH LIBRARY OF WILDLIFE SOUNDS (BLOWS); HAS
ETHNOMUSICOLOGICAL RECORDINGS FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD; AND HAS A LIBRARY OF
WRITTEN MATTER. IT ORGANISES LECTURES AND PROVIDES A FREE PUBLIC LISTENING
SERVICE. IN SPRING 80, COMPUTERISATION OF THE INDEX WAS BEGUN AND IT IS HOPED
THAT A CATALOGUE WILL BE PRODUCED.
INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR DISSEMINATION OF UNPUBLISHED DOCUMENTS ON MAGNETIC TAPE.
     
CONSIDERS THE ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS IN INFORMATION DISSEMINATION CONCERNING
UNPUBLISHED DOCUMENTS IN MAGNETIC TAPE FORMAT AS EXPERIENCED BY THE SOVIET
ALL-UNION SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRE. FORMULATES SOME
PROVISIONS IMPOSING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ON MAGNETIC TAPE INFORMATION SUPPLIERS
AND USERS.
FOREIGN ECONOMIC LITERATURE AND ITS INFORMATION VALUE.
     
FOREIGN ECONOMIC LITERATURE AVAILABLE IN BULGARIAN LIBRARIES IS USUALLY
CLASSIFIED AS NON-MARXIST PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BEFORE 1900. BETWEEN 1900-45
ONLY A FEW MARXIST PUBLICATIONS CAN BE TRACED. AFTER WORLD WAR II, HOWEVER,
THE SHARE OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE BASED ON MARXISM INCREASED RAPIDLY. THE CYRIL
AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC
LITERATURE IN THE COUNTRY CONSISTING MAINLY OF REFERENCE MATERIAL. THE MAIN
TOPIC AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA LIBRARY IS ECONOMIC HISTORY AND SOME UNIQUE
PUBLICATIONS CAN BE FOUND THERE, FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SOVIET
UNION. ECONOMIC THEORY IS REPRESENTED ABOVE ALL AT THE LIBRARY OF THE
BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. ECONOMIC COLLEGES IN VARNA AND SVISCOV CATER
FOR THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME SPECIALISED COLLECTIONS
AND CATALOGUES AT THE BULGARIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE CENTRAL
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY, ESTABLISHED SOME TIME AG O. THE MAJORITY OF FOREIGN
ECONOMIC LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN, ENGLISH, GERMAN AND FRENCH. ADVOCATES THE
INCREASED EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE NATIONAL RESOURCES LISTED ABOVE.
THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE SWEDISH LABOUR MOVEMENT IS SECURED.
     
DESCRIBES THE LABOUR MOVEMENT ARCHIVES IN STOCKHOLM, WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED IN
1902 TO PRESERVE THE PRINTED HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT AND ARE THE OLDEST OF
THEIR KIND IN THE WORLD.

ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF INFORMATION ANALYSIS PUBLICATIONS OF THE ERIC
CLEARINGHOUSES, JANUARY-DECEMBER 1979.
     
PROVIDES ACCESS TO RECENT RESEARCH REVIEWS, BIBLIOGRAPHIES, STATE-OF-THE-ART
STUDIES, AND INTERPRETIVE STUDIES ON TOPICS OF CURRENT INTEREST IN EDUCATION
PUBLISHED BY THE 16 ERIC CLEARINGHOUSES. THE 10TH OF ITS KIND, IT LISTS A
TOTAL OF 159 ERIC INFORMATION ANALYSIS PRODUCTS DEVELOPED IN THE 1979 CALENDAR
YEAR. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SOURCES FOR THE 'NEW WOMEN'S HISTORY'.
     
THE STAFF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA'S SOCIAL WELFARE HISTORY ARCHIVES
CENTER HAVE, THROUGH THEIR WOMEN'S HISTORY SOURCES SURVEY (WHSS), BEEN
GATHERING DATA FOR THE 'NEW WOMEN'S HISTORY'-THE HISTORY OF ALL WOMEN AND
THEIR ACTIVITIES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE NOT
TRADITIONALLY THE CONCERN OF HISTORIANS. PRESENTS A RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY,
REVIEWS MAJOR SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND DESCRIBES THE PHILOSOPHY UNDERLYING
THE PROJECT.
LIMITS TO COLLABORATIVE AUTHORSHIP IN SCIENCE PUBLISHING.
     
EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TENDENCY FOR INCREASED
COLLABORATION IN SCIENCE PUBLISHING DOES NOT PROCEED WITHOUT LIMIT. THERE
APPEARS TO BE A MAXIMUM EXTENT OF COLLABORATION, RELATED TO THE OPTIMUM SIZE
OF A RESEARCH UNIT. EMPIRICAL CORRECTIONS TO ALLOW FOR THE SOCIOLOGICAL
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VARIOUS SCIENCE SUBJECTS ENABLE A GENERALISED CURVE TO BE
GENERATED WHICH APPEARS TO BE A FEATURE OF RESEARCH GROUPS' DYNAMICS. THE
STUDY INCORPORATES PUBLICATION DATA FROM ONE RESEARCH DIVISION OVER THE LAST
FIFTY YEARS, WITH THE TIME-INDEPENDENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED BY
INTERPOLATION WITH SIMILAR DATA FOR 13 OTHER NEW ZEALAND RESEARCH DIVISIONS
FOR THE PERIOD 1970 TO 1977.
CONVERSION OF MICROFORMATTED SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION DOCUMENT
SOURCES (A REVIEW).
     
DISCUSSES THE OBJECTIVES, TASKS, AND APPLICATIONS OF CONVERTING SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION INTO MICROFORMAT; LOOKS AT THE TECHNOLOGY
AND TECHNIQUES INVOLVED; PRESENTS INFORMATION ABOUT METHODS AND EQUIPMENT FOR
MICROIMAGE CORRECTION DURING CONVERSION; AND EXAMINES THE POTENTIALS OF
PENTAKTA EQUIPMENT WITH REGARD TO CONVERSION AND MICROCOLLECTION UNIFICATION.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY JOURNALS IN RADIO ASTRONOMY.
     
INVESTIGATES DOCUMENT FLOW IN RADIO ASTRONOMY AND USES CITATION COUNTING
TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF TRANSMISSION AND DISSEMINATION OF
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INFORMATION AND TO STUDY THEIR INTERACTION.
A TEST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE LITERATURE HISTORY OF FOUR HISTORICAL
ACCOUNTS OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEM.
     
EXAMINES 4 HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEM IN PHYSICS.
THE PURPOSE IS TO DESCRIBE THE LITERATURE USED BY THE HISTORIES QUANTITATIVELY
USING FREQUENCY OF DATA OF PUBLICATION. ADDITIONALLY, 1 OF THE HISTORIES WAS
TESTED AGAINST THE OTHER 3 TO DETERMINE DIFFERENCES. A MOMENTS TEST AND A T
TEST WERE EMPLOYED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE LITERATURE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS,
WHEN PLOTTED AS A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION DATE IS NON-NORMAL,
NEGATIVELY SKEWED, AND IS PLATYKURTIC. THE TEST FOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONE
HISTORY AND THE CUMULATIVE HISTORIES WAS NON-SIGNIFICANT. INTERPRETATIONS OF
THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED.
PLATE TECTONICS: A STUDY OF TRANSMISSION OF IDEAS.
     
APPLYING BIBLIOMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO THE DATA ANALYSED FROM SCIENCE CITATION
INDEX FOR THE YEARS 1968-77, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LE PICHON'S WELL KNOWN
ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN 1968 IN THE 2JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH1 PROVED
'INFECTIOUS'. THE ARTICLE RECEIVED 593 CITATIONS DURING THIS PERIOD AND
FOLLOWED A WELL DEFINED EPIDEMIC PATTERN, RECEIVING MAXIMUM CITATIONS IN THE
YEAR 1970 AND GETTING SLOWLY STABILISED IN THE YEAR 1974.
STUDIES OF CHEMICAL LITERATURE AND CHANGES IN THE RANKING OF PERIODICALS BY
CITATION ANALYSIS OF DATA FOR 1967-76.
     
STUDIES THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE FROM MANY ANGLES, SUCH AS, SUBJECT-WISE AND
COUNTRYWISE DISPERSION OF PAPERS, DISPERSION OF PERIODICAL AND NON-PERIODICAL
PUBLICATIONS, COUNTRY-WISE DISPERSION OF PATENTS, DURING THE 10-YEAR PERIOD
(1967-76) AS CITED IN 2CHEMICAL REVIEWS.1 THE CHANGE IN THE RANKING OF
PERIODICALS FROM 1967-76 IS ALSO STUDIED.
A STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS OF INFORMATION FLOWS IN SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL
PROBLEM AREAS.
     
DETERMINES VOLUMES OF DOCUMENT FLOW IN SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROBLEM AREAS
AND THE PATTERN OF DISTRIBUTION OF SERIAL AND PERIODICAL ARTICLES. BOTH
PARAMETERS ARE SHOWN TO VARY WITH TIME AND PROBLEM. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES
ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE SUBJECT ORIENTATION OF PUBLICATIONS GROUPED ACCORDING TO
THE BRADFORD 3-ZONE MODEL. SUGGESTS THAT TO DEVELOP REFERENCE/INFORMATION
COLLECTIONS IN SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS, ALL PUBLISHED SOURCES SHOULD BE
SEPARATED INTO 2 BROAD CATEGORIES-CORE PUBLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO A GIVEN
THEME AND THE REST. DESCRIBES A METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING CORE PUBLICATIONS.
PUBLICATION RATE AS A FUNCTION OF LABORATORY SIZE IN THREE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS.
     
IN 3 BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A SINGLE
LABORATORY SIZE AT WHICH THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS PER SCIENTIST IS MAXIMAL
OR MINIMAL. IN A SCATTERGRAM OF THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OF A LABORATORY
AGAINST LABORATORY SIZE, THE HORIZONTAL COORDINATE MEASURES THE NUMBER OF
SCIENTISTS IN A LABORATORY, THE VERTICAL AXIS MEASURES THE NUMBER OF
PUBLICATIONS FROM THE LABORATORY (COUNTING EACH PUBLICATION ONCE REGARDLESS OF
THE NUMBER OF AUTHORS), AND EACH LABORATORY IS REPRESENTED BY ONE POINT.
SCATTERGRAMS FOR THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY (NEW YORK), THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH (LONDON), AND THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (BETHESDA)
ARE EACH DESCRIBED WELL BY A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE ORIGIN. THE SLOPES OF
THE LINES FOR THE THREE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. IN THESE
LABORATORIES, RANGING IN SIZE FROM 1 TO 46 SCIENTISTS, ONE ADDITIONAL
SCIENTIST  INCREASES THE EXPECTED ANNUAL NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OF A
LABORATORY BY APPROXIMATELY 1.1, REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE LABORATORY.
A STUDY OF LITERATURE LISTS IN A MEDICAL JOURNAL.
     
A SURVEY OF 24 LEADING JOURNALS IN A MEDICAL SUBJECT AREA AND THE
CORRESPONDING SECTIONS OF CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORKS IS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON
AN ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF LITERATURE LISTS IN JOURNAL PAPERS AS SECONDARY
INFORMATION TOOLS. ADVOCATES THE USE OF THESE LISTS TO ACHIEVE
COMPREHENSIVENESS IN IDENTIFICATION OF AND QUALITY IN SELECTION OF PRIMARY
DOCUMENTS. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF SECONDARY INFORMATION IN
SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS AND URGES JOURNAL EDITORS TO IMPROVE THEIR
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACTIVITIES.
USE OF DISSERTATIONS IN INFORMATION PROVISION FOR RESEARCHERS.
     
DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR DISSERTATIONS AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR SPECIALISTS
IN A MECHANICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE. SHOWS THAT THE SPECIALISTS USE
DISSERTATIONS COMPARATIVELY INTENSELY AND THAT A DISSERTATION IS USEFUL FOR AT
LEAST 10 YEARS AFTER PUBLICATION. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN DATA ABOUT NEW
DISSERTATIONS, THE SPECIALISTS MAINLY USE AUTHOR ABSTRACTS AND COLLECTIONS OF
ABSTRACTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ISSUED BY THE ALL-UNION CENTRE
OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
REFERENCE UPDATE' CALLAWAY'S PUBLIC DOCUMENT COLLECTION.
     
IN 1974, CALLAWAY COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY, FULTON, MISSOURI, ESTABLISHED A
PUBLIC DOCUMENT COLLECTION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY, SUPPLIED BY THE NUCLEAR
REGULATORY COMMISSION. A NUCLEAR PLANT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN CALLAWAY, AND
THE COLLECTION COMPRISES VIRTUALLY ALL APPLICATIONS, FILINGS, CORRESPONDENCE,
HEARING TRANSCRIPTS, REPORTS AND NEWS RELEASES RELATING TO THE PLANT. THE
COLLECTION GROWS WEEKLY, AND IS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE COMMISSION'S GUIDE,
2PROCEDURES FOR LOCAL DOCUMENT ROOMS1, WRITTEN TO MAKE SUCH TECHNICAL
INFORMATION UNDERSTANDABLE.
INDUSTRIAL ADVERTISEMENTS IN FOREIGN PERIODICALS.
     
DISCUSSES THE CHIEF FEATURES OF INDUSTRIAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR
SUPERHIGH-FREQUENCY RADIOELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN SPECIALIST JOURNALS.
THE ADVERTISEMENTS AND ASSOCIATED PUBLICITY MATERIAL ARE FULL OF VALUABLE
INFORMATION.
SCATTERING OF METAL CUTTING INFORMATION.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY OF THE SCATTERING OF ARTICLES AND INFORMATION
IN THE FIELD OF METAL CUTTING (BASED ON THE 1972-73 ANNUAL VOLUME OF THE
SOVIET ABSTRACTING JOURNAL ON METAL CUTTING MACHINES AND TOOLS). DETERMINES
THE CONCENTRATION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION AND SHOWS THAT EXCLUSION OF
SCATTERED PUBLICATIONS LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION LOSS.
MAINTENANCE OF PERIODICALS COLLECTION' A STATISTICAL CASE STUDY.
     
RESULTS OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT TO ASCERTAIN THE ACTIVE LIFE OF PERIODICALS IN
STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGING FACTOR,
OBSOLESCENCE FACTOR, HALF LIFE, MEAN LIFE AND UTILITY FACTOR ON THE BASIS OF
CITATIONS IN PERIODICALS ARE PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER. THE PERIODICAL, 2JOURNAL
OF THE STRUCTURAL DIVISION OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS1, NEW
YORK, 1974 HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR THE STUDY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE
PERIODICALS IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING LOSE THEIR UTILITY VALUE AFTER 8 YEARS
OF THEIR PUBLICATION.
STUDY OF THEMATIC INTERESTS OF BRANCH ENTERPRISES.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY OF THE SUBJECT INTERESTS OF THE
VARIOUS LEVELS IN THE SOVIET SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY AND DESCRIBES A DATA
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WHICH IS SEARCHED BY COMBINING VARIOUS SIGNS INDICATING THE
SEARCHER'S POSITION IN THE INDUSTRY'S TECHNOLOGICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND
ECONOMIC BRANCH STRUCTURE.
BOOKS BORROWED BY READERS IN THE ADULT FICTION COLLECTION AT PORT MORESBY
PUBLIC LIBRARY AT ELA BEACH.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY CONDUCTED AT PORT MORESBY PUBLIC LIBRARY, ELA BEACH, PAPUA
NEW GUINEA, TO DETERMINE WHAT KINDS OF FICTION BOOKS ELA BEACH READERS FOUND
ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO TAKE HOME. RESULTS ARE SUMMARISED AND NOTE IS MADE OF
THEIR USEFULNESS IN FUTURE PLANNING.

OF POSTGRADUATE THESIS RESEARCH TO THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE IN HUMAN
GEOGRAPHY. THE STUDY IS PLACED IN THE CONTEXT OF SIMILAR WORK IN OTHER SOCIAL
SCIENCES, THE METHODOLOGY IS DESCRIBED AND JUSTIFIED AND THE MAIN RESULTS OF
THE STUDY ARE OUTLINED.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES' THE ORGANISATIONAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK.
     
UNDERTAKEN AS A PRELIMINARY TO A WIDER EXAMINATION OF FUTURE LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT IN THE UK, THIS STUDY OF THE ORGANISATIONAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
WITHIN WHICH LIBRARIES OF ALL KINDS WILL BE ABLE TO COOPERATE EFFICIENTLY IN A
COORDINATED LIBRARY SERVICE GIVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE ROLES OF CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL. THE REPORT REVIEWS
THE EXTENT OF EXISTING CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES, DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS OF COORDINATION AND
POLICY MAKING, IDENTIFIES POSSIBLE FRAMEWORKS FOR A COORDINATED SERVICE, AND
CONCLUDES WITH SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
COMMUNITY ANALYSIS FOR THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES SOME OF THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE KNOWN ABOUT THE
COMMUNITY SERVED BY A PUBLIC LIBRARY, HOW THAT INFORMATION CAN BEST BE SECURED
(COMMUNITY ANALYSIS), AND HOW IT MIGHT BE USED. COMMUNITY ANALYSIS SETS LIMITS
AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE IN PROVIDING LIBRARY SERVICES.
SOME THOUGHTS ON ORGANIZING A NEW BRANCH LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
PERSONAL REMINISCENCES AND THOUGHTS ON THE PLANNING OF BRANCH PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES, WITH BRIEF DISCUSSION OF ESTIMATES, THE BUILDING PROGRAMME,
COLLECTION BUILDING, FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, AND OCCUPATION OF THE BUILDING.

IN THE CONTEXT OF CAMPUS-WIDE PLANNING AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBES 2 PROJECTS FUNDED
THROUGH THE COUNCIL FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SMALL COLLEGES (CASC) TO DEVELOP
APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S TASK OF FORMING A SYSTEM RELATIVE TO THE COMPETENCE
OF THE ADVISORY AND DECISION-MAKING BODIES OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY.
     
THE FREIE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN (BERLIN UNIVERSITY) IN WEST BERLIN WAS TAKEN AS
AN EXAMPLE FOR ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S
TASK OF FORMING A LIBRARY SYSTEM. SUCCESS IN THIS TASK DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE
LAWS GOVERNING THE LIBRARY BUT IS AFFECTED BY THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF THE
COMPETENT UNIVERSITY BODIES. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO
COORDINATE, SUPERVISE AND ADVISE THE DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IN ORDER TO CARRY
OUT THIS TASK THE SYSTEM PLANNING DEPARTMENT MUST BE COMPLETELY INTEGRATED
INTO THE UNIVERSITY INTERNAL INFORMATION STREAM, IT MUST BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE
INITIATIVES INTO THE ADVISORY AND DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES OF THE UNIVERSITY
AND FOLLOW THESE UP. THIS INTERDEPENDENT WORK WAS STUDIED IN DETAIL AT THE
BERLIN UNIVERSITY. WEAK POINTS IN THE SYSTEM WERE ANALYSED AND SUGGESTIONS FOR
REDUCING PREJUD ICIAL EFFECTS WERE MADE. THIS STUDY SHOULD GIVE RISE TO
INTERNAL DISCUSSION AT THE UNIVERSITY CONCERNED AND MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST TO
OTHER EXTERNAL LIBRARIES OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE.
READERSHIP SURVEYS AND LOCAL LIBRARY CO-OPERATION.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF LITERATURE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH
RESEARCHERS AND LIBRARIANS ON READERSHIP SURVEYS AND LIBRARY COOPERATION IN
THE UK AND DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A STUDY INTO ACADEMIC
LIBRARY USE AND COOPERATION IN SCOTLAND. CONCLUDES THAT THERE CAN BE LITTLE
JUSTIFICATION IN SUCH A SURVEY, BUT THAT A SMALLER PROJECT ON HOW THE
INFORMATION NEEDS OF ACADEMICS ARE SATISFIED IN THEIR OWN INSTITUTION'S
LIBRARY WOULD BE USEFUL. SUGGESTS A METHODOLOGY FOR THE PROJECT.
REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION SERVICE.
     
THE JAPAN MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL ASSOCIATION OF
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN JAPAN. IT OWES MUCH FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT TO THE USA AND
EUROPE, AND AS SUCH HAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTACT WITH MEDICAL LIBRARIES IN ASIAN,
AND PARTICULARLY SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES. WHILST THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN MEDICAL
INFORMATION CENTER (SEAMIC) HELD ITS 1ST WORKSHOP IN TOKYO IN 1973, THE
PROBLEM OF THE VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE REGION IS A BARRIER TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. ONLY BY REMOVING
THESE BARRIERS AND ESTABLISHING STRONG REGIONAL COOPERATION, CAN INFORMATION
BE EXCHANGED FREELY, WHICH WILL BE A SURE STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL
INFORMATION.
A DESIGN FOR COOPERATION AND NETWORKING AMONG ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF IRAN.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY.) THE STATUS AND ATTITUDES OF
IRANIAN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WAS INVESTIGATED, USING QUESTIONNAIRES AND
INTERVIEWS. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT THE COUNTRY'S ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WERE
NOT FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT BE AND THAT GRADUAL GENERAL CHANGES,
PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COOPERATION AND JOINT ACTION, WERE TAKING PLACE.
AN OVERALL PLAN WAS DEVISED WITH THE FOLLOWING FEATURES' COOPERATIVE
ACQUISITION, CENTRALISED AND COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING, EXPANSION OF LIBRARY
SERVICES, AND COOPERATIVE MANPOWER RESOURCES.
THE SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARY AND THE NEW COOPERATION.
     
ALTHOUGH SPIRALING COSTS AND REDUCED BUDGETS REQUIRE THAT SMALL ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES FORM CLUSTERS TO SHARE RESOURCES AND SERVICES, CONSORTIA AND LIBRARY
NETWORKS SO FAR HAVE TAKEN ONLY TENTATIVE OR SHALLOW STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION.
REAL AND MEANINGFUL STEPS CAN AND MUST BE TAKEN TO DEVELOP JOINT ACQUISITION
POLICIES, EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROCEDURES, COOPERATIVE
REFERENCE SERVICES, AND DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERIODICALS. RESOURCE
UTILISATION IN THE AREAS OF TECHNICAL PROCESSES, STAFF, AND EQUIPMENT CAN BE
IMPROVED, AND LIBRARIANS NEED TO ADOPT AN ATTITUDE OF INTERDEPENDENCY AND
SHARED MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY. CLUSTERS OF 5 TO 10 LIBRARIES WITHIN A LIMITED
GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY OFFER A FEASIBLE FRAMEWORK WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IN EACH
COMMITTED TO SEEK OUT, DEVELOP, AND MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE PROGRAMMES. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARIES OF THE ROYAL DUTCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AND
THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DELFT' A REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST YEAR.
     
FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF A WORKING PARTY OF LIBRARY REPRESENTATIVES
FROM THE KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE ACADEMIE VAN WETENSCHAPPEN (ROYAL DUTCH
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES) AND THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DELFT IN THE NETHERLANDS
IN 1979 FOR CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 2 LIBRARIES, A FORMAL COOPERATIVE
AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN 1980. REGULAR MEETINGS OF STAFF FROM BOTH LIBRARIES ARE
NOW HELD TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE AREAS OF COOPERATION. IN BOTH LIBRARIES
CONSIDERATION OF THE PARTNER'S HOLDINGS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE THE
PURCHASE OF NEW BOOKS, PERIODICALS AND REPORTS. THE LIBRARIES FURTHER
COOPERATE CLOSELY IN INTERLIBRARY LENDING AND THE PROVISION OF COMPUTERISED
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES. IN ADDITION BOTH LIBRARIES HAVE AGREED WITH
THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY INTERNATIONAL RETRIEVAL SERVICES TO ACT AS A BACK-UP
SERVICE FOR LIBRARIES IN T HE NETHERLANDS IN PROVIDING COPIES OF ARTICLES
RETRIEVED IN COMPUTER SEARCHES.
DATA ASSESSMENT IN A REGIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY CONSULTANT/EXTENSION PROGRAM;
INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. PAPERS AND REPORT, NO 18.
     
IN JAN 72, THE KENTUCKY-OHIO-MICHIGAN REGIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY NETWORK
INITIATED AN EXTRAMURAL PROGRAMME WITH A COORDINATOR AT EACH OF ITS
PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES TO FUNCTION AS LIAISON BETWEEN THE NETWORK AND BASIC
UNITS. DATA COLLECTION DEVICES WERE DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE
PROGRAMME, IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO FOSTER RESPONSIBLE HOSPITAL LIBRARY
PARTICIPATION IN THE BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATION NETWORK. THE EXTRAMURAL
PROGRAMME IS EVALUATED IN THIS REPORT FROM 4 PERSPECTIVES' (1) NATURE OF
ACTIVITIES, (2) INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, (3) NETWORK CHANGES, AND (4) PROGRAMME
OBJECTIVES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

NATIONWIDE (US) PROJECT TO MICROFILM AGRICULTURE-RELATED PUBLICATIONS ARE
DESCRIBED. THE PROGRAMME IS A COOPERATIVE ONE BETWEEN THE NATIONAL
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARIES OF VARIOUS LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS, AND
INCLUDES MILLIONS OF PAGES OF MATERIALS PUBLISHED PRIOR TO 1970.
METHODS OF EVALUATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
     
REVIEWS TECHNIQUES FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
INTERLIBRARY COMPARISON METHODS ARE STUDIED WITH REFERENCE TO A BRITISH
LIBRARY PROJECT (SEE 81/1927).
ACADEMIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: A SELF STUDY.
     
RESULTS OF A 4-MONTH LIBRARY SELF-EVALUATION PROGRAMME CONDUCTED BY STAFF
MEMBERS AT CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ARE REPORTED. THE STUDY WAS
CONDUCTED USING THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (ALDP), A
SELF-IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY FOR LIBRARIES TO EVALUATE AND DEVELOP THEIR
PERFORMANCE. THE STUDY TEAM CONSISTING OF 4 TASK GROUPS ADDRESSED THESE
ISSUES: (1) SERVICES AND COLLECTIONS, (2) MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, (3) HUMAN
RESOURCES, AND (4) TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT WORK.
     
PROPOSES TO EVALUATE THE FUNCTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF A RESEARCH INSTITUTE
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM BY STUDYING (1) THE EXTENT TO WHICH RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) STAFF INFORMATION NEEDS ARE SATISFIED AND (2) THE
INFLUENCE OF THE SYSTEM ON THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OF THE R&D WORK.
ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY CAN BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO R&D STAFF TIME SAVED THROUGH
BEING FREED FROM INFORMATION COLLECTION, RETRIEVAL, AND PROCESSING. PRESENTS
THE RESULTS OF APPLYING THESE EVALUATION TECHNIQUES TO THE SOYUZBYTCHIM DESIGN
OFFICE.
CLAIM: SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE MARKET FOR R&D.
     
WHILST IT MAY BE FELT THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT CARE
LESS ABOUT RESEARCH CENTRES, THE SMALL REMAINING MINORITY WILL INCLUDE MANY
INTERESTED PRACTITIONERS. CLAIM, THE CENTRE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT RECOGNISES THAT MANY OF ITS ACTIVITIES OPERATE IN SOMETHING OF A
MARKET PLACE AT THE MERCY OF ALL KINDS OF FORCES. DESCRIBES THE WORK OF, AND
INTEREST IN, CLAIM AND R&D ACTIVITIES RESPECTIVELY.
ORGANISING A MIDWIFERY SCHOOL LIBRARY' GUIDELINES FOR THE NON-LIBRARIAN (PART
2).
     
CONCLUSION OF A 2-PART ARTICLE ON THE ORGANISATION OF A MIDWIFERY SCHOOL
LIBRARY, WRITTEN FOR THE NON-LIBRARIAN. IT IS VITAL THAT THE LIBRARIAN IS IN
CHARGE OF BOOK SELECTION AND PURCHASE, AND DOES NOT HAVE TO WORK THROUGH A
LIBRARY COMMITTEE. PRESENTS GUIDELINES ON BOOK PURCHASING, ACCESSIONS
REGISTER, LOANS SYSTEM, OVERDUE AND LOST BOOKS, AND CATALOGUING AND
CLASSIFICATION. ALSO INCLUDED ARE ADDRESSES OF LIBRARY STATIONERS AND
PUBLISHERS.
ORGANISING A MIDWIFERY SCHOOL LIBRARY' GUIDELINES FOR THE NON-LIBRARIAN (PART
1).
     
ALTHOUGH THE 1972 BRIGGS REPORT RECOMMENDED THE APPOINTMENT OF TRAINED
LIBRARIANS TO TAKE CHARGE OF NURSING LIBRARIES. OFTEN HOWEVER, THE SENIOR
MIDWIFERY TUTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING THE MIDWIFERY SCHOOL LIBRARY.
PRESENTS GUIDELINES ON THE ORGANISATION OF SUCH A LIBRARY FOR THE
NON-LIBRARIAN IN CHARGE. COVERS ACCESS TO THE LIBRARY, BOOK SELECTION,
JOURNALS AND PUBLICITY.
PLANNING FOR LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS' THE ROLE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT.
     
INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH ADMINISTRATORS AND
LIBRARIANS SELECT, ACQUIRE, ANALYSE, AND UTILISE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION
SOURCES FOR PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING BASED ON INFORMATION RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT IS A PREREQUISITE FOR LIBRARY ORGANISATIONAL PLANNING AND
EFFECTIVENESS.
THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY TRUSTEE.
     
PRESENTATIONS BY PANEL MEMBERS AT THE LIBRARY TRUSTEE WORKSHOP, MISSOURI
WESTERN STATE COLLEGE, ST. JOSEPH, 16 MAR 81; THE WORKSHOP WAS ONE OF A SERIES
SPONSORED BY THE TRUSTEES AND CITIZENS DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION IN COOPERATION WITH THE MISSOURI LIBRARY NETWORKS. THE
PRESENTATIONS CONCERN THE TRUSTEE'S ROLE WITH REGARD TO LIBRARY POLICY (BY
WARREN PLUMB), PERSONNEL (CAROLYN G. LENHART), LIBRARY PROGRAMME (JANE
CARVER), AND THE COMMUNITY (LELA BELL).

OF SERVICES. A PLAN OF THE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IS ALSO INCLUDED.
LIBRARY BUDGETS: HARD SELL FOR A SOFT SERVICE.
     
STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO PLANNED LIBRARY BUDGETING, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO
BUDGETING FOR ONTARIO LIBRARIES. ALL ONTARIO LIBRARY BOARDS ARE REQUIRED BY
LAW TO PREPARE A BUDGET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE
MUNICIPALITY IN WHICH THEY OPERATE-EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF THE BUDGET SITUATION
IN RICHMOND HILL, WINDSOR AND THE REGIONAL MUNICIPALITY OF WATERLOO. HINTS ARE
GIVEN ON AVOIDING 'BUDGET BUZZWORDS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A LIBRARY'S
IMAGE AND ITS ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DEVELOP ITS PROGRAMME AROUND A COMMUNITY'S
REAL NEEDS IS DISCUSSED.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND FACSIMILE.
     
ADVANCES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS HAVE MADE POSSIBLE MORE RAPID AND
COST-EFFECTIVE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION. LIBRARIES SHOULD NOW RECEIVE AND
CONSIDER A NUMBER OF COMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING DEVICES SUCH AS
FACSIMILE, COPIES, WORD PROCESSORS, TERMINALS, AND COMPUTERS, IN ORDER TO
ATTAIN INTEGRATION OF DEVICES AND PROCESSES. EXAMINES FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION
AND DISCUSSES ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.
THE IMPACT OF OFFICE AUTOMATION ON LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES THE PROCESSES AND COMPONENT FEATURES OF THE AUTOMATED OFFICE AND THE
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THEM. SINCE MOST PEOPLE IN THE LIBRARY WORLD SPEND A
CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THEIR TIME PERFORMING TRADITIONAL 'OFFICE' FUNCTIONS,
THE LIBRARY COMMUNITY SHOULD BECOME MORE FULLY AWARE OF DEVELOPMENTS, TESTING,
AND APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATED OFFICE TECHNOLOGIES.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY' A BIBLIOGRAPHY.

PUBLICATION ALTERNATIVES; COMPUTER CONFERENCING, ELECTRONIC MAIL; VIDEOTEXT
SYSTEMS, VIDEODISCS; COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY; NETWORKS; ONLINE INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL, CATALOGUING; MINICOMPUTERS AND MICROCOMPUTERS.
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON LIBRARY AND OFFICE WORKERS.
     
THE SUCCESSFUL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LIBRARY AUTOMATED SYSTEMS REQUIRE
CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE HUMAN PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS OF SYSTEM OPERATORS AND
USERS. PRESENTS A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, FOCUSING ON AUTOMATION FEARS,
THEIR UNDERLYING CAUSES, AND SOME OF THE MEANS AVAILABLE FOR THEIR REDUCTION
OR ELIMINATION.
MILWAUKEE PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1942-1980' A PIONEER IN DATA PROCESSING.
     
MILWAUKEE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WITH ITS PRESENT SYSTEM OF 50 CIRCULATION CONTROL
TERMINALS, 17 CRTS, 4 MINI-COMPUTERS, 105 BILLION CHARACTERS OF ON-LINE DISC
STORAGE, 7 TAPE DRIVES, AS WELL AS THE USE OF THE CITY HALL MAIN FRAMES, HAS
HAD A LONG HISTORY OF DATA PROCESSING DATING BACK TO 1942. THE
DISAPPOINTMENTS, PROBLEMS, AND SUCCESSES, ESPECIALLY WITH MAJOR CONTROL OF ITS
DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS, ARE DISCUSSED.
THE SIBIL SYSTEM (LAUSANNE).
     
THE SIBIL ON-LINE COMPUTERISED SYSTEM FOR ACQUISITIONS, CATALOGUING, AND
LENDING IS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE CANTON AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY OF LAUSANNE.
PROVIDES A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM, OUTLINES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS,
AND HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEMS TO BE OVERCOME IF THE SYSTEM IS ADOPTED BY OTHER
LIBRARIES.
ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION' A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE.
     
DISCUSSES WHY THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES
AND PRODUCTS (BY BOTH COMMERCIAL AND NON-PROFIT VENDORS OF AUTOMATION) TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES; WHY AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING AND PREPARATION, WHOLE
SUB-SYSTEMS DO NOT FUNCTION OR PERFORM AT UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR PRICES; AND
WHY, IN THE CONTINUING EXCHANGE BETWEEN REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORKS AND NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND AGENCIES, THERE ARE SO FEW ACHIEVEMENTS IN COOPERATION, JOINT
DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDING, AND CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. VENDORS MUST STOP
USING PROFESSIONAL MARKETERS IN PLANNING DEVELOPMENTS; THEY MUST COMMUNICATE
DIRECTLY WITH LIBRARIES INSTEAD. THEY SHOULD ALSO COOPERATE AMONGST THEMSELVES
AND REALISE THE POTENTIAL OF WORKING WITH LIBRARY NETWORKS RATHER THAN
INDIVIDUAL NETWORK MEMBERS.
TO AUTOMATE OR NOT TO AUTOMATE?.
     
TRANSLATION OF A PRESENTATION IN FRENCH AT THE CONFERENCE OF COOPERATIVE
LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTATION OFFICERS, MOSCOW, OCT 80. REVIEWS THE MAIN
ANALYSES WHICH MUST PRECEDE ANY DECISION TO AUTOMATE A LIBRARY; LOOKS AT THE
CRITERIA ON WHICH SUCH A DECISION MUST REST; AND UNDERLINES THE IMPACT OF
AUTOMATION ON STAFF.
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARY AUTOMATION,
TAIPEI, TAIWAN, 14-19 FEB 81. POINTS OUT THAT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN
LIBRARY AUTOMATION HAS EMPHASISED COOPERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS
THAT WOULD FACILITATE AUTOMATION PROJECTS RATHER THAN THE ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
OF SUCH PROJECTS. DESCRIBES THE AREAS IN WHICH STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED
OR ARE BEING DEVELOPED.
THE FINNISH WAY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTOMATION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. THE METROPOLITAN AREA CONSISTING OF HELSINKI,
ESPOO, VANTAA, AND KAUNIAINEN CITIES HAS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATIVE
LIBRARY AUTOMATION. THE CITY LIBRARIES ARE AIMING AT ESTABLISHING JOINT DATA
SYSTEMS AND DATA BASES, WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR INDEPENDENCE AS LOCAL
GOVERNMENT UNITS. THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL AND BOOK FILE UPDATING
SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY OPERATIONAL; THE CATALOGUING SYSTEM WILL BE STARTED ONCE A
NATIONAL DECISION REGARDING CENTRALISED LIBRARY SERVICES HAS BEEN MADE; AND
THE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS DUE TO COMMENCE IN SPRING 81.
THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN LIBRARIES' PROCEEDINGS OF A
CONFERENCE.

LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY. THE CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE POLYTECHNIC OF CENTRAL
LONDON, SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT, 23 APR 80. PAPERS ARE AS FOLLOWS' THE EFFECTS OF
DECISION MAKING ON AUTOMATED SYSTEMS, BY ROLLO WOODS; COMPUTERISATION AND
LIBRARY ORGANISATION, BY NEIL MCLEAN; THE ATTITUDE OF NON-SYSTEMS STAFF TO
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS, BY NORMAN TURNER; AND THE EFFECTS OF INTER-LIBRARY
CO-OPERATION ON THE PRIORITIES OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES, BY REG PRINGLE.
CHOOSING A MICROCOMPUTER FOR THE LIBRARY.
     
AN ANALYSIS (BASED LOOSELY ON THE AUTHOR'S RECENT EXPERIENCES) OF THE
HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION SOURCES AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIANS CONSIDERING
ADDING A MICROCOMPUTER TO THEIR RETRIEVAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS. TO REDUCE
DEVELOPMENT TIME AND COST, LIBRARY PROCEDURES SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO MATCH
AVAILABLE SOFTWARE WHERE POSSIBLE, RATHER THAN COMMISSIONING NEW SOFTWARE.
THE MYTHS AND MYSTIQUES OF PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION.
     
REVIEWS MYTHS SURROUNDING THE SUBJECT OF PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION, AND
CONCLUDES THAT IF ADMINISTRATION IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL
TRUTHS MUST BE OBSERVED' (1) PEOPLE NEED TO BE GIVEN REASONS; (2) PRAISE
SHOULD BE PUBLIC, BUT CRITICISM ALWAYS PRIVATE; (3) PROMISES MUST BE KEPT AND
THREATS ENFORCED, OR NEITHER SHOULD BE MADE; FAIRNESS, IMPARTIALITY, AND ABOVE
ALL, CONSISTENCY ARE VITAL; AND (5) WHEN POLICY IS UNJUST, THE PERSONNEL
ADMINISTRATOR MUST FIGHT FOR PEOPLE.
I'M TYPING AS FAST AS I CAN.
     
DECRIES THE CHANGES WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE IN LIBRARIANSHIP, WITH REDUCED
FUNDS, REDUCED STAFFING AND A RESULTANT ONUS ON THE LIBRARIAN TO PERFORM
MULTIPLE ROLES, OFTEN DISTINCT FROM LIBRARIANSHIP, TO THE POINT WHERE TYPING
SKILLS MAY BE DEMANDED OF A JOB APPLICANT.
FRINGE BENEFITS IN LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES OF THE UNITED STATES-THE
PROFESSIONAL'S GUIDE TO 1980.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ANNUAL BUDGETS OF AT LEAST $1 MILLION. 76 LIBRARIES
THROUGHOUT THE USA GAVE DETAILS OF BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO FULL-TIME
PROFESSIONAL STAFF CONCERNING HOURS OF WORK, PAID HOLIDAYS, LEAVE, SICK LEAVE,
DEATH LEAVE, RETIREMENT, HEALTH INSURANCE, LIFE INSURANCE, PARKING, AND
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. THE SURVEY IS CARRIED OUT ANNUALLY.
EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION' EXPECTANCY THEORY AT WORK.
     
EXPECTANCY THEORIES OF EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF MUCH
EMPIRICAL RESEARCH AND THEORETICAL WRITING. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN,
HOWEVER, TO ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN THE WORKPLACE. SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY
BE BECAUSE THE MODEL, AS USUALLY DISCUSSED, IS HIGHLY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND. TRANSLATES EXPECTANCY THEORY INTO A FORM THAT IS BOTH
UNDERSTANDABLE AND USABLE BY LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS.
SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION' NEW YORK CHAPTER. SALARY SURVEY, 1979.

OUT BY A COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE NORWEGIAN STATE DIRECTORATE FOR PUBLIC AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THE COMMITTEE EXAMINED 1,316 LIBRARIES OUTSIDE OSLO DURING
ITS PREPARATION OF THE PROPOSAL. THE IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY IS ACKNOWLEDGED
AND THE PROPOSAL DIVIDES LIBRARY FUNCTIONS INTO 'SHALL' FUNCTIONS REQUIRED BY
EXISTING LEGISLATION AND OPTIONAL FUNCTIONS.
THE NEWEST AND LARGEST CITY LIBRARY IN FINLAND.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A FINNISH ISSUE. DESCRIBES JYVASKYLA CITY LIBRARY'S NEW MAIN
LIBRARY, WHICH WAS INAUGURATED IN 1980. IT SERVES THE CITY'S 63,000
INHABITANTS AND IS ALSO DESIGNATED PROVINCE LIBRARY OF KESKI-SUOMI, PROVIDING
CENTRAL LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE PROVINCE'S 240,000 INHABITANTS. INCLUDES
DETAILED PLANS OF THE BUILDING.
A NEW LIBRARY IN AN OLD TIMBER HOUSE ENVIRONMENT.

TAMMISAARI (IN THE SWEDISH EKENAS REGION OF FINLAND), A CONSCIOUS EFFORT WAS
MADE TO RELATE TO THE TOWN'S TIMBER HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. DESCRIBES ITS PLANNING
AND CONSTRUCTION, ACTIVITIES, AND THE LOCAL LIBRARY NETWORK. INCLUDES PLANS OF
THE BUILDING.
GJOVIK LIBRARY AND OPPLAND COUNTY LIBRARY IN NEW PREMISES.
     
THE MUNICIPALITY OF GJOVIK, NORWAY, HAS 36,000 INHABITANTS (15,000 OF WHOM
LIVE IN THE TOWN). THERE IS A MAIN LIBRARY AND 3 BRANCH LIBRARIES. IN 1979,
121,000 VOLUMES WERE BORROWED (94,000 BEING FROM THE MAIN LIBRARY). IN FEB 80,
THE 96,000-VOLUME MAIN LIBRARY (OFFICIAL TITLE GJOVIK LIBRARY AND OPPLAND
COUNTY LIBRARY) MOVED INTO NEW PREMISES. PRESENTS PLANS AND A DESCRIPTION OF
THE BUILDING.
OPEN SPACE AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS.
     
AFTER NEARLY A DECADE OF PLANNING CANADA'S NEW HAMILTON PUBLIC LIBRARY OPENED
ON 15 OCT 80. CIRCULATION HAS INCREASED, FULL-TIME STAFF HAS INCREASED BY 20,
AND FLOOR SPACE HAS ALMOST TRIPLED. UNUSUAL FEATURES INCLUDE A TREE-HOUSE FOR
CHILDREN, A MUSIC ROOM WITH A PIANO, AND A MULTI-PURPOSE ACTIVITY AREA WHICH
SEATS 325-350 PEOPLE.
THE HANDICAPPED AND THE LIBRARY BUILDING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED. IN 1975
THE NORWEGIAN MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS ISSUED GUIDELINES FOR BUILDING DESIGN
TO ACCOMMODATE WHEELCHAIR USERS, GIVING STANDARD DIMENSIONS FOR DOORS, LIFTS,
TOILETS AND OTHER BUILDING FEATURES. ALSO INCLUDED WERE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE
USE OF SYMBOLS TO MARK, FOR EXAMPLE, ENTRANCES AND PATHS. IN 1976 THE
NORWEGIAN MINISTRY OF LABOUR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED NEW RULES TO
SUPPLEMENT THE OFFICIAL BUILDING REGULATIONS OF 1969. THE BASIC REQUIREMENT IS
THAT PUBLIC BUILDINGS SHALL BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE BLIND AND OTHER DISABLED
PERSONS. SUMMARISES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THESE REGULATIONS.
THE URQUHART BUILDING OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION' THE DESIGN OF A
SINGLE FUNCTION LIBRARY BUILDING.
     
A STAGED BUILDING PROGRAMME HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MEET THE GROWTH IN DEMAND ON
THE BLLD AND TO HOUSE ITS INCREASED STOCK. THE URQUHART BUILDING, THE SITE'S
MAIN BUILDING, IS DESIGNED FOR EASY ACCESS TO HIGH-USE STOCK, FAST FLOW OF
MATERIAL, AND FUTURE FLEXIBILITY. THE GROUND FLOOR RECEIVES AND DESPATCHES
POST, AND MECHANICAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT MOVES REQUEST FORMS AND LIBRARY
MATERIALS TO THE PROCESSING AND RECORDS AREA ON THE 1ST FLOOR AND THE 6
FURTHER STOREYS THAT HOUSE STOCK. THERE ARE LARGE AREAS FOR ACCESS AND
MACHINERY ON THE STORAGE FLOORS. THE SHELVING FOR BOTH HARD-COPY AND
MICROFORMS WAS SPECIALLY DESIGNED. MECHANICAL HANDLING SYSTEMS INCLUDE
CONVEYORS IN THE PACKING AREAS, AUTOMATIC VERTICAL ELEVATORS, AND MOBILE
CONTAINERS TO CARRY REQUEST FORMS BETWEEN REQUEST PROCESSING AND STORAGE
AREAS. OTHER BUILDINGS ON THE SITE WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE STOCK EXPANSION.
BEYOND CARNEGIE' THE LIBRARIAN AS COMMUNITY ACTIVIST.
     
THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY, AND IN
CANADA, DESPITE A TIGHTENING OF THE MONEY SUPPLY, PUBLIC LIBRARIES CONTINUE TO
PROVIDE COMMUNITY SERVICES, WITH A CHANGE IN OUTLOOK FROM LIBRARIES AS BOOK
REPOSITORIES TO LIBRARIES AS TOTAL INFORMATION SOURCES. DESCRIBES SOME
CANADIAN LIBRARY SERVICES OFFERING A RANGE OF INFORMATION AND ACTIVITIES FROM
YOGA CLASSES TO MOTORCYCLE CLUBS. IF LIBRARIES FAIL TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN
PROVIDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION, OTHERS WILL ASSUME THAT ROLE.
IMPROVING INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MANAGERS AND SPECIALISTS.

THIS VOLUME COMPRISES THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND SESSIONS CHAIRPERSONS, BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON AUTHORS,
AND ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS (IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH). FULL TEXT OF SELECTED PAPERS
APPEARS IN MICROFICHE (ALSO INCLUDED IN A DOCKET AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK),
WHILST OTHER PAPERS APPEAR ONLY ON AUDIO TAPE.
IRANIAN DOCUMENTATION CENTRE.
     
DR. MERVIN SMITH, SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL TREATY ORGANIZATION (CENTO)
ORIGINATED THE IDEA OF AN IRANIAN NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE. AT HIS
REQUEST DR. JOHN HARVEY, AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY SUBMITTED PROPOSALS FOR THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF IRANDOC AND TEBROC TO THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND HIGHER
EDUCATION. THE 2 CENTRES WERE ESTABLISHED IN 1967. THEY CAME UNDER THE
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL OF THE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH AND PLANNING IN SCIENCE
AND EDUCATION WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1968.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL LIBRARIES AS A BASIS FOR GOVERNMENTAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
DESCRIBES THE PRESENT FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENTAL LIBRARIES WHICH GIVES THEM
INDEPENDENCE, AND OUTLINES A POSSIBLE GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WHOSE
FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE RECEPTION, ADAPTATION, CONCENTRATION, STORAGE, COMBINATION
AND SERVICE. A GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEM IS ABLE TO FULFIL TASKS WHICH
COULD NOT BE FULFILLED UP TO NOW; AND IT WILL BE UP TO FUTURE USERS TO
DISCOVER THE QUALITIES OF SUCH A NEW INFORMATION SYSTEM WITHIN A GOVERNMENTAL
LIBRARY.
TOWARD A DEFINITION OF DOCUMENT CHARACTERISTICS FOR A DIFFERENTIATED
MANAGEMENT SERVICE.
     
DISCUSSES THE TECHNIQUES OF INFORMATION SURVEY WRITING FOR MANAGEMENT
PERSONNEL AND CONSIDERS THE ROLE OF THE INFORMATION SURVEY WITHIN THE
SECONDARY DOCUMENT SYSTEM. IDENTIFIES CRITERIA FOR THE CONDUCT OF SUCH
SURVEYS.
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE USER OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND THE
INFORMATION OFFICER.
     
TO ACHIEVE GOOD RESULTS, AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
INFORMATION OFFICER HAS TO TAKE PLACE. CONDITIONS FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
INFORMATION WORK ARE INVESTIGATED AND PARAMETERS FOR ITS DETERMINATION
SUGGESTED. THE DOMINANT FACTOR INFLUENCING THE PROCESS OF BOTH EFFECTIVE
PROCESSING AND USE OF INFORMATION IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
OFFICER AND THE USER EXCHANGE INFORMATION.
AFTER FIVE YEARS' AN ASSESSMENT OF THE AMENDED U.S. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.
     
ASSESSMENT OF THE ACT WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
ARCHIVISTS, SUGGESTING THAT WHILST THE ACT IS WORKING, IT RELEASES SOME OF THE
INFORMATION AGENCIES WOULD LIKE TO WITHHOLD AND WITHOLDS SOME INFORMATION THAT
REQUESTERS WOULD LIKE RELEASED. OVERALL, IT PROBABLY STRIKES A BALANCE. A
CONTINUING CHALLENGE IN THE 1980S IS THE STATEMENT OF RECORDS BY ARCHIVISTS SO
THAT EVERYONE-AGENCIES, RESEARCHERS, LAWYERS, AND EVEN JUDGES-WILL UNDERSTAND
IT.
ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF AN INFORMATION SERVICE ON TECHNICAL STANDARDS.
     
PRESENTS ACCOUNTING CORRELATIONS AND PRACTICAL EXAMPLES FOR MEASURING THE
ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF ACTIVITIES AIMED AT IMPROVING INFORMATION SERVICES ON
TECHNICAL STANDARDS. THE ACCOUNTING CORRELATIONS PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
TECHNICAL-ECONOMIC CALCULATIONS TO MEASURE EFFICIENCY AT ALL MAJOR STAGES OF
SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION.
WIPO STATE-OF-THE-ART SEARCH PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
SINCE SEPT 75, THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION (WIPO) HAS
ORGANISED, FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, A FREE STATE-OF-THE-ART SEARCH PROGRAMME
BASED ON THE USE OF PATENT DOCUMENTS AS A VEHICLE FOR THE TRANSFER OF
TECHNOLOGY. IT STARTED FOLLOWING AN AGREEMENT OF COOPERATION WITH THE AUSTRIAN
GOVERNMENT AND HAS RECENTLY BEEN AUGMENTED BY AGREEMENTS WITH WEST GERMANY,
THE USSR, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND, AND THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE. BY THE END OF
JUNE 80, 839 REQUESTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED, OF WHICH 637 HAD BEEN FINALISED. THE
VOLUME OF REQUESTS IS STEADILY GROWING. DISCUSSES THE MANY DIFFERING FEATURES
OF PATENT DOCUMENTS AND THE TYPES OF SEARCH AVAILABLE IN THE PROGRAMME.
THE COVERAGE OF PATENT DOCUMENTS IN VINITI'S ABSTRACTING JOURNALS.
     
INVESTIGATES THE COVERAGE OF PATENT INFORMATION IN ABSTRACTING JOURNALS
PRODUCED BY VINITI (THE ALL-UNION INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION, USSR) AND EXPLORES THE SUITABILITY OF THE JOURNALS FOR VARIOUS
KINDS OF PATENT RESEARCH. DESCRIBES A TECHNIQUE FOR USING THE JOURNALS FOR
PATENT SEARCHING AND FOR PREPARING SUBJECT COMPILATIONS.

THE US PATENT SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR, THIS REPORT REVEALS THE IDENTITIES OF
MORE THAN 5,000 CORPORATIONS AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS ACTIVE IN US PATENTING,
AND TRACES THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ACTIVITY. THIS PUBLICATION
IDENTIFIES THOSE ORGANISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN 'PATENT ACTIVE', WITH 10 OR
MORE PATENTS TO THEIR CREDIT IN THE LAST 12 YEARS. IT ALSO RANKS THOSE PATENT
RECIPIENTS, I.E. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS, UNIVERSITIES,
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS, IN TERMS OF TOTAL 12-YEAR PATENT
RECEIPTS.
PATENT INFORMATION IN AUSTRALIA.
     
GIVES AN OUTLINE OF PATENT INFORMATION RELATED STUDIES UNDERTAKEN IN AUSTRALIA
AND OF THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN PATENT OFFICE.
PRESIDENT'S REPORT ON 1981' IASSIST-IFDO CONFERENCE.
     
REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT OF IASSIST (INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR SOCIAL
SCIENCE INFORMATION SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY) ON A PLANNING MEETING FOR THE 1981
IASSIST-IFDO CONFERENCE. SUMMARISES AGREEMENTS ON THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
CONFERENCE, ITS CONTENTS, AUDIENCES, AND IASSIST'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
PROBLEMS IN COLLECTING SOCIAL DATA' A REVIEW FOR THE INFORMATION RESEARCHER.
     
DISCUSSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH THE INFORMATION SCIENTIST FACES WHEN
HAVING TO SELECT A PARTICULAR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH STRATEGY. THE
ESTABLISHED MEASUREMENT APPROACH IS DISFAVOURED AS IT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE
ACTUAL SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DATA ARE COLLECTED.
QUALITATIVE METHODS MAY ALSO BE BIASED BY SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRAINS
INHERENT IN THEIR USE. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY REVIEWING THE CASE OF THE
RESEARCH INTERVIEW. 2 POSSIBILITIES ARE OUTLINED WHICH HELP TO INCREASE THE
ADEQUACY OF DATA COLLECTION.
STRUCTURED OBSERVATION IN THE INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION NEEDS.
     
OUTLINES THE REASONS FOR THE CHOICE OF 'STRUCTURED OBSERVATION' AS A RESEARCH
METHOD, DESCRIBES THE TRAINING PROCESS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
DATA-RECORDING FORMAT, THE USE OF STRUCTURED OBSERVATION IN THE FIELD, AND
ASSESSES ITS PROBLEMS AND EFFECTIVENESS.
THE LIBRARIES OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICAL OFFICES IN THE WORLD. COMMENTS ON
THE RESULTS OF AN ENQUIRY. PART 1.
     
AFTER OUTLINING THE HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARIES OF STATISTICAL
OFFICES AND CONSIDERING THEM ONE OF THE EARLIEST TYPES OF SPECIALISED LIBRARY,
THE RESULT OF A COMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL SURVEY IS PRESENTED WHICH WAS
CONDUCTED FOR THE 1ST TIME ON A WORLD-WIDE BASIS AT THE LIBRARIES OF NATIONAL
STATISTICAL OFFICES. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS IS FOLLOWED BY CONCLUSIONS
WITH REGARD TO A FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES
WITH A VIEW TO CREATING A WORLD-WIDE DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL. IN THE LIGHT OF
THESE ACTIVITIES, AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE FIELD OF ATOMIC RESEARCH, SUCH A
CONSIDERATION CAN IN NO WAY BE REGARDED AS AN ILLUSION. THIS SUGGESTION
REPRESENTS AT THE SAME TIME A PARTIAL PROGRAMME FOR FURTHER WORK TO BE
PERFORMED BY THE RELEVANT IFLA SECTION.
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COLLECTION, DISTRIBUTION AND
ANALYSIS OF STATISTICAL DATA.
     
STATISTICAL INFORMATION IS A VITAL NATIONAL RESOURCE, AND A MORE COMPREHENSIVE
EFFORT NEEDS TO BE MADE TO REVIEW AND CONTROL US FEDERAL STATISTICAL POLICY.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTS STATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR REGULATION,
PROGRAMME OPERATION, POLICY ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION PROGRAMMES. STATISTICAL
POLICY MUST BE EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATED INTO LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND
REGULATORY ACTIONS, WITH A STATISTICAL OFFICE REMAINING SEPARATE FROM OTHER
ASPECTS OF INFORMATION POLICY. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF
COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN ITS DISSEMINATION AND USE OF
STATISTICAL DATA, AND PRIVATE FIRMS SHOULD ENGAGE IN ANY AND ALL ANALYSIS
APPROPRIATE FOR THE MARKETS BEING SERVED. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT
ENCROACH UPON ACTIVITIES WHICH PROPERLY BELONG IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO PROBLEMS OF COMPLEXITY' THE DEVELOPMENT OF STATEWIDE
SYSTEMS.
     
INCREASED US GOVERNMENTAL COMPLEXITY AND GROWING DISSATISFACTION WITH
GOVERNMENT ARE 2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS OF CONTEMPORARY US SOCIETY. RESPONSES TO
THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INFORMATION-PROVIDING
AND COMPLAINT-HANDLING AGENCIES IN STATE GOVERNMENT. EXAMINATION OF THESE
STATE AGENCIES INDICATES CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN REASONS FOR ESTABLISHMENT,
ADMINISTRATIVE LOCATION, FUNDING, AND SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES. SUMMARISES A
NUMBER OF THESE DIFFERENCES AND CONSIDERS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AGENCIES FOR
STATE GOVERNMENT.
ACCESS TO DEPARTMENTAL RECORDS, CABINET DOCUMENTS, AND MINISTERIAL PAPERS IN
CANADA.
     
REVIEW OF LEGISLATION RELATING TO ACCESS TO CANADIAN DEPARTMENTAL RECORDS,
CABINET DOCUMENTS AND MINISTERIAL PAPERS, WITH DISCUSSION PARTICULARLY
CENTERING AROUND CABINET DIRECTIVE CD46, INTRODUCED IN JUNE 73, A
PRIVATELY-INTRODUCED BILL, C-225 (1974), AND THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT'S
FREEDOM-OF-INFORMATION BILL (BILL C-15), INTRODUCED ON 24 OCT 79.
ISSUE DEVOTED TO A DEBATE BETWEEN A REGIONAL LIBRARIAN AND A GOVERNMENT
INFORMATION PLANNER, ON LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION).F
     
OR ABSTRACTS OF THE 2 PAPERS IN THIS ISSUE, SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS:.
     
COMMUNITY INFORMATION: THE LIBRARY'S ROLE.
     
(CONTRIBUTION TO A DEBATE ON LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION.) ARGUES
STRONGLY THAT LIBRARIES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN COMMUNITY INFORMATION, BUT THAT
IT IS VERY LIMITED OR DEMANDS SPECIAL SKILLS, A LESS RIGID AND PASSIVE
ATTITUDE TO INFORMATION, AND A LESS INFORMATION-ORIENTED APPROACH TO PEOPLE.
COMMUNITY INFORMATION: THE LIBRARY'S ROLE.
     
(CONTRIBUTION TO A DEBATE ON LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION.) LIBRARIANS
MAKE THE MISTAKE OF SEEING COMMUNITY INFORMATION AS BEING JUST ANOTHER TYPE OF
INFORMATION, AND THEY FALL FOR SOME VERY BASIC FALLACIES: (1) THE ASSUMPTION
THAT OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS THE ONLY VALUABLE INFORMATION; (2) THAT IF A
LITTLE INFORMATION IS GOOD THEN A LOT MUST BE BETTER; (3) THAT OBJECTIVE
INFORMATION CAN BE TRANSMITTED OUT OF CONTEXT; (4) THAT INFORMATION IS ONLY
ACQUIRED THROUGH FORMAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS; (5) THAT INFORMATION IS RELEVANT
TO ALL EVERYDAY NEEDS, WITH AN INFORMATION SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS; (6) THAT
INFORMATION NOT NOW AVAILABLE CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE; AND (7) THAT FUNCTIONAL
UNITS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS CORRESPOND TO THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS OF THE USER.
INFORMATION DISPENSING.
     
DISCUSSES INFORMATION DISPENSING, SEEN AS ONE CATEGORY OF INFORMATION AND
REFERRAL SYSTEMS. DEFINES THE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS BEHIND THIS KIND OF I&R AND
PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW INFORMATION DISPENSING CAN BE USED.
INCORPORATION OF AN OMBUDSMAN MODEL INTO I&R PROGRAMS.
     
EXAMINES THE APPLICABILITY OF AN OMBUDSMAN FUNCTION WITHIN A CONVENTIONAL
INFORMATION AND REFERRAL STRUCTURE. DEFINES AND REVIEWS THE HISTORICAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE OMBUDSMAN CONCEPT, AND INTERFACES THIS CONCEPT WITH THE
REALITIES OF I&R FUNCTIONS, FUNDING AND CLIENT NEEDS.
THE SOCIAL BROKER' A MAJOR ROLE FOR THE BSW TRAINED WORKER.
     
DEFINES THE ROLE OF THE SOCIAL BROKER AND IDENTIFIES IT AS A ROLE PARTICULARLY
SUITED FOR THE BSW GRADUATE WORKING IN AN INFORMATION AND RETRIEVAL SETTING.
THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ATTITUDES NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE BROKERAGE ROLE
ARE PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, SUGGESTS A FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST THE SOCIAL BROKER
ACCOMPLISHING TASKS OF LINKING CLIENTS TO NEEDED TASKS.
I&R. A SOCIAL WORKER'S PERSPECTIVE.
     
DISCUSSES SOME HISTORICAL ASPECTS WHICH HAVE INFLUENCED INFORMATION AND
REFERRAL (I&R) CENTRES ON A CONTEMPORARY BASIS. INDICATES HOW INFORMATION AND
REFERRAL FITS IN WITH THE HUMAN SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND OFFERS SOME
CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF I&R SERVICES OPERATING TODAY. CASEWORK
SKILLS ARE INDICATED AS PLAYING AN INTEGRAL PART IN THE INFORMATION AND
REFERRAL SERVICES AND THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THESE VARIOUS CLASSIFICATIONS.
DISCUSSES THE 80S WITH EMPHASIS ON HOW SOCIAL WORKERS AND LIBRARIANS WILL BE
WORKING TOGETHER.
STATEWIDE INFORMATION AND REFERRAL' A CONCEPTUAL MODEL.
     
DESCRIBES AND ADVOCATES A PERMANENT, FREE-STANDING, GENERIC INFORMATION AND
REFERRAL STATE SYSTEM WHICH WOULD PROVIDE BOTH CENTRALISED DATA COLLECTION AND
DISSEMINATION, AND DECENTRALISED SERVICE DELIVERY. CONTENDS THAT SUCH A SYSTEM
WOULD DECREASE COST WHILE IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS.
INFORMATION AND REFERRAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES' A SURVEY.
     
60 PUBLIC LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE USA ARE OFFERING INFORMATION AND REFERRAL
SERVICES IN VARYING DEGREES FROM TIMID TO AMBITIOUS, 80% USING LIBRARY BUDGETS
FOR SUPPORT. THESE LIBRARIES REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOSE TIES WITH SOCIAL
SERVICE AGENCIES, THE NECESSITY OF PUBLICITY, AND THE IMPERATIVE NEED TO
EVALUATE PRESENT I&R FUNCTIONS.
THE NETWORK CONCEPT IN INFORMATION AND REFERRAL.
     
METHODS OF NETWORKING FOR I&R HAVE BECOME A MAJOR SOURCE OF DEBATE. PRESENTS
DETAILS OF THE PORTLAND, OREGON, NETWORKING MODEL. SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS
CONCERNING PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND TEAMWORK ARE RAISED IN THE CONCLUSIONS.
I&R SERVICES: A MANIFESTATION OF AND RESPONSE TO POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY.
     
ANALYSES THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICES AS
BOTH A MANIFESTATION OF AND RESPONSE TO THE SERVICES PHENOMENA OF
POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. THE IMPORTANCE OF SERVICES AND INFORMATION EPITOMISED
BY I&R SERVICES IS CITED AS DISTINGUISHING POST-INDUSTRIAL FROM EARLIER
SOCIETIES. THUS, INFORMATION MECHANISMS SUCH AS I&R SERVICES ARE NECESSARY TO
ASSIST INDIVIDUALS IN IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING SERVICES APPROPRIATE TO THEIR
NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE MARKETING OF AN INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICE.
     
EXAMINES MARKETING STRATEGY AND REVIEWS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOCIAL SERVICE
ADVERTISING. DESCRIBES AND EVALUATES A MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOR AN I&R SERVICE,
CONCLUDING THAT PAID ADVERTISING WAS COST EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING UTILISATION
OF THE I&R.
MODERN ASPECTS OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION IN EDUCATION.
     
PRESENTS A MODEL OF AN INFORMATION COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN EDUCATION
CONSISTING OF 2 SUBSYSTEMS' (A) THE SUBSYSTEM OF DIDACTIC INFORMATION
PROCESSING AND THE RESULTS OF THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH WORK IN
THE AREA OF EDUCATION; AND (B) THE SUBSYSTEM OF NUMERICAL DATA (DATA BANKS) AS
A NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR MANAGING STAFF IN EDUCATION, WHICH
SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES STATISTICAL DATA CONCERNING THE PROGRESS OF THIS
ACTIVITY. A DESCRIPTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW WITHIN THE 2 SUBSYSTEMS IS
MADE AND SEVERAL EVALUATION CRITERIA OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY ARE
GIVEN.
INFORMATION SEARCH SERVICES FOR EDUCATORS.
     
BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED PRIMARILY BY 2 EXISTING STATE-BASED INFORMATION
SERVICES, THIS HANDBOOK PRESENTS A CLEAR, PRACTICAL LOOK AT POSSIBLE

MADE SUBMISSIONS; THE DOCUMENT WAS RELEASED ON THE FRIDAY OF A HOLIDAY WEEKEND
(5 FEB 81); COPIES WERE NOT SENT TO DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES FOR OVER A MONTH; AND
THE LIMITED STOCKS WERE SOON SOLD OUT. THE NEW ZEALAND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
STANDING EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS SAID THAT THE COMMISSION HAS NOT REALLY
TACKLED ITS TERM OF REFERENCE CONCERNING 'THE EXTENT TO WHICH OFFICIAL
INFORMATION CAN BE MADE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC', THE KEY AREA OF
LIBRARY CONCERN. RELEASE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TO THE NEWS MEDIA DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION; SPEEDY ACCESS IN LIBRARIES
(WITHOUT HOLD-UPS FOR TIME-CONSUMING CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFYING), DOES.
STAGES IN ESTABLISHING INFORMATION ACTIVITY.
     
IDENTIFIES THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF INFORMATION ACTIVITY AS ISSUE,
NOTIFICATION, SERVICE, AND PROVISION OF INFORMATION. EMPHASISES THE NECESSITY

THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE AS SHOWN BY A LARGE-SCALE CITATION
ANALYSIS.
     
TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY SERVICES, AN
ANALYSIS OF 59,000 CITATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS CONDUCTED-11,000 TAKEN
FROM 300 MONOGRAPHS, AND 48,000 FROM 140 SERIALS, INCLUDING 47 HIGHLY CITED
TITLES AND 47 TAKEN AT RANDOM. LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT BETWEEN
ANALYSES OF REFERENES TAKEN FROM SERIALS AND THOSE FROM MONOGRAPHS, AND
SMALLER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANALYSES OF REFERENCES FROM HIGHLY CITED AND
RANDOMLY CHOSEN SERIALS. THERE WERE ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBJECTS;
MOST OF THESE DIFFERENES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLANNING OF SECONDARY
SERVICES. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE
DEFICIENT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF MATERIAL THEY COVER, IN THE NUMBER AND
POSSIBLY THE SELECTION OF SERIALS COVERED, IN THE SUBJECT SPREAD OF MATERIAL
OF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE, AND PROBABLY ALSO OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND
MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.

METALLURGY, PHYSICS1 (USSR), 2METALS ABSTRACTS, PHYSICS ABSTRACTS1 (UK) AND
2INTERNATIONAL AEROSPACE ABSTRACTS1 (USA). THE RESULTS WERE USED TO DETERMINE
THE FLOW CHARACTERISTICS OF JOURNALS (AND ARTICLES) AND THE SUBJECT STRUCTURE
OF ARTICLES THE ABSTRACTS OF WHICH APPEARED IN ALL THE MENTIONED ABSTRACT
JOURNALS. MULTIPLE ENTRIES OF ABSTRACTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AN INDICATION OF
THE INFORMATION VALUE OF THE ABSTRACTED ARTICLES.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF THE ABSTRACT JOURNALS ON AGRICULTURE AND SOME WAYS
TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY.
     
INVESTIGATES THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY PARAMETERS FOR THE FLOW OF DOCUMENTARY
INFORMATION ON SUGAR BEET. IT IS FOUND THAT IN 62.5% OF CASES, THE 2 VINITI
AND VNIITEISKH ABSTRACTING JOURNALS IN THIS FIELD COVER THE SAME MATERIAL. TO
MINIMISE SUCH DUPLICATION AND TO MAXIMISE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS, VINITI
AND VNIITEISKH MUST COORDINATE THEIR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.

ANALYSED.
PRIVATIZATION' A NEW ARRANGEMENT FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
     
LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS, CONFRONTED WITH THE REALITIES OF MANAGING WITH LESS,
SHOULD CONSIDER PRIVATISATION AS A COST-CUTTING ARRANGEMENT FOR THE DELIVERY
OF LIBRARY SERVICES. MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING WHICH SEPARATES THE ROLES OF
PROVIDER AND PRODUCER OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING COSTS THROUGH
COMPETITIVE BIDDING BY PRIVATE FIRMS OFFERING TO PRODUCE LIBRARY SERVICES.

FEBRUARY 1980, (WHICH DISCUSSES MEETINGS HELD BY THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN
STATES TO REVIEW A NUMBER OF MULTI-NATIONAL PROJECTS IN THE FIELD OF LIBRARY
AUTOMATION, RELATED TO THE USE OF THE MARCAL (LATIN AMERICAN MARC) FORMAT;
WHAT IS LIBRUNAM? (AN INTEGRAL SYSTEM FOR THE INPUT, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL
OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION MAINLY RELATING TO BOOKS, DEVELOPED BY THE
DIRECCION GENERAL DE BIBLIOTECAS OF THE UNIVERSIDAD NACHINAL AUTONOMA DE
MEXICO); AND BIBLIOGRAFIA MEXICANA AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO LIBRARY CATALOGUING
PROCESSES, BY GLORIA ESCAMILLA.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON ON-LINE TECHNOLOGY. DISCUSSES THE
AUTOMATED PERIODICALS-CONTROL SYSTEM (PEKOS), WHICH FORMS PART OF THE
INTEGRATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT THE ETH-BIBLIOTHEK, ZURICH. AT
PRESENT PEKOS CONTROLS THE 8,000 CURRENT PERIODICALS UNTIL STORAGE OF
COMPLETED VOLUMES; IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXTENDED TO THE ENTIRE PERIODICALS
HOLDINGS. EXPLAINS HOW ACCESS TO THE DATA FILES CAN BE OBTAINED BY EITHER
TITLE OR CALL NUMBER. DESCRIBES HOW PEKOS CAN BE USED FOR REGISTRATION OF
INCOMING ISSUES; PRINTOUT OF CLAIMS; BINDING AND STORAGE HANDLING; CALL-NUMBER
IDENTIFICATION; AND THE ANSWERING OF ENQUIRIES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS.

LIBRARY REFERENCE WORK. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE MAJOR EFFECTS OF ON-LINE SOURCES
ON THE ACQUISITION OF REFERENCE MATERIALS, INCLUDING COST-EFFECTS OF
SUBSTITUTING ON-LINE EQUIVALENTS FOR PRINTED REFERENCE WORKS.
THE ACM PERIODICAL BANK' A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW.
     
EVALUATION OF A COOPERATIVE VENTURE PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT IN THE LATE 60S
AND 70S BY 10 MID-WEST LIBERAL ART COLLEGES. THEIR LIBRARY SERVICE AND CENTRAL
PERIODICAL BANK WORKED WELL UNTIL IT WAS COOPTED BY THE TAX-SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
IN MINNESOTA AND LATER SOLD TO THE ILLINOIS NORTH SUBURBAN LIBRARY SYSTEM,
WHICH SERVES A MUCH LARGER CLIENTELE AND COULD THUS PROVIDE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
BASED ON HIGH-VOLUME BORROWING AND LARGE COLLECTIONS.
AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS' KEYNOTE ADDRESS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OF
THE RAPID PROGRESS BEING MADE TOWARD INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND MAKE THE
ACQUISITIONS AUTOMATION DECISION IN THAT LIGHT. CONTRASTS THE MID-60S AND
EARLY 80S IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARY NEEDS. IN THE MID-60S, EMPHASIS
WAS ON ORDERING, AND TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITING BOTH IN TERMS OF COSTS AND
CAPABILITIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 80S LIBRARIES HAVE NUMEROUS ACQUISITIONS
AVAILABLE, INCLUDING TURNKEY SYSTEMS FROM SOME CIRCULATION SYSTEM VENDORS AND
THE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. IT IS UNLIKELY
THAT A SINGLE SOURCE WILL OFFER A LIBRARY THE MOST SUITABLE FEATURES FOR EACH
FUNCTION, AND THE PROBLEM BECOMES ONE OF INTEGRATING SYSTEMS FROM SEVERAL
SOURCES.
LOCAL SYSTEMS' DESIGN AND COSTS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. A LOCAL APPROACH TO THE
AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONS PROCESSES WAS, UNTIL COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY, THE
ONLY ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE. GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN PROCESS ARE WELL
DOCUMENTED; COSTS ARE NOT. INVESTIGATES PITFALLS TO A LOCAL APPROACH AND LISTS
ALTERNATIVES. EXPLORES TRENDS SUCH AS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF INTERFACE
WITH NATIONAL OR OTHER LOCAL SYSTEMS, AND THE GREATER DEMANDS FOR MANAGERIAL
DATA. SUGGESTS THAT A LESS RIGID, TRADITIONAL APPROACH TOWARDS AUTOMATING
ACQUISITIONS FUNCTIONS MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE, AND THAT A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES SHOULD PRECEDE A DECISION TO ADOPT OR
MAINTAIN A TOTALLY LOCAL APPROACH.
ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE LITA INSTITUTE-PART 1).T
     
HE INSTITUTE WAS PRESENTED TWICE, IN DEC 79 AT NASHVILLE, TENESSEE AND IN MAY
80 AT VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA. EACH SESSION WAS 2 DAYS LONG, AND TOGETHER
THE 2 ATTRACTED A TOTAL OF 332 PARTICIPANTS. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS
PRESENTED, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'-.
THE ROLE OF THE NETWORK IN AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. EXAMINES NON-PROFIT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS TO ASSESS WHY THEY OFFER, OR PLAN TO OFFER ACQUISITIONS
SERVICES, WHAT MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS THEY CAN MAKE, AND THE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF NETWORK ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.
NETWORKS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITIONS
FUNCTIONS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND THE NETWORKS CAN PROVIDE BOTH ACQUISITIONS
AND IN-PROCESS CONTROL OVER MATERIALS, THUS ALLOWING A LIBRARY TO OPERATE MORE
EFFICIENTLY WITH IMPROVED INTERNAL CONTROLS. AS A NETWORK SYSTEM WILL DISPLAY
MEMBER HOLDINGS, COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONS AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN WILL ALSO BE
FACILITATED.
VENDOR SYSTEMS AND ON-LINE ORDERING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED LIBRARY ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS, WITH EMPHASIS ON
VENDOR-DEVELOPED SYSTEMS, IS GIVEN FROM THE 1960S TO 1980. DEFINITIONS FOR
ON-LINE ORDERING SYSTEMS AND ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS ARE DEVELOPED. DESCRIBES AN
'IDEAL' ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM; THE MODEL DEVELOPED IS NOT YET FULLY
AVAILABLE. PRESENTS A STRATEGY FOR SELECTING THE BEST SYSTEM FOR A PARTICULAR
LIBRARY, AND MAKES PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY ACQUISITIONS FROM
1980-84.

IDENTIFY THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS OF THESE JURISDICTIONS. SEVERAL VALUABLE
RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE CITED. CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE
VARIES IN QUALITY. BOTH REGIONAL AND LOCAL LISTS ARE CITED, SOME OF WHICH ARE
LOCALLY PRODUCED WHILE OTHERS REFLECT ACQUISITIONS OF MAJOR CARIBBEAN
COLLECTIONS IN BRITISH AND NORTH AMERICAN LIBRARIES.
JOURNAL ACQUISITION AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS IN A SPECIAL LIBRARY' A CASE STUDY.
     
BROOKES' MODEL, BASED ON TRADITIONAL BRADFORD'S APPROACH, AS A QUANTIFICATION
METHOD, HAS SOME LOOPHOLES WHICH CAN BE OVERCOME BY RANKING JOURNALS
CONSIDERING BOTH PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSCRIPTION COST. THIS PAPER REPORTS SUCH A
STUDY. THE MAJOR FINDINGS ARE 1) THIS METHOD IS A FURTHER IMPROVEMENT AND
RATIONALISATION OF BROOKES' METHOD AND TRADITIONAL BRADFORD'S APPROACH. 2)
THERE IS A STEADY DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF RUPEE IN TERMS OF YIELD OF RELEVANT
PAPERS AND THUS JOURNAL ACQUISITION REACHES THE POINT OF DIMINISHING RETURNS
AT A CERTAIN STAGE. 3) THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE 2 RANKED
LISTS.

PROCEDURES, AND INTERDEPARTMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS. CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION,
RETENTION, OR REMOVAL OF REFERENCE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SELECTION OF SECONDARY INFORMATION SERVICES.
     
THE CRITERION BASED ON S.R. RANGANATHAN'S FIVE LAWS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE TO
SELECT THE MOST APPROPRIATE SECONDARY SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR A PARTICULAR
ENVIRONMENT OF INFORMATION USERS IS DISCUSSED.
BOOK REVIEWS AS AIDS TO BOOK SELECTION.
     
A SMALL SURVEY HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT LEICESTER UNIVERSITY TO FIND OUT WHAT
SOURCES OF INFORMATION ACADEMICS IN SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS USE WHEN SELECTING
BOOKS FOR PURCHASING BY THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. INFORMATION WAS PARTICULARLY
REQUIRED ABOUT THE ROLE OF BOOK REVIEWS. WHILE RARELY GIVING FIRST INFORMATION
ABOUT A BOOK SUITABLE FOR PURCHASE, BOOK REVIEWS ARE READ REGULARLY BY A 1/3
OF THE STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY.

LATEST IN A SERIES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON INTERLENDING, COVERING MATERIAL FROM
1978. TRANSLATIONS ARE PROVIDED FOR NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE TITLES. ALL ITEMS ARE
TAKEN FROM RELEVANT SECONDARY SERVICES AND LIBRARY JOURNALS.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING' A SOUTH-EAST ASIAN PERSPECTIVE.
     
EDITED VERSION OF A PAPER GIVEN TO THE IFLA SECTION ON INTERLENDING AT THE
IFLA GENERAL CONFERENCE, MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES, AUG 80. SURVEYS INTERLENDING
IN THE COUNTRIES WHICH COMPRISE THE CONSORTIUM OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES AND
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES, SOUTH-EAST ASIA-INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES,
SINGAPORE AND THAILAND. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY REVEALED THAT THE VOLUME OF
INTERLENDING VARIED GREATLY BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES AND WAS GENERALLY LOW.
MANY MORE INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS WERE SENT ABROAD THAN WERE RECEIVED. ONLY
A FEW LIBRARIES HAD TELEPHONE AND TELEX LINKS, BUT MANY HAD REPROGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT. REQUESTS WERE SENT MAINLY TO SUBJECT SPECIALIST LIBRARIES, AND
UNION CATALOGUES AND CENTRAL COLLECTIONS WERE LESS USED. CHARGES WERE MINIMAL.
STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS.
THIS IS 1 FUNCTION OF NATIONAL INTERLENDING CENTRES, WHICH SHOULD BE
ESTABLISHED AS INDEPENDENT UNITS IN ALL COUN TRIES.
COMPUTER NETWORKS SYSTEMS' THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CO-OPERATIVE
INTERLENDING IN THE USA.
     
REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL
DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. RECENT US DEVELOPMENTS HAVE
FAVOURED DECENTRALISED NETWORKS RATHER THAN CENTRALISED RESOURCE LIBRARIES. US
LIBRARIES LACK CENTRAL PLANNING AND FUNDING, AND PROGRESS DEPENDS ON
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY INITIATIVES. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS THIS HAS RESULTED IN
OCLC, RLG, WLN AND 20 REGIONAL NETWORKS. DESCRIBES THE 3 MAJOR COMPUTER
COMPUTER UTILITIES. THESE COMPUTER NETWORKS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTED NOT
DUPLICATED BY CENTRAL RESOURCE LIBRARIES; WITH THE NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTER
EFFECTIVELY SHELVED, THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES COULD ASSUME A MORE
DYNAMIC ROLE. COMMERCIAL VENDORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT ARE AN IMPORTANT
ELEMENT IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE CONVENTIONAL
LIBRARY SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT CREAM OFF THE PROFITABLE END OF THE DOCUMENT SUPPLY
MARKET .
SERIALS INVENTORY: A CASE STUDY.
     
A SERIALS UNIVERSITY PROJECT OF OVER 400,000 VOLUMES WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE
TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THE INVENTORY PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED.
STATISTICS FROM THE INVENTORY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM OVER
EXPENSIVE SERIAL VOLUMES DISAPPEARING FROM LIBRARY SHELVES. THE SUCCESSFUL
COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT SHOWS THAT AN INVENTORY OF A LARGE SERIALS
COLLECTION REMAINS A SOUND METHOD IN MANAGING SERIALS COLLECTIONS.
PUBLIC WELFARE CASE RECORDS' A STUDY OF ARCHIVAL PRACTICES.
     
THE US FEDERAL-STATE WELFARE SYSTEM, ESTABLISHED BY THE 1935 SOCIAL SECURITY
ACT, HAS GENERATED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL CASE FILES ON WELFARE
APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS, WHICH ARE OF GREAT HISTORICAL VALUE. IN 1978 A
QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO ALL STATE ARCHIVISTS TO IDENTIFY CURRENT PRACTICES
AND PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED REGARDING THE ACCESSIONING OF PUBLIC
WELFARE CASE RECORDS. THE STUDY WAS RESTRICTED TO FEDERAL-STATE CATEGORICAL
INCOME MAINTENANCE PROGRAMMES. A 92% RESPONSE RATE YIELDED DATA ON THE VALUE
OF CASE RECORDS AS RESEARCH MATERIALS, WHETHER OR NOT STATE ARCHIVES ACCESSION
PUBLIC WELFARE CASE RECORDS, PRIMARY PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE RECORDS, AND
POSSIBLE PRACTICABLE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS.
THE CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL
CONDITIONS' THE PROBLEMS OF THE INCREASED DANGERS OF DAMAGE AND DECAY IN AREAS
OF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY.
     
THE GENERAL POINT IS STRESSED THAT LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND
SUB-TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME DANGERS AS THOSE IN MODERATE
CLIMATE ZONES; BUT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THESE DANGERS ARE INCREASED,
SOME OF THEM DRAMATICALLY, IN WARM DAMP CLIMATES. IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL
CLIMATES THERE IS THE THREAT OF DAMAGE BY INSECTS OF A NATURE AND TO AN EXTENT
THAT IS UNKNOWN IN MODERATE CLIMATE ZONES AND FINALLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO
CHANGE THIS SITUATION FUNDAMENTALLY BY ANY CONSERVATION OR RESTORATION
MEASURES, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT AN EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC IN
PRESENT TERMS OF MANPOWER AND ENERGY.
BOOK PRESERVATION QUESTIONS ANSWERED AT CONFERENCE.
     
REPORT ON THE FINDINGS OF A CONFERENCE, ON BOOK PRESERVATION SPONSORED BY THE
COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES AND THE ANDREW MELLON FOUNDATION. THE NEED FOR
FURTHER PROGRESS WAS EMPHASISED, AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THERE WAS A FOUNDATION
ON WHICH TO BUILD. THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS REASONABLE
TO BALANCE THE PHYSICAL DURABILITY OF BOOKS AND THEIR INTELLECTUAL AND
CULTURAL WORTH. DISCUSSION TOPICS INCLUDED PERMANENCE AND DURABILITY OF PAPER,
ITS AVAILABILITY AND COSTS, CATEGORIES OF BOOKS AND JOURNALS TO BE ROUTINELY
MANUFACTURED ON PERMANENT AND DURABLE PAPER, PROMOTION OF ALKALINE AND DURABLE
PAPERS OUTSIDE THE US, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MANUFACTURING COPIES OF BOOKS
FOR LIBRARIES SEPARATELY.
ON PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY HOLDINGS. THE STATE POLICY IN THE FIELD OF LIBRARY
COLLECTION CONSERVATION IN THE USSR.
     
REPORT OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF SOVIET LIBRARY COLLECTION CONSERVATION
PRESENTED BY N.S. KARTASHOV DURING THE 46TH IFLA GENERAL CONFERENCE, MANILA,
PHILIPPINES, 18-23 AUG 80. RESEARCH AND PRACTICAL WORK ON PRESERVATION AND
RESTORATION ARE BEING CONDUCTED IN LIBRARIES, LABORATORIES, AND AT THE
ALL-UNION RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF RESTORATION. METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES COORDINATE
ACTIVITIES AND TRAINING WITHIN EACH SOVIET DEPARTMENT. RESTORERS ARE BEING
TRAINED AND AIDS AND MANUALS ARE BEING PRODUCED. ALL RESTORATION ACTIVITIES
ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF RESTORATION BOARDS.
FIRST, DO NO HARM' GIVING ADVICE ABOUT PHOTO-CONSERVATION.
     
IN 1979 IN THE USA, OVER 10 BILLION EXPOSURES WERE MADE BY 45 BILLION CAMERAS,
BUT MOST OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOST, THROWN AWAY,
SELF-DESTRUCT OR BE FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANYONE EVEN THINKS OF PRESERVING THEM FOR
POSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SO
PERHAPS PRESERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS' ORIGINATORS. ONLY
NOW IS SOME EFFORT BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMES FOR THE FORMAL TRAINING
OF CONSERVATORS, AND MOST AMATEURS STILL WANT CHEAP, QUICK AND EASY SOLUTIONS.
IT FALLS TO LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS, THEREFORE TO MAKE USEFUL
INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT AND TO BE PREPARED TO
CARRY IT TO THOSE WHO DO NOT. PRESENTS A LIST OF USEFUL AND RECENT SOURCE
MATERIALS ON PHOTO-CONSERVATION. IF PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE RAISED ENOUGH
TO SEEK AND FOLLOW THE ADVICE GIVEN BY PROFESSIONALS, MUCH OF THE USA'S
PHOTOGRAPHIC HERITAGE CAN BE S AVED.
STORABILITY OF FILM SOUND RECORDS.
     
THE EXPEDIENCE OF STORING THE SOUND ACCOMPANIMENT OF MOTION PICTURE FILM ON
35-MM MAGNETIC TAPE IS DISCUSSED. THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY OF SOUND RECORDS
STORAGE IN FILM LIBRARIES IS DESCRIBED AND TRENDS IN ITS DEVELOPMENT ARE
CONSIDERED.
AMERICAN ARCHITECTURAL RECORDS' CREATING ORDER AND ORGANIZATION.
     
AN ACCOUNT OF THE INITIATIVES TAKEN BY A SMALL GROUP IN THE USA TO LOCATE AND
RECORD THE NATION'S ARCHITECTURAL RECORDS; THE FORMATION OF AN
INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF ARCHITECTURAL RECORDS IN
1973 IN NEW YORK; THE COMMITTEE'S LOCAL ACTIVITIES AND, DUE TO GOVERNMENT
SPONSORSHIP, NATIONAL GROWTH; THE COMMITTEE'S SURVEY METHODS AND RECORDING
TECHNIQUES; AND THE FORMATION AND ROLE OF THE NATIONAL CATALOG OF AMERICAN
ARCHITECTURAL RECORDS.
FUNGAL ATTACK ON BOOKS' A REPORT.
     
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF VARIOUS METHODS OF CONTROL OF FUNGUS ATTACK ON
BOOKS ARE DESCRIBED. RESULTS OF THYMOL STERILISATION TRIED DURING 1976 MONSOON
PERIOD IN THE INSTITUTE OF ARMAMENT TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY ARE PRESENTED. IT HAS
BEEN INFERRED THAT PROPER DESIGN OF THE LIBRARY BUILDING AND GOOD VENTILATION,
AREA STERILISATION WITH 10% THYMOL IN METHYL ALCOHOL AT INTERVALS OF 20 DAYS
DURING MONSOON CHECKS THE GROWTH OF FUNGUS.
MICROBIODETERIORATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS. PART 1, CHAPTERS 1-3.
     
CHAPTER 1 SURVEYS LITERATURE ON THE MICROBIAL DETERIORATION OF LIBRARY AND
ARCHIVE MATERIALS. CHAPTER 2 DESCRIBES GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS
MICROORGANISMS CAUSING THIS DETERIORATION-BACTERIA, ACTINOMYCETES, FUNGI,
YEASTS, AND ALGAE. CHAPTER 3 DEALS WITH THE CAUSES OF MICROBIOCORROSION OF
MATERIAL BY THE METABOLIC PRODUCTS OF MICROORGANISMS AND THE PROTECTION OF
SUCH MATERIAL BY BACTERI-, FUNGI-, AND ALGICIDES. PART 2 (CHAPTERS 4-5) AND
PART 3 (CHAPTERS 6-9) WILL BE PUBLISHED IN LATER ISSUES.
DISINFECTION AND STRAIGHTENING OF PARCHMENT DAMAGED BY MICROORGANISMS.
     
BACTERIA AND MICELLAR FUNGI WERE ISOLATED FROM DAMAGED PARTS OF ANCIENT
MANUSCRIPTS ON PARCHMENT AND INVESTIGATED. CATAMIN AB (ALREADY USED AS A
DISINFECTANT FOR PAINTINGS) WAS FOUND TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ANTISEPTIC
AGENT AGAINST THESE PARCHMENT-DESTROYING MICROORGANISMS AND A DISINFECTING
TECHNIQUE INCORPORATING THE STRAIGHTENING OF DEFORMED PARCHMENTS WAS
DEVELOPED. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT CATAMIN AB HAS NO DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON THE
PHYSICO-MECHANICAL AND PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF PARCHMENT.
PRESENT STATE OF AND WAYS OF FURTHER IMPROVING REFERENCE ARCHIVES.
     
MENTIONS ADVANCES IN THE REFERENCE (R) OF THE SOVIET STATE SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AND THE REGULARITY OF INCREASES IN INFORMATION
FLOW. DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATE AND EXCESSIVE
INFORMATION, THE NEED FOR COORDINATION, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF DOCUMENT FLOW.
DESCRIBES THE TASKS, STRUCTURE, AND FUNCTIONS OF THE CENTRAL R AND SUBSYSTEMS
OF A BRANCH INFORMATION SYSTEM AND INDICATES THE RESOURCES WHICH A BRANCH R
SHOULD CONTAIN. DISCUSSES DRAWBACKS IN FILE COMPLETION AND IDENTIFIES WAYS OF
INCREASING R EFFECTIVENESS.
TO GROW OR NOT TO GROW?.
     
ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THE
FLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BE
STUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES
TO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;
ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARE
CITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.
THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE
SPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVER
USED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TO
REDUCE FUTURE SPACE PRESSURES.
PLESSEY LAUNCH MODULE 4.
     
PLESSEY'S MODULE 4 IS A COMPLETELY NEW REAL TIME LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
BOTH IN TERMS OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. IT USES A MINICOMPUTER WITH 2X300
MEGABYTE DISC DRIVES WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE A DATA BASE OF OVER 2 MILLION
ITEMS. 2 NEW TERMINALS, A MICROPROCESSOR CONTROLLED CIRCULATION TERMINAL AND
AN ENQUIRY VDU, HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. DESCRIBES THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM, AND
BOOK AND BORROWER QUERIES.
CONCEPT OF A COMPUTER-SUPPORTED METHOD FOR STACK AND OPEN-ACCESS LENDING.
     
DESCRIPTION OF AN ON-LINE LOAN SYSTEM DEVELOPED FOR POSSIBLE APPLICATION AT
THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MUNSTER. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO HARDWARE
AND SOFTWARE, BOOK AND READER IDENTIFIERS, AND DATA CARRIERS. THE NECESSARY
ROUTINES ARE ITEMISED, AND LIKELY COSTS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

INFORMATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE MICROFILMING OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
DATA IN THE SOVIET STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
CONSIDERS METHODS AND MEANS OF COLOUR MICROFILMING ON MULTILAYER MATERIALS,
POSSIBILITIES OF SPECTRUM AND ZONE PHOTOGRAPHY, ADDITIVE COLOUR PICTURE
SYNTHESISERS, HOLOGRAPHY, LIPPMANN PHOTOGRAPHY, AND PHOTOGRAPHY WITH CARRIER
FREQUENCY. BLACK-AND-WHITE AND COLOUR MICROFILMING SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY CAN BE
ATTAINED WHEN USING SPECTRUM AND ZONE METHODS. THIS IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST
FOR THOSE SERVICES IN WHICH A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL BEING
MICROFILMED IS IN COLOUR.

THE RESULTS OF A CATALOGUING IN PUBLICATION EXPERIMENT.
     
ON 1 SEPT 80, THE ROYAL LIBRARY OF THE NETHERLANDS AND THE ISBN BUREAU OF THE
DUTCH CENTRAL BOOKHOUSE BEGAN A 6-MONTH STUDY OF CATALOGUING-IN-PUBLICATION. A
CIP OFFICE WAS CREATED IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY, TO WHICH 19 PUBLISHERS AGREED TO
SUBMIT DETAILS OF NEW BOOKS IN PREPARATION. FROM INFORMATION SUPPLIED
CATALOGUE ENTRIES WERE PREPARED AND FORWARDED TO THE PUBLISHERS FOR INCLUSION
IN THE APPROPRIATE BOOKS. AT THE END OF THE STUDY A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS
CIRCULATED TO THE PUBLISHERS WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE SCHEME, TOGETHER WITH
21 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND 26 BOOKSELLERS IN THE NETHERLANDS. ALMOST ALL
CONCERNED FELT THAT THE EXPERIMENT HAD BEEN A SUCCESS. HOWEVER, THE EXPERIENCE
OF CIP BUREAU STAFF SHOWED THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT
BETWEEN PUBLISHERS AND THE BUREAU.

INITIATIVES.
NON-ROMAN RECORDS AND AUTOMATED CATALOGUING.
     
PAPER PRESENTED TO THE ASIAN CATALOGUING WORKSHOP, 20TH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE,
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA, CANBERRA, AUG 79. INCREASINGLY, NORTH
AMERICAN LIBRARIES IN GENERAL AND CANADIAN LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR ARE TURNING
TO AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES TO SUPPORT THEIR CATALOGUING EFFORTS.
DISCUSSES THE VARIED AND UNSETTLED SITUATION REGARDING THE RELATION OF THESE
LIBRARIES' BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR NON-ROMAN MATERIALS TO THIS AUTOMATION
EFFORT.
SOME QUESTIONS ON DEALING WITH SPECIAL DOCUMENTS.
     
THE CURRENT CZECHOSLOVAK STANDARD CSN 01 0195 (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND CATALOGUING
RECORD) DOES NOT CONTAIN AN EXHAUSTIVE DESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS, BUT A
REWORKING OF THIS STANDARD IS PLANNED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THUS, A MORE
DETAILED GUIDANCE MUST BE SOUGHT IN VARIOUS CATALOGUING DIRECTIVES PUBLISHED
BETWEEN 1969 AND 71, WHICH GIVE A GOOD DESCRIPTION AND NUMEROUS PRACTICAL
EXAMPLES. SPECIAL MATERIALS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED ARE SHEET MUSIC AND RECORDS,
PATENTS AND STANDARDS, GRAPHICS AND AUDIOVISUALS, ARCHIVE MATERIAL AND
DOCUMENTS. RATIONAL APPROACH TO WORK WITH SPECIAL DOCUMENTS INCLUDES GROUP
CATALOGUING AND MACHINE PROCESSING, ESPECIALLY OF TECHNICAL MATERIAL.
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES SHOULD EXTABLISH WHICH MATERIALS CAUSE LIBRARIES THE
MOST PROBLEMS AND DEVISE WAYS OF SOLVING THEM.
THE COMPUTERIZATION PROJECT OF THE NATAL PROVINCIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM
SERVICES' CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE STAFF OF THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND THE COMPUTER
BUREAU OF THE ADMINISTRATION. PART 1.
     
IN 1974 THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATAL PROVINCIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM SERVICES
DIVISION REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO COMPUTERISATION OF THE PROVINCIAL
LIBRARY CATALOGUE. A FEASIBILITY STUDY RECOMMENDED THE DEVELOPMENT AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF A LIBRARY CATALOGUE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM ENTAILING THE USE OF
A MARC LIBRARY SOFTWARE PACKAGE, ITS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT TO CATER FOR BOOK
ORDERING AND PREPARATION, AND A FURTHER STUDY OF THE USE OF COM AS A MEDIUM
FOR THE CATALOGUE. DESCRIBES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND
PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED.
THE DARTMOUTH CATALOGUE SYSTEM-FIVE YEARS LATER.
     
DARTMOUTH REGIONAL LIBRARY (NOVA SCOTIA) HAS BEEN RUNNING A COMPUTERISED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR 5 YEARS. IT CONTAINS OVER 80,000 RECORDS PERTAINING TO
PRINTED, AUDIO-VISUAL, AND MICRO-FORMAT MATERIAL. CUMULATIVE CURRENT
ACQUISITIONS CATALOGUES ARE PRODUCED 8 TIMES A YEAR. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR,
THESE ARE MERGED WITH THE MASTER FILES AND A NEW COMPLETE CATALOGUE IS
PRODUCED. THE SYSTEM COSTS ARE 13 CENTS PER TITLE ADDED (THIS INCLUDES
EDITING, UPDATE, AND MAINTENANCE, BUT NOT INPUT CHARGES). THE SYSTEM HAS
PROVED VERY SUCCESSFUL AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND
EFFICIENCY ARE PLANNED.
THE AUTOMATED AUTHORITY FILE AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CANADA.
     
OUTLINES THE NEED FOR AUTHORITY FILES' DESPITE THE USE OF COMPATIBLE MARC
FORMATS AND CATALOGUING RULES, AND OF COMPLEX CODING, FURTHER STANDARDISATION
IS NEEDED TO ACCURATELY ENSURE THE COLLECTION FUNCTION IN A LARGE FILE, BUT
WHICH PERMITS FLEXIBILITY IN LOCAL USAGE AND IN CATALOGUING PRODUCTS.
DESCRIBES' THE BACKGROUND OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CANADA AUTHORITY
SUBSYSTEM; THE BATCH-MODE AUTHORITY SUBSYSTEM CURRENTLY IN OPERATION;

DESIGNING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUE USING COBOL.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED AT BHEL, DELHI LIBRARY WITH
E.C. 1020 USING COBOL LANGUAGE FOR CREATING A MACHINE READABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA BASE.
OCLC SEARCH KEY USAGE IN A LARGE RESEARCH LIBRARY.
     
MANY LIBRARIES USE THE OCLC ONLINE UNION CATALOG AND SHARED CATALOGING
SUBSYSTEM TO PERFORM VARIOUS LIBRARY FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS AND
CATALOGUING. AS AN INITIAL PART OF THE OPERATION, USERS MUST SEARCH AND
RETRIEVE A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD FOR AN ITEM FROM THE LARGE OCLC DATA BASE.
VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVED SEARCH KEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR RETRIEVAL. THIS STUDY OF
ACTUAL SEARCH KEYS ENTERED BY ON-LINE USERS OF OCLC WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE
THE TYPES OF SEARCH KEY USERS PREFER FOR PERFORMING VARIOUS LIBRARY OPERATIONS
AND TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE PREFERRED SEARCH KEYS ARE EFFECTIVE.
ON THE CITATION OF PATENTS' A NEW STANDARD.
     
THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED GERMAN STANDARD DIN 1505, PART 2 DRAFT APRIL 1981
SHORTENED BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES (RULES FOR CITING DOCUMENTS) GIVES RULES
FOR FORM AND CONTENTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES. THE MAIN SECTIONS OF THE
STANDARD ARE LISTED, THEN THE TEXT OF THE SECTIONS DEALING WITH INDUSTRIAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS IS GIVEN IN ENGLISH AND IN THE ORIGINAL GERMAN VERSION. THERE
ARE COMMENTS TO THE DETAILS OF THIS SECTION.
A USER STUDY OF PUBLIC CATALOGS' A QUEUING APPROACH.
     
AS A MEANS OF STUDYING THE PRESENT PUBLIC CATALOGUES AND POSSIBLE CATALOGUE
FORMAT ALTERNATIVES AT THE IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, A 6-WEEK STUDY WAS
CONDUCTED. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE (1) TO DETERMINE THE CORRELATION
BETWEEN OTHER LIBRARY STATISTICS (E.G., DOOR COUNTS AND CIRCULATION RECORDS)
AND USE OF THE PUBLIC CATALOGUES; (2) TO CALCULATE THE RATIO BETWEEN USE OF
THE CARD CATALOGUE AND THE SEPARATE SERIALS CATALOGUE, (3) TO COMPARE THE
LIBRARY STAFF'S USE OF THE CATALOGUE WITH USE BY THE PUBLIC; AND (4) TO OBTAIN
INFORMATION ABOUT USE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE AND THE SERIALS CATALOGUE IN EACH
OF SEVERAL AUTONOMOUS LIBRARY SERVICE POINTS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ACCESS POINTS FOR SERIALS.
     
REFERING TO MAJOR CATALOGUING CODES ISSUED SINCE 1841, DISCUSSES THE
DIFFICULTY OF CHOOSING CONSISTENT ACCESS POINTS FOR SERIALS ISSUED OR
PUBLISHED BY CORPORATE BODIES. SUGGESTS THE APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF
CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP AS DEFINED BY EVA VERONA (WHICH MEANS THAT THE CHOICE OF
ACCESS POINTS FOR SERIALS PUBLISHED OR ISSUED BY CORPORATE BODIES COULD BE
CONSISTENTLY DETERMINED BY THE SAME CATALOGUING PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO ALL
OTHER DOCUMENTS) TO THE RULES FOR CORPORATE ENTRY IN AACR 2 (ANGLO-AMERICAN
CATALOGUING RULES, 2ND EDITION).
BIBLIOGRAPHY ON THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES SECOND EDITION.

LOCAL NEWSPAPER INDEXING' A PUBLIC LIBRARY REPORTS ITS EXPERIENCE.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER INDEXING
PROJECT IN PROGRESS AT THE NAPA CITY-COUNTY LIBRARY IN CALIFORNIA. THE INDEX
ENCOMPASSES 2 SETS OF NEWSPAPERS-SELECTED PAPERS FROM 1857 TO 1900, AND A
CURRENT DAILY NEWSPAPER. THE 2 INDEXES HAVE DIFFERENT SCOPES AND ARE HOUSED
SEPARATELY, BUT SHARE A COMMON SUBJECT AUTHORITY FILE AND FORMAT. AN INDEXER'S
MANUAL WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE A PORTABLE AUTHORITY FILE, AND TO INSTRUCT
INDEXERS ON INDEXING PRINCIPLES, SCOPE RULES, AND DIFFICULT COMPONENTS.
DISCUSSES BRIEFLY SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE INDEX.
A KNOWLEDGE-BASED LITERATURE GUIDE SYSTEM-A NEW APPROACH TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL.
     
PRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL BASED ON A SEMANTIC MODEL FOR
NATURAL LANGUAGE. THE CONTENT OF A DOCUMENT IS REPRESENTED USING THE
HIERARCHICAL MODEL OF KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION, ITS SENTENCES BEING TRANSLATED
INTO LOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS WHICH ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE AS
AN ORGANISED KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE. QUERIES ARE ALSO IN NATURAL LANGUAGE, FROM
WHICH RETRIEVAL COMMANDS ARE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED. ANSWERS ARE SYNTHESISED
FROM THE RESULTS OF RETRIEVAL. A WORKING SYSTEM CALLED LGS (LITERATURE GUIDE
SYSTEM) HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED. THIS CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS BASED ON THE
INTEGRATED ABSTRACTS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. EXAMPLES USING LGS ARE
PRESENTED.
THE DUALITY OF CLASSIFICATION' TAXONOMY AND MERONOMY.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. IN THE
CONTEXT OF NATURAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT, CLASSIFICATION IS
VIEWED AS THE GROUPING OF OBJECTS IN CLASSES (TAXONS) AND AS THE FINDING OF
COMMON STRUCTURES (ARCHETYPES) WITHIN THE OBJECTS. AN ARCHETYPE IS A STRUCTURE
OF PARTS (MERONS). THE CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE CAN BE REPRESENTED AS AN
INTERACTIVE PROCESS WHEREBY THE GROUPING BY TAXONS ALTERNATES WITH THE
IDENTIFICATION OF TAXON ARCHETYPES, WHICH ARE USED AGAIN TO UPDATE THE TAXON
COMPOSITION. PRESENTS A MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE TAXONOMIC GROUPING OF OBJECTS AND THEIR PARTITIONING INTO MERONS, WITH
SPECIAL MENTION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION.

SOME SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF CURRENT CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH IN INDIA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. BASED
ON THE PAPER 'A GENERAL THEORY OF SIL, POPSI AND CLASSAURUS', SUBMITTED FOR
DISCUSSION AT THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH FORUM, MINNEAPOLIS,
OCT 79. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF 3 INDIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS. A
GENERAL THEORY OF SUBJECT INDEXING LANGUAGE (SIL) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
LOGICAL ABSTRACTION OF THE STRUCTURES OF OUTSTANDING SILS. THE LANGUAGE OF
POSTULATE-BASED PERMUTED SUBJECT INDEXING (POPSI) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF SILS FORMING PART OF THE GENERAL
THEORY. THE CLASSAURUS HAS ALSO BEEN FORMULATED; THIS IS A FACETED SYSTEMATIC
SCHEME OF HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION HAVING ALL THE NECESSARY ATTRIBUTES OF A
CONVENTIONAL THESAURUS, EXCLUDING THE NUMERATION OF OTHER RELATED TERMS AND IS
ESPECIALLY MEANT TO FACILITATE THE USE OF POPSI.
SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN LARGE UNIVERSAL LIBRARIES.
     
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING (CLASSIFICATION) IN LARGE GENERAL
LIBRARIES, PARTICULARLY IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH
AMERICA' NATIONAL, UNIVERSITY, LARGE PUBLIC AND ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARIES
WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. DISCUSSES SUBJECT HEADINGS AND USE OF THE MAIN
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES, INCLUDING DEWEY, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND COLON.
CLASSIFICATION METHODS EMPLOYED IN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY PRODUCTION ARE ALSO
DESCRIBED. THE LARGEST GROUP OF LIBRARIES USES ITS OWN SYSTEMS, THEN
SUCCESSIVELY DDC, LCC, UDC AND BBK. THE SITUATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE MUCH
IN THE FUTURE, BUT THE NUMBER OF LIBRARIES USING THEIR OWN SCHEMES WILL
DIMINISH, WHILE THE CLASSED CATALOGUE TOGETHER WITH THE ALPHABETICAL SUBJECT
CATALOGUE WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE COMMON.
ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB BIOLOGICAL AND AGRICULTURAL
SCIENCES GROUP MEETING, BRITISH MUSEUM (NATURAL HISTORY), LONDON, 11 AND 12
NOVEMBER 1980).T
     
HE THEME OF THE MEETING WAS BIOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE AND CLASSIFICATION APPLIED
TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. AMONGST THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED WERE ZOOLOGICAL
NOMENCLATURE AND TAXONOMY, NAMES OF LIVING ORGANISMS IN A THESAURUS ON ANIMAL
HEALTH AND HYGIENE; AND TAXONOMY AND THE SCIENCE REFERENCE LIBRARY
CLASSIFICATION. ALL 13 PAPERS ARE REPRINTED, AND A SUMMARY OF THE DISCUSSION
FOLLOWS.
UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AT THE START OF THE EIGHTIES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH.
CONTRASTS THE VISIBLE CRISIS OF UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS IN THE LAST
4-5 DECADES WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT DURING 1876-1907. POINTS OUT
SOME SIGNS OF REVIVAL IN THE 1970S-THE APPEARANCE OF SEVERAL GENERAL
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS HAVING UP TO 3-4,000 HEADINGS. STRESSES THE NEED FOR
SUCH SYSTEMS AND ENUMERATES THEIR MAIN APPLICATIONS. DISTINGUISHES THE LEVELS
OF SPECIFICITY OF UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AND DISCUSSES THEIR FUTURE
PROSPECTS.
LIBRARIES IN THE WORLD AND CLASSIFICATIONS USED BY THEM.
     
THE CONDITION OF THE LIBRARIES IN EUROPE, USSR AND USA IS ANALYSED
COMPARATIVELY WITH THAT OF THE LIBRARIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND
RUMANIA. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON THE USE OF CLASSIFICATIONS, THEIR AREA OF
APPLICATION, THEIR ADVANTAGES AND DEFICIENCIES, LAYING A SPECIAL STRESS ON THE
USE OF THE UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION UNDER ITS DIFFERENT VERSIONS.
CONCORDANCES BETWEEN CLASSIFICATIONS AND UNION LISTS BETWEEN COLLECTIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH.
EXAMINES THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS,
FOCUSING ON EXTENTIONAL SIMILARITY. SOME PARALLELS ARE IDENTIFIED BETWEEN THE
CONCORDANCING OF CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AND THE COMPILING OF UNION LISTS.
CONCORDANCE OF CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS IS A MOST USEFUL AID FOR THE IMPROVEMENT
OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION.
THE RETURN OF BLISS.
     
OUTLINES THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE BLISS BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION,
DESCRIBING AND EVALUATING THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN THE 2ND EDITION. ALTHOUGH
OVERSHADOWED BY THE MAJOR SCHEMES IT CONSTITUTES A NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND
STILL HAS POTENTIAL ALBEIT IN A RESTRICTED MARKET.
A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS COLLECTIONS.
     
THE UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON'S ROESCH LIBRARY REQUIRED A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR
ITS LOCAL DOCUMENTS COLLECTION. IT NEEDED A SCHEME THAT WOULD ASSIGN EACH
TITLE A UNIQUE CALL NUMBER. EXISTING SCHEMES WERE EXAMINED BUT REJECTED. A NEW
ALPHANUMERIC SCHEME WAS DEVISED. IT IS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR COLLECTIONS
LIMITED TO PUBLICATIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND CIVIC ORGANISATIONS OF NO MORE
THAN SEVERAL COUNTIES.
LCSH' AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN MARY KAY PIETRIS AND SANDY BERMAN.
     
PRESENTS LETTERS EXCHANGED BETWEEN MARY KAY PIETRIS, CHIEF OF THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS SUBJECT CATALOGING DIVISION, AND SANDY BERMAN, HEAD CATALOGUER AT
HENNEPIN COUNTY LIBRARY, MINNESOTA, ON WHETHER SUBJECT HEADINGS SHOULD FOLLOW
OR USHER IN SOCIAL CHANGES. THE LETTERS WERE WRITTEN DURING AUG 79-AUG 80 AND
DISCUSS IN GREATEST DETAIL THE SENIORS/AGED AND HANDICAPPED/DISABLED
ALTERNATIVES.
AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR GENERATING THESAURUS FROM SUBJECT REPRESENTATIONS.
     
THE WORK REPORTED USES A CODING SCHEME DEVELOPED FOR AUGMENTING THE SUBJECT
STRINGS TO MAKE THEM SUITABLE FOR GENERATING A THESAURUS. THE SYSTEM IS FULLY
AUTOMATIC UNLIKE EARLIER SYSTEMS. IT HAS 5 PHASES NAMELY, CODING PHASE,
TERM-PAIR GENERATION PHASE, COORDINATE TERM-PAIR GENERATION PHASE, TRANSLATION
PHASE AND PRINTING PHASE. THE SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED BRIEFLY GIVING THE SYSTEMS
FLOW CHART AND INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF THE DIFFERENT PHASES TOGETHER WITH A
SAMPLE PRINTOUT OF A MODEL THESAURUS GENERATED USING TEST DATA OF ABOUT 60
SUBJECT STRINGS IN TELEPHONY.
ARMS SEMINAR.
     
REPORT OF A SEMINAR ON TCI'S ARMS INSTALLATIONS (AUTOMATED RECORDS MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM), 12 JUNE 80. EACH ARMS APPLICATION IS A SEPARATELY ENGINEERED SYSTEM,
COMBINING ADVANCED MICROMEDIA, COMPUTER AND VIDEO TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE SECURE
DOCUMENT CONTROL AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS. AN ARMS INSTALLATION COULD HAVE 4
DIFFERENT SUBSYSTEMS' DOCUMENT INDEXING, VIDEO DISTRIBUTION, DIGITAL DRAWING,
AND A DOCUMENT SCANNER/COM SYSTEM. THE PRICE RANGES FROM *6500,000 TO *62
MILLION. QUESTIONS THE NEED FOR SUCH SYSTEMS IN THE UK AND EUROPE.
HOLOGRAPHIC INFORMATION MEDIA.
     
DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITIES OF A HOLOGRAPHIC METHOD OF ULTRAMINIATURISATION,
STORAGE, AND RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION AND INVESTIGATES THE
OPERATION AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND FEATURES OF SUCH A SYSTEM.
TRENDS IN USE OF COMPUTER-READABLE INFORMATION CARRIERS ABROAD.
     
REVIEWS NON-SOVIET LITERATURE (1972-77) ON THE PROBLEMS OF CREATING
COMPUTER-READABLE INFORMATION CARRIERS; DESCRIBES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
BATCH AND ON-LINE PROCESSING DATA BASES; AND DISCUSSES DATA BASE SELECTION
PROBLEMS.
INFORMATION PROCESSING TODAY AND TOMORROW.
     
AS A 1ST STEP IN DETERMINING UK LOCAL AUTHORITY INFORMATION-PROCESSING
EQUIPMENT NEEDS, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OPERATIONAL RESEARCH UNIT COMPILED A
DIRECTORY OF THE MAIN DATA HOLDINGS IN BERKSHIRE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND
MONITORED ITS USE BY LOCAL OFFICERS. THE DIRECTORY WAS LITTLE-USED; WHEN
OFFICERS REQUIRED DATA, THEY ASKED PERSONAL CONTACTS. THIS INDICATES THAT THE
VALUE OF PROVIDING EXTENSIVE SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL FACILITIES IN LOCAL
AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. THE INTRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC
RECORD-KEEPING MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO USE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY.
THREE UPDATEABLE MICROFICHE SYSTEMS.
     
PRESENTS A COLLECTIVE DESCRIPTION AND DISCUSSION OF 3 UPDATEABLE MICROFICHE
SYSTEMS-THE A.B. DICK SYSTEM 200 RECORD PROCESSOR, THE MICROX SYSTEM II, AND
THE MICROVONICS FILE, WITH DETAILS OF BASIC DESIGN, RECORDING TECHNOLOGIES,
OPERATION, INPUT ACCEPTED, MICROFICHE FORMATS, TITLING, ACCESSORIES AND
PRICES.
SPACE UTILIZATION AND ACCESS PATH LENGTH IN B-TREES.
     
B-TREES (BALANCED TREES) ARE USED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF VERY LARGE INDEXES. A
STATE VECTOR AND SYSTEM OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE BEHAVIOUR OF
STATE CHANGES, FORM A DETERMINISTIC MODEL OF THE STATIC PROPERTIES. A UNIFORM
DISTRIBUTION OF KEYS IS ASSUMED. STATIC PROPERTIES, OPERATIONS ON B-TREES, AND
OVERFLOW AND UNDERFLOW TREATMENT ARE DEFINED. A BASIC MODEL OF B-TREES IS USED
TO MODEL SPACE UTILISATION AND PATH LENGTH WHICH IS THEN APPLIED TO THE
TREATMENT OF UNDERFLOW AND OVERFLOW IN B-TREE ORGANISATION.
INFOLOGICAL MODELS AND INFORMATION USER VIEWS.
     
THE DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRES INFORMATION CONTENT TO BE DEFINED
INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE HANDLING OF INFORMATION. THE INFOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
STRESSES THIS AND IS BASED ON A SEMANTICAL MODEL RATHER THAN A REAL-WORLD
MODEL. SOME OF THE BASIC INFOLOGICAL CONCEPTS DISCUSSED ARE THE INFORMATIONAL
REPRESENTATION OF DATA ITEMS, ELEMENTARY MESSAGES AND THEIR STRUCTURE, AND
E-SENTENCES. A LARGE NUMBER OF CONCEPTS AND TERMS IS REQUIRED WITH A
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION DATA DICTIONARY CONSISTENT WITH THE
RELEVANT USER VIEW. THE CHARACTERISTICS AND FORMATION OF CONCEPT DATA OBJECTS
AND PROPERTY REFERENCES ARE DESCRIBED, CREATING A HIERARCHIC CONCEPT
STRUCTURE. THE HERMENEUTICAL CIRCLE (INFOLOGICAL MEANING IN HERMENEUTICAL
TEXTS) IS DEMONSTRATED, AND THE INFOLOGICAL AND DATALOGICAL USER VIEWS ARE
DESCRIBED AND COMPARED.
RELEVANCE OF INFORMATION SYNTAX TO COMPUTER DATA STRUCTURES.
     
WORK BY THE UK CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE ITS COMMUNICATIONS IS OUTLINED
WITH SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 'META-SYSTEM' EMBRACING VARIOUS
WORD CONTROL AND CLASSIFICATION TOOLS. THE NEED TO RELATE THIS WORK TO THE
PROBLEM OF COMPUTER FILE ORGANISATION IS STRESSED. A STUDY BEING UNDERTAKEN BY
THE UK DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THIS
RELATIONSHIP AND THE BENEFITS WHICH CLOSER COLLABORATION WOULD BRING IS
DESCRIBED.

SERIAL NUMBERS'-.
CROSS DATA BASE SEARCHING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON ON-LINE TECHNOLOGY. ARGUES THAT THE
CONTINUED GROWTH OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES HAS INCREASED THE
NUMBER OF DATA BASES CONSULTED FOR ANY ONE SEARCH, AND SO HAS BROUGHT ABOUT
CHANGES IN THE ROLE OF THE SEARCHER AND THE ON-LINE SERVICE VENDOR. DESCRIBES
HOW US DATA BASE VENDOR SDC SEARCH SERVICE HAS RESPONDED TO THE NEED FOR CROSS
DATA BASE SEARCHING BY SOFTWARE MODIFICATION, STANDARDISATION OF FIELD NAMES
AND SEARCH QUALIFIERS, AND BY THE INTRODUCTION OF A SAVE SEARCH FACILITY.
DISCUSSES IN DETAIL THE USE OF A PARTICULAR SAVED SEARCH STRATEGY FOR CROSS

ONLINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AT UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF
GERMANY-A PROGRESS REPORT.
     
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME FOR THE PROMOTION OF INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION WAS PASSED ON 17 DEC 74. THE AIM OF THE PROGRAMME WAS TO
COORDINATE AND IMPROVE ACTIVITIES IN THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SECTOR
WHICH HAD DEVELOPED RAPIDLY IN RECENT YEARS. THE PROGRAMME CONCENTRATED ON
SETTING UP 4 SUBJECT ORIENTED DATA SYSTEMS' PATENTS, RESEARCH PROCEDURE,
ENVIRONMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL RULES. THE PROGRESS IN EACH AREA HAS BEEN
DIFFERENT. 17 LIBRARIES RECEIVED AN ON-LINE CONNECTION TO THE DIMDI (DEUTSCHE
INSITUT FUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION) DATA BANK IN COLOGNE
IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A PROJECT ORGANISED BY THE MINISTRY FOR RESEARCH AND
TECHNOLOGY. LIBRARIES ALSO HAD ON-LINE CONNECTIONS TO DATA BANKS FORMED BY THE
INFORMATION CENTRE FOR ENERGY, PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS. THE QUESTION OF
FINANCE IS THE LARGEST OBSTACLE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES PROVIDING PERMANENT O
N-LINE FACILITIES FOR LITERATURE RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH SOME ON-LINE DATA SERVICES
ARE AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIES FREE OF CHARGE THE COST OF THE HARDWARE HAS TO BE
COVERED BY THE LIBRARIES.

INDICATED THAT THE SEARCHES YIELD A HIGH % OF RELEVANT CITATIONS FOR MOST
USERS. A FURTHER CORRELATION BETWEEN THE USERS' RESPONSES TO BROAD RELEVANCE
CATEGORIES AND THEIR PRESENCE AT THE TERMINAL DURING THE SEARCH RECONFIRMED
THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIVE FEEDBACK BETWEEN THE USER AND THE SEARCH
INTERMEDIARY IN IMPROVING SEARCH PRECISION. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT
TIME SAVINGS BY THE USERS. MOST RESPONDENTS ENDORSED THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF
THE SERVICE, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONGOING RESEARCH PROJECTS OR
STARTING A NEW PROJECT.

NEWSPAPERS ARE FACING CHALLENGES FROM THE NEW MEDIA OF TELETEXT, VIEWDATA
SYSTEMS, AND HOME COMPUTERS. TELETEXT PROVIDES NEWS IMMEDIATELY, SIMPLY,
CONVENIENTLY, AND INEXPENSIVELY. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE BROWSE AND
SCAN OPTIONS OF NEWSPAPERS. OF GREATER POTENTIAL IMPACT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
VIEWDATA SYSTEMS WHICH USE THE TELEVISION, TELEPHONE, AND COMPUTER SO THAT
ON-LINE SEARCHING CAN BE DONE FROM THE HOME. THE SYSTEM CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED
TO USE A HOME COMPUTER RATHER THAN A TELEVISION SCREEN. CHANGES IN HOW PEOPLE
SPEND THEIR LEISURE TIME AND THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME, COMBINED WITH THE
STAGNATION OF NEWSPAPER READERSHIP AND THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE OF
INFORMATION IN SOCIETY, SUGGEST THAT NEWSPAPERS SHOULD LOOK INTO NEW OPTIONS.

FILE AS A DEPENDABLE ARCHIVIST.
     
THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART OF INFORMATION PROCESSING TENDS TO LINK CERTAIN
CAPABILITIES (SUCH AS PROTECTION OF DATA INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY AND
MONITORING USER/DATA INTERACTIONS) WITH LARGE DATA BASE SYSTEMS. THIS IS MOST
UNFORTUNATE, SINCE SUCH CAPABILITIES ARE FREQUENTLY VITAL FOR MODEST
APPLICATIONS WHICH DO NOT HAVE THE DEGREE OF DATA COMPLEXITY TO JUSTIFY THE
USE OF LARGE DATA BASE SYSTEMS AND WHICH MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM.
DESCRIBES AN EFFORT TO BRIDGE THIS GAP IN CURRENT ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING
TECHNOLOGY BY MEANS OF A NEW LINGUISTIC CONCEPT OF FILES WHICH IS DESIGNED TO
SIMULATE A DEPENDABLE ARCHIVIST RATHER THAN A PASSIVE FILING CABINET.

NETWORK AT EACH STEP, AND CONVERGING TO OPTIMAL MINIMUM DELAY ROUTING.
A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPUTER NETWORK PLANNING.
     
A FRAMEWORK IS PRESENTED FOR PLANNING A NETWORK FOR A COMPUTER SERVICE
DELIVERY SYSTEM. THIS FRAMEWORK MAKES EXPLICIT A PLANNING MATRIX FOR FACTORING
THE COMPUTER NEEDS OF THE USERS IN MANAGEABLE UNITS AND DEVELOPS THE
PARAMETERS FOR DECIDING ON A SUITABLE NETWORK TO MEET THE POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS OF MANAGEMENT. THE MATRIX GIVES THE BASIS FOR STUDYING
ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS FOR MERGING THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE USERS. FOR
STUDYING CONFIGURATIONS BEYOND A STAND-ALONE SYSTEM, THE CONCEPT OF A NODE IS
INTRODUCED, PERMITTING THE CONSIDERATION OF A SET OF 6 CATEGORIES OF
PARAMETERS. VIEWPOINTS OF NETWORK STRUCTURES HAVING VARIOUS DEGREES OF
ORGANISATIONAL COMPLEXITY ARE DEFINED IN TERMS OF THE NODAL PARAMETERS.
DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE IN STORE-AND-FORWARD NETWORKS.

ACCOMMODATES ALL THE DESIRED MESSAGE ROUTES. USE OF GUARANTEED PATHS IN THE
BUFFER GRAPH AND OPTIONAL PATH SWITCHING ARE DESCRIBED, ALONG WITH MESSAGE
RECLASSIFICATION TO FREE MEMBERS OF THE COMMON BUFFER POOL. AN EFFICIENT
BUFFER-COUNTING PROCEDURE IN EACH NODE HANDLES MESSAGES REQUIRING SEVERAL
BUFFERS, INCREASES FLEXIBILITY OF BUFFER USAGE, MINIMISES OVERHEADS DURING
MESSAGE RECLASSIFICATION OR PATH SWITCHING, AND SIMPLIFIES JUMPING BETWEEN
NORMAL LOW-OVERHEAD OPERATION WHEN DEADLOCK IS FAR AND MORE CAREFUL OPERATION
WHEN DEADLOCK IS NEAR.

INTERFERING QUEUEING PROCESSES IN PACKET-SWITCHED BROADCAST COMMUNICATION.
     
CONSIDERS PACKET-QUEUEING PROCESSES IN 2 INTERFERING BUFFERED PACKET RADIO
UNITS THAT SHARE A SLOTTED ALOHA BROADCAST CHANNEL. SHOWS THAT CLASSICAL
APPROXIMATION SCHEMES FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PREDICTIONS CONCERNING
INTERFERING QUEUEING AND INTRODUCES A NEW SCHEME, TOPOLOGICAL APPROXIMATION,
WHICH PROVIDES AN EXACT SOLUTION OF AN APPROXIMATE MODEL, OBTAINED BY
PERTURBING THE TOPOLOGY OF INTERFERENCE. ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT INTERFERENCE MAY
BE CURED BY INCREASING THE INTERFERENCE AND THAT 'MAXIMUM INTERFERENCE'
PROVIDES A SUPERB FLOW-REGULATING MECHANISM AND THE BEST POSSIBLE
DELAY-THROUGHOUT PERFORMANCE.
SOFT TYPOGRAPHY.
     
IMPROVEMENTS IN DIGITAL VIDEO TYPOGRAPHY ARE SEEN AS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF
INCREASED INTERACTIVITY AND SCOPE OF USE OF SOFT COPY TEXT DISPLAY SYSTEMS. A
GRAYSCALING SCHEME PRODUCES HIGH-QUALITY FONTS FOR DISPLAY WITH STANDARD
COLOUR VIDEO EQUIPMENT, REDUCING SCINTILLATION, SMOOTHING CURVES, AND
IMPROVING ENCODABILITY. THE SAME CONCEPT ALLOWS A 'VIRTUAL RESOLUTION' FAR
BEYOND THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF NORMAL PIXEL SIZE, PERMITTING UP TO 80
CHARACTERS PER LINE OF READABLE TEXT ON COLOUR TELEVISIONS.
NTI: INTERNATIONAL GATEWAY TO TRANSPAC.
     
THE CENTRE COMMUN D'ETUDES DE TELEVISION ET DE TELECOMMUNICATIONS HAS

ADMINISTRATION IN COPING WITH PROBLEMS OF HANDLING VOLUMINOUS DATA IN ORDER TO
MAKE MEANINGFUL DECISIONS IN AN EVER-DIMINISHING TIME FRAME. HIGHLIGHTS INDIAN
GOVERNMENT PLANS TO INTRODUCE COMPUTER NETWORKS INCORPORATING DATA BASE
MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. DESCRIBES THE RATIONALE GOVERNING THE INDIAN LAW OF
INFORMATION REPOSITORY LOCATION AND THE 'TMJ' (TOP-MIDDLE-JUNIOR LEVEL)
ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT. HOPES THAT INDIA'S EXPERIENCE WILL
CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN
OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
A DISTRIBUTED DBMS BASED ON ANUNET-A COMMUNICATIONS AND RESOURCE SHARING
NETWORK.
     
BRIEFLY DESCRIBES ANUNET (THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY'S COMMUNICATIONS
NETWORK); WORK ON DISTRIBUTED DATA BASES; TECHNICAL ASPECTS; AND PROBLEMS
RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTED DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE
PLANNED SYSTEM IS BASED ON A SINGLE HOST, UNIVAC 1100/42, RUNNING THE
UNIVERSITY'S OWN VERSION OF DMS 1100 (AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CODASYL DBTG
MODEL), WITH HETEROGENEOUS REMOTE NODES (PDP 11S, DECSYSTEM 10S, DATA GENERAL
NOVAS AND HEWLETT PACKARD 21MX AND 2100 MACHINES), SUPPORTING ANUNET
COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS AND DATA BASE MESSAGE LEVEL PROTOCOLS.
ATTITUDE STUDY OF ON-LINE TERMINAL OPERATORS ON WORK-STATION ARRANGEMENTS.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED COVERING 75 ON-LINE TERMINAL OPERATORS AT
A LARGE GAS UTILITY. THEY WERE ASKED TO GIVE PREFERENCE RATINGS TO ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGARD TO PANELLING, SEATING, BACKGROUND MUSIC, AND THE
LOCATION OF A TERMINAL ON THE DESK. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONDENTS PREFERRED
AN OPEN SPACE LAYOUT TO LAYOUTS WITH SOME PANELS, AND SOME BACKGROUND MUSIC TO
NO MUSIC. THESE RESULTS ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FINDINGS OF MOST PAST
STUDIES. AS TO SEATING ARRANGEMENTS, THEY GAVE THE HIGHEST PREFERENCE TO A
RANDOM ARRANGEMENT MADE INDEPENDENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S SEX OR SENIORITY. WITH
RESPECT TO THE LOCATION OF A TERMINAL, THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE OPERATOR WAS
RATED HIGHEST BY ABOUT 1/2 OF THE RESPONDENTS, AND THE CENTRE OF THE DESK BY
1/4 OF THEM.
THE JAPANESE WORD PROCESSOR JW-10.
     
DESCRIBES THE JAPANESE WORD PROCESSOR JW-10, WHICH IS THE 1ST SUCH PROCESSOR
IN THE WORLD. THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT IN DEVELOPING A JAPANESE WORD
PROCESSOR IS FINDING AN EASY INPUT METHOD FOR THE NUMEROUS CHINESE CHARACTERS
USED IN JAPANESE. FOR TEXT INPUT, JW-10 PERFORMS A KARA-TO-KANJI
(PHONOGRAM-TO-IDEOGRAM) TRANSLATION THROUGH GRAMMATIC ANALYSIS AND
CONSULTATION WITH AN 80,000-WORD DICTIONARY.
COMMUNICATIONS.
     
REVIEWS RECENT ADVANCES, AND DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY BE EXPECTED IN THE NEAR
FUTURE, IN THE AREA OF COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. THE WIDE RANGE OF FACILITIES
WHICH MAY BE PROVIDED ARE DESCRIBED INCLUDING VIEWDATA, CITIZENS BAND RADIO,
ELECTRONIC MAIL AND INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS. THE NEW EQUIPMENT WHICH IS BEING
INTRODUCED IS DESCRIBED. THE ACTIVITIES IN UK, USA, MIDDLE EAST, JAPAN, ITALY,
FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY ARE BRIEFLY CONSIDERED.
THE EFT REVOLUTION: DID SOMEONE CALL IT OFF OR DID IT HAPPEN WHEN I WASN'T
LOOKING?.
     
SO FAR, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER (EFT) SERVICES HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH LESS
THAN UNIVERSAL ENTHUSIASM BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. DISCUSSES THE SITUATION
REGARDING EFT IN THE USA.
A HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE FOR COMPUTER MAIL SYSTEMS.
     
PRESENTS AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL FOR LARGE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTER MAIL SYSTEMS.
THIS MODEL SPECIFIES' (1) A MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS THAT SUPPORTS
ALL COMPUTER MAIL FUNCTIONS; (2) THE FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURE OF EACH
COMPONENT; (3) THE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL NEEDED FOR INTERPROCESS
COMMUNICATION; AND (4) THE ORGANISATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION DATA BASE USED
TO SUPPORT IDENTIFICATION SERVICES IN THE ARCHITECTURE.

ANALYSES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR MESSAGE SERVICES AND BRIEFLY SURVEYS THE TYPES
OF FACILITY NOW PROVIDED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SERVICES. OUTLINES SOME ACTIONS
BEING CONSIDERED BY THE PUBLIC CARRIERS AND SUGGESTS SERVICES WHICH COULD
BECOME WIDELY AVAILABLE WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS.
ELECTRONIC MAIL: A SMART WAY TO DO BUSINESS?.
     
US TRENDS IN ELECTRONIC MAIL ARE HIGHLIGHTED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO
THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ELECTRONIC MAIL. VARIOUS ELECTRONIC MAIL
FACILITIES ARE PROFILED WITH DISCUSSION OF CATEGORIES OF SERVICE, TECHNOLOGY
FEATURES, COSTS, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF PARTICULAR ORGANISATION.
ELECTRONIC MAIL AND ITS IMPACT ON EUROPE.
     
TELETEX AND TELEMAIL ARE DISCUSSED AS POSSIBLE MEANS OF DEVELOPING AN
ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEMS WILL GROW
RAPIDLY. TELETEX WILL REMAIN IN THE CONTROL OF THE PTIS, HOWEVER THE PRICE OF
A TERMINAL IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT. A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM FROM
FRANCE IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. TELEMAIL IN THE UK IS CONTROLLED BY BRITISH
TELECOM AND AT PRESENT OFFERS A SIMILAR SERVICE TO THE TELEX SYSTEM.
REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EDUCATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM FOR SOUTH AMERICA.
     
THE NUMEROUS BENEFITS OF ESTABLISHING SATELLITE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN REALISED BY
THE NORTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND THE USSR. THERE IS NO DOUBT
THAT SOUTH AMERICA WILL SOON PARTICIPATE IN SATELLITE SYSTEMS. OF PRIMARY
IMPORTANCE NOW IS TO CONVINCE SOUTH AMERICA THAT A LOCALLY-CONSTRUCTED
EDUCATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM WOULD NOT IMPOSE FOREIGN CULTURAL DOMINATION, BUT
WOULD BE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS BY WHICH SOUTH AMERICANS COULD BE LIBERATED,
GIVING AN ECONOMIC SOLUTION TO THEIR GROWING EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS.
EVOLUTION OF U.S. DOMESTIC SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.
     
TRACES THE SALIENT PHASES OF THE EVOLUTION OF US DOMESTIC SATELLITE
COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE PROPOSALS ADVANCED DURING 1965-67 TO THE EVENTS WHICH
CULMINATED IN THE 'OPEN ENTRY' POLICY ANNOUNCED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATION
COMMISSION IN EARLY 1970. THE APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED BY 8 ENTITIES IN 1971 ARE
BRIEFLY REVIEWED AND VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS WHICH REDUCED THE NUMBER OF SEPARATE
SYSTEMS THAT EVENTUALLY ATTAINED OPERATIONAL STATUS ARE SURVEYED. OUTLINES 4
SYSTEMS (THOSE OF WESTERN UNION, AMERICAN SATELLITE CORPORATION, RCA, AND
COMSAT GENERAL/AT&T-GSAT), DISCUSSES THE FORTHCOMING ALL-DIGITAL
COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM OF SBS, AND LOOKS AHEAD TO FUTURE SYSTEMS AND
SERVICES.
THE SIRIO PROGRAMME AND DEVELOPMENTS IN SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.

TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTS AND FOR PROPAGATION AND COMMUNICATION EXPERIMENTS IN
THE 12 AND 18 GHZ FREQUENCY BANDS. DESCRIBES THE ITALIAN NATIONAL RESEARCH
COUNCIL'S SIRIO PROGRAMME, THE AIMS AND ORGANISATION OF THE PROPAGATION AND
COMMUNICATION EXPERIMENTS, AND THE SATELLITE ITSELF.
VISUAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY' PRIORITIES FOR THE 1980S.
     
SINCE THE LATE 1970S, THE JAPANESE NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE PUBLIC
CORPORATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING RESEARCH TO DETERMINE WHICH VISUAL
COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND STUDY PROGRAMMES WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE 1980S.
MARKET RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT TO ASCERTAIN THE MAJOR VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS
REQUIREMENTS IN LEADING BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS. THE SYSTEMS FOUND TO HAVE THE
GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT WERE VIDEOCONFERENCING, INTERACTIVE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, FACSIMILE, DOCUMENT PROCESSING, AND OFFICE AUTOMATION
(THE LATTER INTEGRATING ALL 4 SYSTEMS). IN THE LIGHT OF THESE RESULTS,
SUGGESTS A STUDY PROGRAMME FOR THE 80S AND INDICATES WHICH TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD
BE DEVELOPED.
FORCES WHICH UNDERMINE MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT.
     
REPRODUCED FROM 2CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW1, SUMMER 63. IN A SURPRISING
NUMBER OF CASES, ORGANISATIONS INTERESTED IN THE CREATIVE GROWTH OF THEIR
PERSONNEL ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE THE GROWTH THEY SEEK. ANALYSES THE FORCES
THAT-REGARDLESS OF THE INTENTIONS OF THE ORGANISATIONS INVOLVED-AFFECT SUCH
GROWTH.
ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT' SOME PROBLEMS AND PROPOSALS.
     
REPRODUCED FROM 2THE JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE1, 1974. CITES SOME
PROBLEMS CONCERNING ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (THE APPLICATION OF CHANGES AND
ACHIEVEMENT OF GOALS IN AN ORGANISATION), THE RESOLUTION OF WHICH WILL
FACILITATE THE TRANSITION OF ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FROM A MISCELLANY OF
UNCERTAIN DEVICES TO A MATURE, USABLE SET OF PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES AND
THUS MAKE THE DISCIPLINE BETTER THAN IT IS AT PRESENT, IN BOTH THEORY AND
PRACTICE.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS CURRICULA' BUSINESS 2VERSUS1 ACADEMIC VIEWPOINTS.
     
COMPARES THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF MANAGERS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACTIVITIES
IN 2FORTUNE 5001 ORGANISATIONS AND A SURVEY OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS FACULTY OF
ACCREDITED BUSINESS SCHOOLS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR OPINIONS ON THE DESIRED
COMPOSITION OF UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMMES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS OFFERED BY
SCHOOLS OF BUSINESS. INFORMATION IS PRESENTED ON THE RESPONDENT'S OPINIONS
ABOUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF' (1) EDUCATIONAL OUTPUT OBJECTIVES THAT
GRADUATES OF SUCH PROGRAMS MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO POSSESS AND (2) COURSES AND
TOPICS WITHIN COURSES DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. SIMILARITIES AND
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BUSINESS AND ACADEMIC RESPONSES ARE ANALYSED.
THE IMPACT OF WARFARE ON THE RATE OF INVENTION' A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF
UNITED STATES ACTIVITY.
     
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO SHIFT THE FIELDS IN WHICH RESEARCH
IS CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT, MILITARY CONFLICT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CREDITED
WITH BEING THE CATALYST WHICH HAS CAUSED DECISIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. IT
IS ALSO GENERALLY SUGGESTED THAT WARFARE HAS A SYSTEMATIC IMPACT ON THE
INTENSITY OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY. MOST SCHOLARS HAVE CLAIMED THAT WARS INCREASE
INVENTIVENESS, ALTHOUGH A FEW ARGUE THAT CONFLICT IS A HINDERANCE TO RESEARCH.
THIS QUESTION HAS NOT RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION. USING US DATA,
A BASIC PATTERN IS REPEATEDLY OBSERVED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF A
WAR, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INVENTIVENESS, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A
MARKED SURGE. THE AVERAGE NET RESULT IS A VIRTUAL NEGATION OF THE 2 TRENDS.
THE MAIN METHODS AND STAGES OF WRITING AN ANALYTICAL REVIEW.
     
DISCUSSES A SYSTEM OF LOGICAL AND HEURISTIC INFORMATION PROCESSING TO BE USED
DURING THE COMPILATION OF AN ANALYTICAL REVIEW. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCERNING CHOICE OF REVIEW TOPIC AND THE TECHNIQUES BY WHICH FRESH
INFORMATION RECEIVED WHEN WRITING A REVIEW CAN BE INCLUDED IN IT. DISCUSSES
THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES OF A REVIEW, IDENTIFIES STAGES IN THE REVIEW WRITING
PROCESS, AND OUTLINES A REVIEW STRUCTURE.
READING TODAY' A PROBLEM IN MANY DISCIPLINES.
     
READING WAS LONG SEEN AS A PURELY PEDAGOGIC PROBLEM AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND
PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS IGNORED. ITS RELATIONSHIP TO WRITING AND TO THE PROCESS
OF UNDERSTANDING HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL
CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES INCLUDING SOCIOLOGY, LINGUISTICS AND
TRADITIONAL PHILOLOGY. RECENT KEY WORKS APPROACHING THE READING PROBLEM FROM
VARIOUS STANDPOINTS ARE CITED AND DISCUSSED.
ON THE READER'S OWN TERMS' LITERATURE FOR READERS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN
UNDERSTANDING, DIFFICULTY IN PERSISTING, OR WHO HAVE ANOTHER LANGUAGE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE SWEDISH 'ER' (EASY TO READ) BOOK SYSTEM, INSTIGATED BY A WORKING
GROUP AT THE NATIONAL SWEDISH BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE BOOKS ARE DESIGNED FOR
PARTICULAR READER GROUPS, PRIMARILY ADULT READERS, WHO HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTIES
IN READING OR IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY READ. 100 OR SO TITLES HAVE BEEN
PUBLISHED TO DATE, AND IT IS PLANNED TO PUBLISH A FURTHER 15-20 TITLES PER
YEAR. A SPECIAL EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN STARTED INVOLVING THE PUBLICATION OF ER
BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE, ALTHOUGH PRODUCTION OF ER BOOKS FOR
ADULTS IS STILL A PRIORITY.
THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF LOCAL HISTORY BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, MUCH GREATER ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO LOCAL
HISTORY IN BULGARIA THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. STAFF IN THE REGIONAL
CENTRAL LIBRARIES HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO PRODUCE AND PUBLISH RELEVANT
BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER MATERIAL DEALING WITH THE PAST AND PRESENT OF THEIR
PARTICULAR REGIONS. AS A RULE, SIGNIFICANT POLITICIANS AND POLITICAL EVENTS
ARE WELL COVERED BY SUCH PUBLICATIONS, AS ARE WRITERS AND OTHER PROMINENT
PEOPLE WHO EITHER LIVE OR LIVED IN THE REGION, OR WHO WERE BORN THERE, BUT WHO
ARE NOW MORE WIDELY KNOWN. NAMES OF NUMEROUS PUBLICATIONS ARE GIVEN, WHICH CAN
BE CONSIDERED VALUABLE AIDS TO THOSE STUDYING LOCAL HISTORY. TOPICS DEALING,
FOR INSTANCE, WITH THE REGIONS' ECONOMY, CULTURAL LIFE, HEALTH SERVICE, ARTS
AND OTHER ASPECTS MUST NOT BE NEGLECTED, AS PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW OF SOCIAL AND
OTHER CHANGES IN THEIR SURROUNDINGS. GRADUALLY, THE INFORMATION GIVEN SHOULD
BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE SMA LLER AND/OR SPECIALISED SECTIONS OF THE REGION,
SUCH AS TOWNS AND PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES.
SECTION DEVOTED TO SOVIET EXPERIENCES' RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CLASSIFICATION,
CATALOGUING AND THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.F
     
OR AN ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBER'-.
GROWTH OF INDIAN SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS 1788-1965' AN OUTLINE OF A
COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE COMPILATION OF A COMPLETE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
INDIAN SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS. IT HAS BEEN PLANNED TO BRING OUT A MONOGRAPH
CONTAINING THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF ABOUT 6000 PERIODICALS. THE PRESENT
CONTRIBUTION IS A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE SCOPE, ARRANGEMENT, INDEXES, AND
METHODOLOGY OF COMPILATION OF THIS PROJECTED PUBLICATION.
THE QUALITY CONTROL OF DOCUMENT DESIGN.
     
BEHAVIOURAL RESEARCH OFFERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES FOR USE DURING
THE DESIGN OF WRITTEN MATERIALS. EXPLORES THE PROS AND CONS OF 4 OF THESE, IN
RELATION TO A 3-STAGE QUALITY-CONTROL PROGRAMME. THE 3 STAGES INVOLVE CHECKS
ON THE CONTENT, THE PRESENTATION AND USABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THE COMPLEXITIES
OF DESIGN PROBLEMS ARE SUCH THAT THE RESEARCH LITERATURE WILL SELDOM BE ABLE
TO PROVIDE INSTANT SOLUTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, RESEARCH TECHNIQUES PROVIDE WAYS
OF GUIDING AND VAILDATING THE DECISIONS OF WRITERS AND DESIGNERS.
FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION DESIGN' RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.
     
ALTHOUGH FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVES HAVE CONCERNED DESIGNERS FOR MANY YEARS, AND
PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE PUBLISHED RESEARCH ON ISSUES RELATED TO GRAPHIC DESIGN,
FRUITFUL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 2 SPECIALISMS HAS ONLY RARELY BEEN ACHIEVED.
SUGGESTS THAT THE TRADITIONAL OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF NEITHER GROUP ARE
SUFFICIENTLY ORIENTED TOWARDS THE COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION IN A COMPLEX
SOCIETY. A USER-CENTRED APPROACH IS URGED, DRAWING FROM BOTH THE INTUITIVE
PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS OF DESIGNERS AND THE METHODOLOGIES OF PSYCHOLOGISTS.
LEARNED SOCIETIES AND ON-DEMAND BOOK PUBLISHING.
     
A SURVEY WAS MADE OF 220 UK LEARNED SOCIETIES IN THE FIELDS OF ARTS,
HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE AIM WAS TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY HAD EXCESS
BOOK-LENGTH MATERIAL WHICH THEY CONSIDERED WORTHY OF PUBLICATION BUT COULD NOT
AFFORD TO PUBLISH. FURTHER, THEY WERE ASKED WHETHER THEY HAD CONSIDERED THE
OPTION OF ON-DEMAND (OD) PUBLISHING AND WHAT FEATURES AN ON-DEMAND SYSTEM
SHOULD HAVE. OF 101 USABLE RESPONSES, 24 SAID THAT THEY DID HAVE SUCH AN
EXCESS, TOTALLING 160 MANUSCRIPTS. OVERALL, 38 FELT THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR
SOME CENTRALLY ORGANISED OD FACILITY. THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF SUCH A
SYSTEM WOULD BE QUALITY CONTROL, PRICE AND HARD-COPY AVAILABILITY.
DOLLAR WISE, POUND FOOLISH: BRITISH BOOKS IN CANADA-A BUYER'S GUIDE TO SOME
HARD-WON IMPROVEMENTS.
     
CANADIAN BOOK IMPORTING AGENTS ARE MOVING TO THE POINT AT WHICH THEY WILL
CEASE TO BUY BRITISH BOOKS, WHICH ARE FAR TOO COSTLY. THE CANADIAN BOOK
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IS MUCH STRONGER TODAY, THUS NEGATING BRITISH PUBLISHERS'
ASSERTATIONS THAT ONLY THE PRICE IS A HANDICAP TO GOOD TRADING. PRESENTS THE
COMMENTS AND EXPERIENCES OF SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED IN BOOK BUYING IN CANADA,
AND ACTION TAKEN IN ORDER TO AVOID SIMPLY 'IMPORTING INFLATION'.
COPYRIGHT CREATORS TAKE COLLECTIVE ACTION.
     
REPORT OF A COPYRIGHT SEMINAR HELD IN MONTREAL'S PLACE BONAVENTURE, 26 NOV 80.
THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE MEETING WAS CANADA'S COPYRIGHT LAWS, AND PROCEEDINGS
WERE DIRECTED MAINLY AT WRITERS AND PUBLISHERS, WHOSE CHIEF CONCERN WAS
PHOTOCOPYING IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
BOOK CLUBS AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS BOOKCLUBS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SEVERELY CRITICISED BY AUTHORS
FOR PAYING MUCH SMALLER ROYALTIES THAN THE NORMAL BOOKTRADE. THE 1ST BOOKCLUB
IN THE NETHERLANDS WAS FOUNDED IN 1937 AND THERE ARE NOW 6 REGISTERED CLUBS
WITH A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF APPROX. 1 1/2 MILLION MEMBERS. THE MARKET SHARE OF
THE BOOKCLUBS IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS RISEN FROM 2% IN 1966 TO 24% IN 1980. THE
REMOVAL OF THE COLLECTIVE PRICE AGREEMENT ON BOOKS WOULD ALSO BE DISASTROUS
FOR THE SMALLER BOOKSHOPS AND PUBLISHERS AND FOR LESSER-KNOWN AUTHORS.
BOOKSELLERS AND PUBLISHERS MUST NOW COME TO A TRADING ARRANGEMENT WITH THE
BOOKCLUBS. IT IS, HOWEVER, FORTUNATE THAT THE LARGER BOOKCLUBS ARE THEMSELVES
PART OF THE PUBLISHING TRADE.
ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING-ITS DARKER SIDE.
     
REVIEWS THE UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR THE INTEREST IN ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING; THE
TYPES OF PUBLICATION BEST SUITED FOR CONVERSION FROM PRINT TO ELECTRONIC
MEDIA; AND SOME ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING ISSUES (RIVAL ATTRACTIONS OF TEXT AND
DATA BASE; AUTHORSHIP, COPYRIGHT, AND FORGERY; QUALITY OF WRITING; AND
INFORMATION 2VERSUS1 KNOWLEDGE). OPINES THAT A BOOK'S INTERNAL ORGANISATION
HELPS TO INTEGRATE AND FORM THOUGHT PROCESSES AND FEARS THAT ELECTRONIC
PUBLISHING WILL DELIVER EVER MORE PERCEPTS BUT FEWER CONCEPTS-THIS MAY BE THE
DARKER SIDE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS REVOLUTION.
OUR OWN CHILDREN'S MAGAZINES: INSURING THEIR FUTURE.
     
IF CANADIAN CHILDREN'S MAGAZINES ARE TO REMAIN 'ALIVE', LIBRARIANS AND
ADMINISTRATORS MUST PROMOTE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN THE WAY
THEY RESPOND TO THEM. THE LIBRARY COMMUNITY RESPONDS FAVOURABLY TO CHILDREN'S
MAGAZINES, BUT ONLY A MINORITY OF THE COUNTRY'S SCHOOL CHILDREN HAS ACCESS TO
THEM IN THEIR SCHOOL LIBRARY.
THE SWETS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE SYSTEM.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON ON-LINE TECHNOLOGY. DISCUSSES THE
DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN AND OPERATION OF AN ON-LINE PERIODICALS SUBSCRIPTION
SERVICE BY THE DUTCH COMPANY SWETS AND ZEITLINGER. INDICATES THE WAY IN WHICH
THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE 'USER FRIENDLY' WITH A MINIMUM OF CODES AND GOOD
SUPPORT SERVICES. GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL OPERATIONAL SEQUENCE TO
ILLUSTRATE HOW THE SYSTEM IS CONSTRUCTED AND THE STANDARD MODULE USAGE.
CONSIDERS THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM, AND INCLUDES SOME SAMPLE PAGES
FROM THE TERMINAL USERS HANDBOOK, SHOWING SCREEN FORMAT.

DOMINATION IS SLOWLY BUT STEADILY DECLINING.
MOON AND ITS READERS.
     
THE MOON SYSTEM FOR THE BLIND IS MORE EASILY LEARNT AND READ THAN BRAILLE, AND
IS STILL THE ONLY READING SYSTEM USED BY SOME 600 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND. MOON READERS SHOW MORE INTEREST IN OLDER LIGHT
FICTIONAL WORKS THAN IN MODERN NOVELS, AND BIOGRAPHY IS POPULAR, BUT THERE IS
LITTLE DEMAND FOR SUCH SUBJECTS AS HISTORY, TRAVEL AND RELIGION. DESCRIBES THE
MOON READER, THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE AND THE PRODUCTION OF MOON BOOKS. MORE
WORKS IN MOON ARE NEEDED, BECAUSE AT PRESENT, IF READERS WANT A REAL CHOICE IN
BOOKS THEY HAVE TO READ BRAILLE. ASKS FOR COMMENTS FROM MOON READERS ON THE
ADEQUACY OF THE MOON LITERATURE EXTANT, AND ON THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD BE PUBLISHED.

FOR VIDEO DISC PLAYERS AND PLAYER SYSTEMS ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE POTENTIAL AT
EACH LEVEL FOR INTERACTIVITY IS ASSESSED.
DIAL-A-SLIDE SERVICE FOR PRODUCERS.
     
DESCRIBES THE VISUAL RESOURCES SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY THE UK COMPANY MARTAK FOR
ITS COLLECTION OF OVER 50,000 SLIDES. A CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS ARE RUN
AGAINST THE COMPUTERISED INDEX AND THE COMPUTER SELECTS AND DISPLAYS DETAILS
OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE SLIDE. A COPY OF THE SLIDE IS MADE AND DESPATCHED.
MOST USERS ARE PRODUCERS OF TAPE/SLIDE PRESENTATIONS. MARTAK IS HOPING TO
SERVICE THE COLLECTIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES AND IS TO MARKET A LESS COMPLEX
VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE, ENABLING COMPANIES TO SORT OUT THEIR COLLECTIONS
THEMSELVES.
A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEED-BACK ABILITY AND THE DENSITY AND
RESOLUTION OF THE MICROFILM (IN CHINESE).
     
SUCCESSFUL DUPLICATION OF MICROFILMS DEPENDS ON, 2INTER ALIA1, THE DENSITY AND
RESOLUTION OF THE MICROFILMS. COMPARES THE MICROFILMING QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
OF DOCUMENTS CONTAINING BOTH CHINESE CHARACTERS AND ROMAN LETTERS AND
DOCUMENTS CONTAINING ROMAN LETTERS ONLY.
THE RESOLUTION POWER OF MICROFILMS (IN CHINESE).
     
IN ORDER TO HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INFLUENCE OF RESOLUTION POWER
ON MICROFILMS, DESCRIBES THE DETERMINING METHODS OF RESOLUTION POWER FOR FILM
MANUFACTURING AND USER'S APPLICATION. THE EXPRESSION OF RESOLUTION POWER BY
LINES PER MIN IS SOMETIMES CONFUSING, SO THE METHOD READABLE BY THE PATTERN
FROM THE NBS RESOLUTION TEST CHART 1010A REGARDLESS OF THE REDUCTION RATIO HAS
BEEN INTRODUCED. FURTHERMORE, USING THE QUALITY INDEX CHART, IT IS POSSIBLE TO
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESOLUTION POWER REQUIRED TO MICROFILM
THE ORIGINALS CONTAINING ONLY ROMANIC LETTERS AND THOSE CONTAINING CHINESE
CHARACTERS, WHICH ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED IN STRUCTURE.
WHEN MONEY IS SCARCE CULTURAL LIFE MUST GROW.
     
INTERVIEWS INGAR BECKMAN-HIRSCHFELDT, CHAIRMAN OF THE SWEDISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIANS' UNION (SFF) IN CONNECTION WITH A CAMPAIGN ORGANISED BY DIK
(DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION, CULTURE), AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION OF 8
ASSOCIATIONS, OF WHICH SFF IS A MEMBER. THE CAMPAIGN AIMS TO PUT PRESSURE ON
POLITICIANS UP TO THE TIME OF LOCAL AND GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1982 AND
DEMONSTRATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CUTS; A DISCUSSION BOOK DESCRIBING THE PRESENT
STATE OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND STATING ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD GIVE
HIGHER PRIORITY TO CULTURE IS TO BE PUBLISHED. PUBLIC OPINION IS TO BE
MOBILISED AND A CULTURAL PROGRAMME FOR DIK DRAWN UP. ALTHOUGH NO SECTION OF
THE CAMPAIGN IS AIMED SPECIFICALLY AT LIBRARIES, DEMAND FOR A LIBRARY LAW TO
ENSURE REASONABLE AND UNIFORM STANDARDS WILL BE MADE. CUTS IN CULTURAL
SERVICES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO DIK AND LIBRARIANS ARE URGED NOT TO COOPERATE IN
SUGGESTING CUTS IN SERVICES AND MANPOWER. SFF EXPECTS LITTLE FROM THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY COMMISSION, ON WHICH IT IS NOT REPRESENTED.
AN ANALYSIS OF THE METHODS USED TO CONVEY INFORMATION ON COMPLEX BIOCHEMICAL
STRUCTURES, BY REPRESENTATIONS AND CODING SYSTEMS.
     
(MSC THESIS.) REPRESENTATIONS ARE VITAL FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF PROTEIN
STRUCTURAL INFORMATION. THESE REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO
BIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE, AND VARY IN COMPLEXITY AND METHOD OF PRODUCTION. MANY
TYPES OF REPRESENTATION ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY DOCUMENT A PROTEIN STRUCTURE.
INVESTIGATES THE PRIMARY LITERATURE OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE, AND THE METHODS USED
BY BIOCHEMICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA BASES IN HANDLING PROTEIN STRUCTURES.
EXPLORES ASPECTS OF NOMENCLATURE OF PROTEINS AND CODING SYSTEMS FOR PROTEINS,
AND THE SUITABILITY OF NOERR STRUCTURES FOR STORING BIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE.
REGISTRATION OF HUNGARIAN DRUGS, ITS UTILITY FOR THEIR REGISTRATION IN FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.
     
THERAPEUTIC VALUE AND SIDE-EFFECTS OF, AND NECESSITY FOR DRUGS IN HUNGARY ARE
SUPERVISED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PHARMACY, WITH CIRCULATION AUTHORISED
BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH. REGISTRATION IS CARRIED OUT BY THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE, WHICH ALSO DETERMINES THE QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRODUCT
AND CONFIRMS THE FACTORY'S USE AND DOSAGE INSTRUCTIONS. DRUG DOCUMENTATION IS
HANDED OVER AFTER PRECLINICAL AND CLINICO-PHARMACOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS, AND
INCLUDES ANTECEDENTS OF THE ACTIVE AGENTS AND VEHICLES, AND DATA ON TOXICITY,
AND CARCINOGENIC AND MUTAGENOUS PROPERTIES. REGISTRATION IS AN IMPORTANT
FACTOR FOR EXPORT-MOST COUNTRIES REGISTER HUNGARIAN DRUGS ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED ALREADY IN HUNGARY. FOREIGN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CIRCULATION OF
A DRUG REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE ON REGISTRATION PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE PARTNER
COUNTRIES.
THE EVOLUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC COMMUNITY.
     
CONTENDS THAT THE PRESENT FAR-REACHING SCOPE AND VARIETY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND
LIBRARY ACTIVITY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AS MANIFESTED IN THE WORK OF MANY
DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION, ARE POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE OF
THE EMERGENCE AFTER WORLD WAR I OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHICH DID NOT
PREVIOUSLY EXIST. SUGGESTS WHY, IN THE PROFESSION OF LIBRARIANSHIP, THE LEAGUE
OF NATIONS ORGANIZATION FOR INTELLECTUAL COOPERATION BECAME THE SYMBOL OF AND
CENTRE FOR THIS COMMUNITY RATHER THAN THE PALAIS MONDIAL OR MUNDANEUM, CREATED
BY PAUL OTLET AND HENRI LAFONTAINE IN BRUSSELS OVER 20 YEARS BEFORE.
THE NATIONWIDE PROVISION AND USE OF INFORMATION: ASLIB/IIS/LA.

REPORTS ON THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING IN KIRUNA, JUNE
81. LIBRARIES WERE ACCUSED OF FIXATING ON LOAN FIGURES AND NEGLECTING QUALITY.
PROTESTS AGAINST CUTS IN LIBRARY EXPENDITURE AND CALLS FOR A LIBRARY LAW HAVE
COME FROM PUBLISHERS, AUTHORS AND TRADE UNIONS, AS WELL AS LIBRARIANS. BUT THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION'S REMIT DOES NOT INCLUDE PROPOSALS FOR A LAW, NOR
MAY IT RECOMMEND ACTION WHICH INVOLVES FURTHER EXPENDITURE. IT IS FOREMOST AN
EXAMINATION OF THE STATUS QUO. IT HOPES TO DRAW ON THE FINDINGS OF THE DALA
PROJECT, A LITERATURE CAMPAIGN STARTING IN AUTUMN 81. AN ACCOUNT OF THE
VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION'S WORK WAS GIVEN; STRESS WAS LAID ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS
OF VIDEO, SUCH AS GREATER AVAILABILITY OF RARE AND UNPOPULAR FILMS AND AIDS
FOR MINORITIES. A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK FOR SERIOUS VIDEO PRODUCTION INVOLVING
LIBRARIES WAS CALLED FOR. A RESOLUTION AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF LENDING
FEES AND FOR A LIBRARY LAW WAS REJECTED AS UNANI MITY AMONG REPRESENTATIVES
WAS LACKING.
ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
IN THE 1980S, BULGARIAN LIBRARIES MUST MEET THE COMMUNIST PARTY REQUIREMENTS
TO BECOME IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS NOT ONLY TO THE COUNTRY'S TECHNOLOGICAL
PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO THE POPULATION'S AESTHETIC EDUCATION. TO BECOME EQUAL
PARTNERS IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES HAVE TO
REASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR, AND THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND COORDINATION IN RESPECT OF BUILDING UP THEIR BOOK COLLECTIONS. ACQUISITION
OF PUBLICATIONS AND PERIODICALS FROM THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES MUST, IN
PARTICULAR, BE PLANNED VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LIBRARIES MUST CONSIDER AS THE 1ST AND FOREMOST
DUTY THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE USSR
AND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FROM WHICH PUBLICATIONS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING MUST BE BACKED UP AND EXPEDITED BY EFFICIENT TELEX AND
PHOTOCOPYING SERVICES. WELL-KEPT B IBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES NOT ONLY HAVE
INFORMATION VALUE BUT THEY ALSO HELP IN ATTRACTING NEW READERS.

FROM RESEARCH TO PRACTICE. MARGINAL NOTES ON THE RESULTS OF THE LIBRARIANSHIP
RESEARCH PROGRAMME FOR 1976-1980.
     
THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION FORMERLY ELABORATED A
MIDDLE-RANGE RESEARCH PROGRAMME FOR HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES DURING 1976-80. THIS
STUDY ASSESSES TO WHAT EXTENT THE PROGRAMME HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE MOST
ACTIVE AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN IN THE FIELD OF READING RESEARCH AND
INVESTIGATIONS PRECEDING THE INTRODUCTION OF MECHANISED INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH HAVE BEEN IN THE COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT FIELD AND EXPLORATION OF WRITTEN DOCUMENTS OF THE HUNGARIAN
CULTURE. FINALLY, THE STUDY MAKES PROPOSALS FOR TRANSLATION OR ADAPTATION TO
HUNGARIAN CIRCUMSTANCES OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL REFERENCE BOOKS PUBLISHED ABROAD
ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ORDER TO SYNTHESISE CURRENT
KNOWLEDGE FOR PRACTICE AND EDUCATION.
THE CONTENT AND ORGANISATION OF RESEARCH (EARLY RESULTS FROM THE FIRST 10
YEARS).
     
SOVIET LIBRARIES HAVE SEEN A 25% INCREASE IN USAGE OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.
THIS EXPANSION HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH
INTO LIBRARIANSHIP. RESOURCES HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED ON THE STUDY OF SOME OF
THE VERY REAL PROBLEMS OF LIBRARY GROWTH (THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF LIBRARIES,
WAYS OF IMPROVING BOTH IDEOLOGICAL AND INFORMATION WORK, ORGANISING LIBRARY
SYSTEMS ON THE BASES OF CENTRALISATION AND COOPERATION), THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
AND PLACES INVOLVED IN RESEARCH HAS INCREASED AND THE SYSTEM OF DIRECTING
RESEARCH HAS CHANGED WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF STATE CONTROL AND THE
COORDINATION OF LONGTERM PLANNING.
REFLECTIONS OF A BLACK LIBRARIAN.
     
THE AUTHOR WAS RECRUITED INTO THE US LIBRARY PROFESSION IN THE 1950S BECAUSE
OF AN EXPRESSED NEED FOR MORE BLACK MALE LIBRARIANS. HE DECIDED TO WORK IN
BLACK ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE HE FELT HIS EXPERTISE WAS NEEDED THERE.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS COMPELLED HIM TO GIVE
QUALITY LIBRARY SERVICE WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CLAIMS THAT BECAUSE
OF THIS BLACK LIBRARIANS HAVE TO BE TWICE AS GOOD. DISCUSSES THE UNIQUE ROLE
OF BLACK LIBRARIANS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND THE HURDLES THEY MUST
CONQUER.
HE BOUGHT 100 BOTTLES OF RED WINE AND WENT HOME AND BURIED HIMSELF IN
DICKENS'S COLLECTED WORKS.
     
A PORTRAIT OF KNUD LARSEN, 1895-1981. AFTER GRADUATING IN THEOLOGY FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, HE OBTAINED EMPLOYMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL HIGH
SCHOOL'S LIBRARY AND DEVELOPED IT FROM A COLLECTION OF BOOKS ON COMMERCE INTO
A MODERN RESEARCH LIBRARY WITH 36,000 VOLUMES AND A STAFF OF 11 IN 1962. APART
FROM LITERARY AND THEOLOGICAL WORKS HE WROTE HANDBOOKS FOR STUDENTS IN LIBRARY
USE AND, WHILE ATTACHED TO UNESCO IN PARIS IN 1948-9, HIS MAIN WORK' 2NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES, THEIR CREATION AND OPERATION. 1AT THE AGE OF 67,
LARSEN WENT TO UGANDA TO CREATE THE EAST AFRICAN LIBRARY SCHOOL AT THE
MAKERERE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE. HIS LAST WORK FOR INTERNATIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP WAS
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNESCO COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP AT THE DANISH LIBRARY
SCHOOL IN 1966, 68, AND 70.
CLARENCE E. WALTON AND THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES.
     
THE CONTRIBUTION OF CLARENCE E. WALTON, ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN AT HARVARD
UNIVERSITY IN THE 30S AND 40S, TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY
ARCHIVES AND TO THE FIELD OF ARCHIVES GENERALLY IS REVIEWED.
JUSTIN WINSOR' SCHOLAR-LIBRARIAN.
     
TRACES THE CAREER OF JUSTIN WINSOR, WHO DIED IN 1897 WHILE SERVING HIS 9TH
TERM AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. HE WAS PRAISED FOR HIS
MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PRACTICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP. PART I DEALS WITH WINSOR'S LIFE AND CAREER WHICH INCLUDED THE
POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY, AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE
FOUNDING OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND SCHOLAR-LIBRARIAN AT HARVARD
UNIVERSITY. PART II LISTS SELECTED WRITINGS OF WINSOR ON THE TOPICS; PUBLIC
LIBRARIES, PROFESSIONALISM, ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND THE SCHOLARS CRAFT. PART
III IS A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WINSOR'S PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED WORKS AND
SECONDARY PUBLICATIONS.
THE KATHOLIEK LITERATUUR CENTRUM (CATHOLIC LITERATURE CENTRE) IN A HISTORICAL
MOVEMENT.
     
THE CATHOLIC LITERATURE CENTRE IN THE NETHERLANDS WAS CREATED IN 1971 FROM THE
KATHOLIEK BIBLIOTHEEK EN LECTUUR CENTRUM (CATHOLIC LIBRARY AND LITERATURE
CENTRE). THE KBLC ITSELF WAS FORMED IN 1968 BY THE FUSION OF SEVERAL OLDER
ORGANISATIONS, INCLUDING THE BOND VAN ROOMS-KATHOLIEKE OPENBARE LEESZALEN EN
BOEKERIJEN (ASSOCIATION OF ROMAN CATHOLIC PUBLIC READING ROOMS AND LIBRARIES)
AND THE KATHOLIEKE CENTRALE VERENIGING VOOR LECTUURVOORZIENING (CATHOLIC
CENTRAL SOCIETY FOR LITERATURE PROVISION). AS AN EXTRAORDINARY MEMBER OF THE
NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND
LITERATURE) THE CENTRE AIMS TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
IN PUBLIC LIBRARY AFFAIRS AND IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED TO PROMOTE THE INTERESTS
OF CHRISTIAN ORGANISATIONS, SUCH AS THE INTERDENOMINATIONAL PEACE COUNCIL, PAX
CHRISTI AND THE CENTRAL COMMISSION FOR MISSIONARY WORK THROUGH PUBLIC LIB
RARIES.
THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
DESCRIBES PRINCIPLES OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS GUIDES FOR ACTION BY LIBRARIANS WHICH
SHOULD APPLY TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES AND SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY THE
PASSAGE OF TIME OR TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. DISCUSSES 2 MAIN PRINCIPLES'
LIBRARIES ARE FOR USERS; AND LIBRARIES HAVE TO BE PAID FOR; AND MENTIONS
SEVERAL OTHERS. PART 2 DEALS WITH THE APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES; TO THE
SCIENCE REFERENCE LIBRARY, THE NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY, AND TO THE STAFFING
OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY RECORDS. IN CONCLUSION DISCUSSES THE REASONS WHY
THESE PRINCIPLES ARE RARELY USED AND SUGGESTS FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS.
CAN WE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IN THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF ARCHIVES AND RECORDS
MANAGEMENT IN NORTH AMERICA?.
     
ARGUES THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF RECORDS AND ARCHIVES ARE 2 DISTINCT OCCUPATIONS,
AND NOT 2 SPECIALIST BRANCHES OF THE ARCHIVE PROFESSION. ACKNOWLEDGES THE
DESIRABILITY OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE 2, AND EXAMINES THE CONTRIBUTION OF
EACH DEPARTMENT TO THE OTHER, BUT CONCLUDES THAT THE ATTEMPT TO ANNEX THE
FIELD OF RECORDS MANAGEMENT TO ARCHIVE ADMINISTRATION IS ULTIMATELY AN ATTEMPT
TO CREATE A MODERN IMAGE FOR THE PROFESSION BY IMPORTING EUROPEAN TERMINOLOGY
INAPPROPRIATE TO THE NORTH AMERICAN ACTUALITY.
SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS AND YOUTHFUL PURITY' LITERARY AND MORAL
CENSORSHIP, THEN AND NOW.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THOUGH SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
BELIEVE CENSORSHIP IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, IT HAS BEEN A PART OF LIBRARIANS'
LIVES FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. INDEED, MANY LATE-19TH CENTURY LIBRARIANS
REGARDED THEMSELVES PRIMARILY AS CENSORS, DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROM
SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY FICTION. SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
TODAY CARRY ON THIS CENSORIAL TRADITION BY CIRCULATING OR TEACHING ONLY WORKS
OF HIGH LITERARY MERIT OR THE PROPER MORAL CONTENT. THOSE CENSORING ON
LITERARY GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP
BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL TASTES. THOSE CENSORING ON MORAL GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE
NO BETTER CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL MORALITY. LIBR
ARIANS AND TEACHERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE PERSONAL LITERARY OR MORAL
STANDARDS ON THE PUBLIC, YOUNG OR OLD. THEY HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE MATERIALS
OF ALL SORTS TO ALLOW CLIENTS AND STUDENTS TO SEARCH THROUGH AND SEEK OUT
IDEAS.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS.
     
SOME BASIC CONCEPTS CONCERNING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE DEFINED AND
INVESTIGATED. WITH EVERY INFORMATION SYSTEM A QUERY LANGUAGE IS ASSOCIATED AND
ITS SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS IS FORMALLY DEFINED. SOME ELEMENTARY PROPERTIES OF
THE QUERY LANGUAGE ARE STATED. THE PRESENTED APPROACH LEADS TO A NEW
INFORMATION SYSTEMS ORGANISATION.
MEMEX' AS AN IMAGE OF POTENTIALITY IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT.I
     
N 1945, VANNEVAR BUSH WROTE AN ARTICLE URGING SCIENTISTS TO TURN TO THE TASK
OF MAKING THE GROWING STORE OF KNOWLEDGE MORE ACCESSIBLE. (AS WE MAY THINK,
2ATLANTIC MONTHLY1 176 (1) 101-108). ONE DEVICE IN PARTICULAR WHICH HE URGED
FOR DEVELOPMENT WAS THE MEMEX-'A MACHINE THAT SHOULD BE AN EXTENSION OF THE
PERSONAL MEMORY AND BODY OF KNOWLEDGE BELONGING TO AN INDIVIDUAL, AND SHOULD
WORK IN A FASHION ANALOGOUS TO THE WORKING OF THE HUMAN BRAIN-BY ASSOCIATION
RATHER THAN BY CATEGORICAL CLASSIFICATION'. ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF BUSH'S
IDEAS ON THE FIELD OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THE 1945 ARTICLE HAS BEEN WIDELY CITED AND HAS BEEN USED
AS A SYMBOL FOR A NUMBER OF CONCEPTS.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE SCIENCE OF INFORMATION.
     
IN DEALING WITH THEORIES OF INFORMATION RATHER THAN OF DOCUMENTATION, ONE
NEEDS TO USE THE SAME LOGARITHMIC MEASURES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AS ARE
USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERNAL INFORMATION PROCESSES OF THE COMPUTER.
ONE WOULD THEN BE DEALING WITH INFORMATION OBJECTIVELY THROUGHOUT, RATHER THAN
A MIX OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEASURES. INFORMATION 2PER SE1 IS AN EMPTY
CONCEPT. MAN NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO RELATE INFORMATION MORE DIRECTLY TO
KNOWLEDGE, AS A 1ST STEP OBSERVING THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES IN
COMPACT FIELDS OF SCIENCE. A FIRMER METAPHYSIC FOR SUCH STUDIES IS NEEDED.
GOVERNMENTS COME AND GO-ALA REMAINS.
     
DESCRIBES THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1876 AND HAS
35,000 MEMBERS IN THE USA AND CANADA. ITS MEMBERS ARE MAINLY INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIANS, BUT ALSO LIBRARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS. ITS
PUBLICATIONS ILLUSTRATE THE WIDE COVERAGE OF ITS ACTIVITIES' CATALOGUING
RULES, LIBRARY PLANNING, EDUCATION, AUTOMATION, PR MATERIAL. IT DOES NOT ACT
AS A TRADITIONAL TRADE UNION, BUT THE PRESSURE ON ITS OFFICE FOR LIBRARY
PERSONNEL RESOURCES TO TAKE UP THE MATTER OF UNEQUAL PAY IS STRONG, ESPECIALLY
FROM YOUNGER WOMEN, AND THE OFFICE IS NOW PUBLISHING ANNUAL SURVEYS OF
SALARIES. IN LINE WITH THIS, THE ALA IS BOYCOTTING STATES WHO HAVE NOT
RATIFIED THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT, A DECISION WHICH HAS CAUSED FRICTION IN
THE ASSOCIATION. ALTHOUGH THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS MEANT CUTS FOR
LIBRARIES, THE ALA IS CONFIDENT THAT IT CAN RIDE THE STORM.

A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE MALAWI LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, DESCRIBING
THE 1ST MEETINGS IN 1975, THE ELECTION OF A STEERING COMMITTEE AND THE
INAUGURATION AT CHANCELLOR COLLEGE ON 30 APR 76 WITH RODERICK MABOMBA AS
CHAIRMAN AND DR. H. KANUZU BANDA AS PATRON. TOUCHES ON MORE RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS.
LIBRARY SKILLS.
     
THIS WORKBOOK DESIGNED FOR A BASIC LIBRARY SKILLS COURSE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
MISSOURI ALSO SERVES AS A COMPONENT FOR OTHER LIBRARY USE AND RESEARCH
COURSES. IT IS STRUCTURED TO INTRODUCE THE STUDENT TO THE EFFICIENT AND
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE LIBRARIES AND THEIR RESOURCES AND TO PROVIDE ELEMENTARY
INSTRUCTION IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
AN INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION.
     
DESCRIBES A PROPOSED INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION WHICH WOULD
ESTABLISH A BASE FOR THE EFFECTIVE PLANNING AND COORDINATION OF WORLD WIDE
ACTIVITIES IN AND RELATED TO THE EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION
SPECIALISTS. THIS STRUCTURE IS CENTRED ON A COORDINATING COUNCIL (CC) AND A
STANDING CONFERENCE OF LIBRARY EDUCATORS (SC). DISCUSSES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL
ACTIVITIES OF THESE BODIES WHICH INCLUDE; THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LIBRARY
SCHOOLS; IMPROVEMENT OF NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES; PUBLISHING; APPRAISAL AND
CERTIFICATION OF PROGRAMMES; AND PROMOTION OF TEACHING METHODOLOGY.
THE CHANCES OF A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNICATION
SCIENCES FOR LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN BERLIN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL IS NOW COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO THE UNIVERSITY
AS PART OF THE COMMUNICATION SCIENCE FACULTY, THE 1ST TIME THAT THIS HAS
OCCURRED IN GERMANY. OBJECTIONS TO UNIVERSITY STATUS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES
WERE FORMERLY MADE ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES OCCUPY ONLY 6
SEMESTERS WHERE OTHER UNIVERSITY COURSES REQUIRE 8 OR 9 AND THAT A UNIVERSITY
COURSE WOULD PROVIDE INADEQUATE PRACTICAL TRAINING. IF LIBRARIANSHIP IS TO BE
REGARDED AS PART OF COMMUNICATION SCIENCE NEW THEORETIC FIELDS MUST BE
DEVELOPED WHICH WILL AFFECT LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING. LIBRARIANS MUST BE TRAINED
IN CRITICAL MEDIA SELECTION AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION; IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIANSHIP PERSONAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS MUST BE
IMPROVED TO COUNTERACT THE IMPERSONAL EFFECTS OF INCREASING CENTRALISATION.
LIBRARIANS NEED A BETTER GENERAL EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CONNECTED ACADEMIC
SUBJECTS LIKE SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY.
STATE OF THE ART IN LIBRARY TRAINING AND EXTENSION TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS.
     
AN ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE PROPOSALS PREPARED BY A WORKING COMMITTEE OF THE
HUNGARIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARIES RELATING TO THE CONTENT, ORGANISATIONAL AND
QUANTITATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY TRAINING, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS NOT KEPT
PACE WITH THE INCREASE IN STAFF NUMBERS WORKING IN THE FIELD NOR WITH THE
DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY FOR BOTH THE LIBRARIAN AND THE
INFORMATION SPECIALIST.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INDIA.
     
MAKES A CRITICAL STUDY OF LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATION IN INDIA AND THE USA.
REVEALS THAT THE COURSE CONTENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IN US LIBRARY SCHOOLS IS
COMPARABLE TO THAT OF INDIAN LIBRARY SCHOOLS. REVIEWS AND COMPARES THE VARIOUS
COURSES THAT ARE OFFERED IN THE 2 COUNTRIES. ANALYSES THE ROLES OF THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION IN PROMOTING
LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE US AND INDIA RESPECTIVELY.
LIBRARY EDUCATION FROM 3 PERSPECTIVES' COGNITIVE, CYBERNETIC, AND
DEVELOPMENTAL.
     
LIBRARY EDUCATION HAS BEEN PART OF THE US HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM SINCE 1870.
IT REMAINED POPULAR UNTIL WORLD WAR II AND THEN THERE WAS A SUDDEN DROP IN
POPULARITY. IT WAS REVIVED ONLY IN THE LATE 1950S AND EARLY 60S. ANALYSES THE
LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMME IN TERMS OF LEARNING, TEACHING, CURRICULUM AND
EVALUATION FROM COGNITIVE, CYBERNETIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVES.
DISCUSSES A 3 PART PROGRAMME WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED SUCESSFULLY
AT COLGATE UNIVERSITY. PROGRAMMES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF DENVER ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. THE EXPERIENCE
OF LIBRARIANS IS THAT IT IS EASY FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN THE BROADER CONCEPTS OF
THE USAGE OF THE LIBRARY AND DO RESEARCH, RATHER THAN REMEMBER MANY TITLES FOR
EACH SUBJECT OF THEIR RESEARCH.
SOME PROBLEMS WITH PART-TIME COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
IN ADDITION TO FULLTIME COURSES OFFERED BY THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN
SOFIA, PART-TIME COURSES, I.E. IN-SERVICE COURSES, HELP TO INCREASE THE NUMBER
OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS. FROM 1960 TO 1976, 936 PART-TIME STUDENTS ENROLLED,
AND 834, I.E. 89%, COMPLETED THEIR STUDIES INCLUDING 16 STUDENTS FROM THE
CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY. 99% OF THE STUDENTS WERE WOMEN, WHO WERE
FORCED FREQUENTLY TO EXTEND THEIR STUDIES BEYOND 3 YEARS BECAUSE OF MATERNITY
LEAVE, ILLNESS AND OTHER REASONS. IN FUTURE, THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, IN
PARTICULAR, MUST HELP TO SELECT SUITABLE CANDIDATES AS PROSPECTIVE PART-TIME
STUDENTS. LIBRARIES ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO INTENSIFY THEIR ASSISTANCE TO ENROLLED
PART-TIME STUDENTS, PROVIDE HELP DURING THE COURSE AS WELL AS TO ASSIST THOSE
STUDENTS WHO ARE PREPARING FOR FINAL EXAMINATIONS AND THESES. ONLY THEN CAN
PART-TIME COURSES GRADUALLY BECOME AN EQUIVALENT TO FULLTIME STUDY.
A STUDY OF CONTINUING EDUCATION ACTIVITIES OF THREE NATIONAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS.
     
REPORTS FINDINGS ON EXISTING CONTINUING LIBRARY EDUCATION AND EXPLORES THE
SCOPE AND FUNCTION OF CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMMES OFFERED TO LIBRARY

OPTIMIZING SELECTION OF LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENTS.
     
ATTEMPTS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS GRADE
POINT AVERAGE, GRE TEST SCORES, PERSONAL REFERENCES, WORK EXPERIENCE AND
PERSONAL GOALS STATEMENTS IN PREDICTING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN SPECIFIC
LIBRARY SCIENCE CLASSES AND THROUGHOUT A LIBRARY SCHOOL MASTER'S DEGREE
PROGRAMME. SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS WHICH PREDICT PERFORMANCE BEST ARE
DIFFERENT FOR EACH CLASS, BUT PREVIOUS GRADE POINT AVERAGE AND THE GRE
QUANTITATIVE TEST SCORE PREDICT OVERALL STUDENT PERFORMANCE BETTER THAN ANY
OTHER TEST VARIABLES.

TRAINING INFORMATION SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS.
     
DISCUSSES ISSUES RAISED IN CURRICULUM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT FOR A
POSTGRADUATE COURSE IN INFORMATION SCIENCE. CONSIDERS INFORMATION SCIENCE AS
AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SUBJECT AREA CONCERNED WITH THE EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION
OF ITS SUBSTANTIVE NUCLEUS, INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, TEACHING PROGRAMMES ARE
REQUIRED TO COVER BOTH ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION, WITH
THE CURRICULUM ITSELF SERVING AS A MODEL OF EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION. THE
QUESTION THEN NECESSARILY ARISES WHETHER COURSES SHOULD BE ORIENTED TOWARDS
INSTILLING THE EXISTING CORPUS OF COGNITIVE INFORMATION, OR IN DEVELOPING
CAPABILITIES FOR DEALING WITH PRESENT AND FUTURE NEEDS. WHEREAS ACADEMIC
TRAINING EMPHASISES THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING REQUIRES
PREPARATION FOR DECISION MAKING. PROPOSES IN CONCLUSION A MODEL OF CURRICULUM
ORGANISATION ENCOMPASSING BOTH THEORY AND APPLICATION.
THE BLAISE/MARC FILES' AN INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR USE AND VALUE IN TEACHING.
     
DESCRIBES RESEARCH ON THE USE OF THE BLAISE/MARC FILES IN TEACHING STUDENTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND
CATALOGUING. THE FACILITIES OFFERED BY AN HP2645A TERMINAL WERE INVESTIGATED
IN 2 WAYS' (1) BY USING THE TERMINAL TO ACCESS THE BLAISE/MARC FILES AND (2)
BY USING THE TERMINAL ON ITS OWN AS A TEACHING TOOL. THE REPORT DISCUSSES THE
PROBLEMS OF USING THE TERMINAL'S RESOURCES, SUCH AS ITS STORAGE, EDITING AND
PROGRAMMING CAPABILITIES. A NUMBER OF CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN INCLUDING THE NEED
FOR BETTER DOCUMENTATION FOR THE TERMINAL, AND FOR USING THE BLAISE/MARC FILES
TO PRODUCE SELF-INSTRUCTIONAL TEACHING PACKAGES FOR STUDENTS.
TRAINING IN ON-LINE CATALOGUING IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING.
     
IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF TRAINING LIBRARY SCHOOL
STUDENTS FOR LATER PERFORMANCE AS ON-LINE CATALOGUERS, EXAMINES THE METHODS OF
SIMULATION, DIAL-UP ACCESS TO ESTABLISHED BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS, AND THE USE
OF A CRT TERMINAL DEDICATED TO ONE SUCH NETWORK. ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM
INDICATED THAT 2 MODES OF TRAINING ARE REQUIRED' DEVELOPMENT OF THE
INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY FOR ORIGINAL CATALOGUING; AND INCULCATION OF
USER-COMPUTER INTERACTIVE FACILITY.
TRAINING TECHNIQUES FOR CHEMICAL SEARCHING ONLINE: CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGNING
A COURSE IN CONTINUING EDUCATION.
     
BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSE
IN 'SEARCHING THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE IN THE HEALTH SCIENCES' FOR THE MEDICAL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ARE DELINEATED. THE INTEREST OF ASSOCIATION MEMBERS IN
SUBJECT-ORIENTED COURSES IN ON-LINE SEARCHING IS DISCUSSED WITH SPECIAL
MENTION OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR ONLINE RETRIEVAL EDUCATION (SCORE) OF
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE. DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND
FACTUAL DATA BASES ARE OUTLINED.
SOURCES FOR THE HISTORY OF CLIMATE.
     
WORK PRESENTED IN 1979 AT A COURSE ON ARCHIVES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL
HISTORY DEPARTMENT. THE 1ST SECTION DETAILS THE POSSIBLE DATA SOURCES'
METEOROLOGICAL READINGS; TREE DATING; HARVEST RECORDS; EMPIRICAL QUALITATIVE
CLIMATE OBSERVATIONS; AND GLACIER STUDIES. THE 2ND SECTION DISCUSSES THE
DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN GATHERING ADEQUATE SCIENTIFIC MATERIALS IN EACH CASE,
AND CONCLUDES BY EMPHASISING THAT THE HISTORY OF CLIMATE IS NECESSARILY AN
INTER-DISCIPLINARY AND COMPARATIVE FIELD WHERE THE ROLE OF THE ARCHIVIST IS
FUNDAMENTAL.
INFORMATION IS POWER: THE LIBRARY AS A RESOURCE.
     
TRANSLATED BY TAMAS VOLGYES. IN A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND STEADILY CHANGING
WORLD, EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND OF ACCUMULATED HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.
OUTLINES THE LACK OF INFORMATION IN SOME AREAS AND THE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE IN
ELIMINATING, OR AT LEAST ALLEVIATING THIS PROBLEM, WITH UP TO DATE SERVICES.
LIBRARY FUNCTIONS MUST BE EXTENDED AND TRAINING DEVELOPED.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE WORLD'S ANCIENT LIBRARIES.

THE ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY, WHICH FLOURISHED OVER 4,000 YEARS AGO. DISCUSSES
THEIR ORIGINS AND ORIGINATORS; DESCRIBES THE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR CONTENTS;
AND ASSESSES HOW MODERN THEIR ORGANISERS WERE IN THEIR THINKING OF THE
PRINCIPLES OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
LEIPZIG-WELL WORTH A VISIT.
     
REPORTS ON A VISIT TO LEIPZIG IN CONNECTION WITH IFLA'S 47TH CONGRESS HELD
THERE IN AUG 81. THE PRESIDENT, ELSE GRANHEIM, STRESSED THAT LIBRARIES ARE
ALSO FOR THE DISABLED AND POINTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF FREE ACCESS TO
INFORMATION. DESCRIBES A VISIT TO A BRANCH LIBRARY IN LEIPZIG. IT WAS WELL
PROVIDED WITH BOOKS, JOURNALS, RECORDS AND REPRODUCTIONS AND HAD ARRANGEMENTS
FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. THERE ARE ABOUT 70 LIBRARIES AT LARGER PLACES OF WORK
UNDER TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP AND ABOUT 280 VOLUNTARY BOOK COLLECTIONS IN
KINDERGARTENS, SCHOOLS, BLOCKS OF FLATS AND SMALLER WORKPLACES. A VISIT WAS
ALSO PAID TO THE ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER DEUTSCHEN KLASSIK IN WEIMAR. IN ALL,
THE AUTHORS FOUND SYMPATHETIC, INQUIRING PEOPLE DESPITE THE OFFICIAL LACK OF
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.
CAMPANIA' ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARY SITUATION.
     
A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING SERVICES IN A SOUTHERN ITALIAN REGION
BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE IN NOV 80, SHOWING THE TOTAL INADEQUACY OF LIBRARY
PROVISION, AND ABSENCE OF ANY OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE
INITIATIVES AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY TO DEVELOP SERVICES AND PROVIDE
TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS. RELIABLE STATISTICS ARE UNAVAILABLE, BUT SUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH IN NAPLES AND THROUGHOUT THE
REGION, THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES ARE RESTRICTED TO UNIVERSITY USERS OR OTHER
PRIVILEGED GROUPS, AND PUBLIC ACCESS TO READING IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. ANY
ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED INITIATIVES, WITHOUT
RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE COMMUNITY;
EXPANSION IS HAPHAZARD AND THE CONCEPTS OF LIBRARY COOPERATION AND NETWORK
PLANNING UTTERLY UNKNOWN. SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE CREATION OF REGIONAL
CENTRES AS A 1ST STEP IN AMELIORATING THE SITUATI ON. A NOTE CALLS ATTENTION
TO THE INCREASED URGENCY FOR ACTION FOLLOWING DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS
BY EARTHQUAKE, AND AN APPENDIX DEALS WITH THE PROBLEMS OF RESCUING ARCHIVES
NOW AT RISK BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE.
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES.
     
THE 12TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY SET IMPORTANT TARGETS IN
RESPECT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE RESULT OF INTENSIVE APPLICATION
OF CHEMISTRY, AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES HAVE
A SIGNIFICANT PART TO PLAY ASSISTING WITH THEIR SERVICES IN IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE TARGETS. THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG SCIENTISTS HAVE A GOOD COMMAND OF AT LEAST
1 WESTERN LANGUAGE AND RUSSIAN LITERATURE IS IN GENERAL USE. HOWEVER, THERE IS
STILL MUCH TO BE DONE TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN
AVOIDING LIBRARIES SO FAR. PERSONAL RAPPORT WITH SUCH PEOPLE IS DECISIVE AND
LIBRARIANS SHOULD DRAW IDEAS FROM INSTRUCTIVE PUBLICATIONS ISSUED FOR THIS
PURPOSE BY MANY CENTRAL LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION TO BOOKS, PERIODICALS, PATENTS,
TRADE CATALOGUES AND SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES HAVE TO BE UTILISED TO THE
FULL. LIBRARIES NEED EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER TO THEIR READERS
INFORMATION ON MICROFORM.
IV INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE WORK OF THE CONGRESS DUE TO BE HELD IN BELGRADE IN SEPTEMBER 1980, AND
ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS ARE SUMMARISED. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

ARE MUSIC LIBRARIES THREATENED BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION?.
     
THE 3RD SCANDINAVIAN MUSIC LIBRARY CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN STOCKHOLM AND
MAARIANHAMINA IN MAY 81. THE PROGRAMME WAS PLANNED BY THE NORDIC IAML SECTION.
50 PEOPLE ATTENDED IN MAARIANHAMINA. THE CONFERENCE DEALT WITH THE EFFECTS OF
RECESSION ON MUSIC LIBRARIES, THE QUALIFICATIONS OF MUSIC LIBRARIANS, AND THE
VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUING RULES FOR MUSIC.
THE STATE CENTRAL THEATRICAL LIBRARY IN THE LIBRARY NETWORK.
     
THE STATE CENTRAL THEATRICAL LIBRARY IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR LIBRARIES IN
MOSCOW AND OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES TO MANY WORKERS IN THE ARTS. ITS
SPECIALISED STOCKS, BUILT UP SINCE 1922, FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE
RESOURCES OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY NETWORK. THERE IS SCOPE, HOWEVER, FOR GREATER
COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, AND
THERE IS A NEED FOR A WHOLE NEW APPROACH TO THE ORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY
BEFORE IT CAN DEVELOP TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.
LIBRARY DESCRIPTION' THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES LIBRARY IN BRUSSELS.
     
THE 1ST LIBRARY SERVING THE STAFF OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES WAS FOUNDED IN
1952 IN LUXEMBURG FOR THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY, FOLLOWED IN 1958
BY THE LIBRARIES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND EURATOM. AFTER THE
REORGANISATION OF THE SEPARATE COMMUNITIES IN 1967 TO FORM THE COMMISSION OF

SERVICES FROM A SURVEY OF 1,134 SPECIAL LIBRARIES SERVING STATE GOVERNMENTS,
PRESENTED BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AND BY 14 TYPES OF STATE LIBRARIES.
THE ROLE OF THE UNION OF YUGOSLAV NATIONAL LIBRARIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
LIBRARIANSHIP IN YUGOSLAVIA.
     
THE UNION OF YUGOSLAV NATIONAL LIBRARIES WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1962 IN ORDER TO
ASSIST THE COOPERATION AND COORDINATION OF WORK OF THE CENTRAL REPUBLICAN
LIBRARIES. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE UNION ARE' DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND
BIBLIOGRAPHY, ORGANISATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SERVICES, AND
COOPERATION WITH NATIONAL LIBRARIES ABROAD AND WITH INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY
ORGANISATIONS. THE UNION HAS AT PRESENT 2 MAIN TASKS' DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED
LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. THE PROGRAMME OF THE UNIFIED SYSTEM IS DISCUSSED
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 6 MAIN POINTS. ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE THE UNION
ACTS AS THE COORDINATOR OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF ITS MEMBER LIBRARIES.
THE BRITISH LIBRARY' PHENOMENON OF THE SEVENTIES OR PROTOTYPE OF NATIONAL
LIBRARY PLANNING.
     
IN ITS LEGISLATION, THE COMPOSITION AND POWERS OF ITS BOARD, AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE
70S AND BEYOND, THE BRITISH LIBRARY MIGHT JUSTIFIABLY BE DEEMED A PROTOTYPE OF
MODERN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLANNING; BUT SINCE IT BEGAN FROM A VANTAGE POINT NOT
ACCESSIBLE TO OTHER EXISTING NATIONAL LIBRARIES IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
(AND BEYOND THE REACH OF THOSE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES), IT MAY BE VIEWED
RATHER AS A PHENOMENON OF THE 70S.
NATIONAL LIBRARY FOR BANGLADESH.
     
TRACES THE ORIGIN OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN BANGLADESH AND REVEALS THAT ITS
GENESIS GOES BACK TO 1961 WHEN BANGLADESH WAS KNOWN AS EAST PAKISTAN.

THE 2ND 5 YEAR PLAN (1980-85). CONCLUDES THAT, ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT
PLANS AND PROGRAMMES, A FUNCTIONAL NATIONAL LIBRARY WILL NOT BE ESTABLISHED
BEFORE 1985.

DURING 1980-81, THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION RECEIVED 2,346,000
REQUESTS FROM THE UK (DOWN BY 1.2%) AND 510,000 FROM ABROAD (DOWN BY 6.3%). AN
EXPERIMENTAL SCHEME OF LENDING BOOKS IN ORIENTAL LANGUAGES (AS A LAST RESORT)
FROM THE REFERENCE DIVISION WAS STARTED. THE 2CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS INDEX1
BECAME AVAILABLE ON-LINE. THE DIVISION RECEIVED 56,000 CURRENT SERIALS (3.7%
INCREASE), 105,000 MONOGRAPHS, AND 200,000 REPORTS. CONSERVATION WAS OF
INCREASING CONCERN. SURVEYS INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF SERIALS USE. DISCUSSIONS
TOOK PLACE WITH PUBLISHERS ON POSSIBLE COOPERATION IN ELECTRONIC STORAGE AND
TRANSMISSION OF JOURNAL ARTICLES.
CULTURE FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE.
     
REPORT ON A VISIT TO CUBA TO STUDY THE CULTURAL CENTRES. A NATIONAL NETWORK OF
SUCH CENTRES IS BEING BUILT BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE'S DEPARTMENT FOR MASS
CULTURE. ACTIVITIES SERVE EDUCATIONAL, RECREATIVE AND IDEOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS.
EACH CENTRE HAS A DIRECTORATE, TECHNICAL COMMITTEE, CONTACT GROUP AND USER
GROUP, AND ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM CREATIVE WORKSHOPS, STUDY GROUPS, LECTURES,
MUSIC FESTIVALS, EXHIBITIONS, AND LIBRARY. THE ACTIVITIES LAID ON IN 1 OF
HAVANA'S CULTURAL CENTRES, THE PLAZA DE LA REVOLUCION, ARE DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL. THE CENTRE'S LIBRARY HAS MAINLY SPECIALISED WORKS NEEDED FOR THE
ACTIVITIES, ALTHOUGH THE CHILDREN'S SECTION HAS A SOMEWHAT BROADER SELECTION.
THE INTENTION IS THAT ALL CUBA'S DISTRICTS SHALL HAVE AS A MINIMUM A CULTURAL
CENTRE, HISTORICAL MUSEUM, PUBLIC LIBRARY, CINEMA, BOOKSHOP, ART SHOP, CHOIR,
ORCHESTRA, THEATRE AND ART GALLERY.
CARNEGIES LIVE.

TO LIBRARIANS TO DESCRIBE THE WAYS IN WHICH THEIR CARNEGIE LIBRARIES HAVE
RESPONDED, OR FAILED TO RESPOND TO CURRENT NEEDS AND PRACTICES. A HISTORICAL
SECTION, FROM GEORGE S. BOBINSKI'S 2CARNEGIE LIBRARIES1 PROVIDES BACKGROUND
MATERIAL ON THE BUILDINGS AND THE MAN BEHIND THEM.
FROM CAXTON TO CASSETTE.
     
EXCERPTS FROM THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL
CONFERENCE, MARGATE, SEPT 81. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE CHANGES IN COMMUNICATION
FROM THE PRINTING OF CAXTON TO THE PRESENT DAY AND SUGGESTS A DEVELOPMENT IN
THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO INCLUDE FUNCTIONS NOW CARRIED OUT BY THE POST
OFFICE, CITIZENS' ADVICE BUREAUX AND CONSUMER ADVICE CENTRES, AND ENCOURAGE
PATRONS TO BUY BOOKS. CRITICISES THE LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR AUTHORS AND
CURRENT OUTPUT FROM UK PUBLISHERS.

GEORGE POMPIDOU AND PUBLIC READING.
     
AN ACCOUNT BY THE FRENCH DIRECTOR OF LIBRARIES FROM 1964 TO 1975, WRITTEN
SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH. DESCRIBES HOW GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, INSTIGATED
CHIEFLY BY POMPIDOU, REVERSED THE DECLINE OF INTEREST IN READING BY THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF A 10-YEAR PLAN OF PUBLIC LIBRARY EXPANSION. THE ARTICLE IS
FOLLOWED BY SHORT TRIBUTES FROM 2 OF THE AUTHOR'S COLLEAGUES.
THE ZERO GROWTH SYNDROME AND THE LIBRARIES' WORK FOR REFORMS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A PANEL DEBATE ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE 80S, ORGANISED BY
THE DANISH LIBRARY INSPECTORATE AND HELD IN OCT 81. LIBRARIES ARE FACED WITH A
SITUATION IN WHICH THEIR USE, ESPECIALLY THAT INVOLVING REFERENCE SERVICES,
GROWS, WHILE DEMANDS FOR CUTS OR ZERO GROWTH ARE MADE. LIBRARIANS HAVE TO GIVE
UP SOME SERVICES, SUCH AS LENGTHY LITERATURE SEARCHES, IN ORDER TO KEEP A
BALANCE IN THE GENERAL SERVICE LEVEL AND ARE FACED WITH AN INVIDIOUS CHOICE
BETWEEN THE KINDS OF MATERIAL-NEWSPAPERS, REFERENCE BOOKS, JOURNALS-WHICH HAVE
TO BE AXED. THERE IS A NEED FOR AN OVERALL PLANNING BODY WHICH CAN DECIDE
PRIORITIES ON PROFESSIONAL GROUNDS. ARGUES FOR STRENGTHENING OF THE REFERENCE
SECTIONS IN SMALLER LIBRARIES BY APPOINTMENT OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS AND FOR
THE FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY TO ALL PUBLICLY OWNED
LIBRARIES. CENTRALLY PRODUCED REFERENCE AIDS HELP IN THE CHOICE OF PRIORITIES
AND FREE STAFF FOR OTHE R TASKS, BUT MORE ARE NEEDED. A PERIOD OF CUTS SHOULD
BE USED TO PLAN FUTURE EXPANSION.
LIBERALISM INCARNATE AND MEDIOCRITY ON THE RAILS.
     
INTERVIEWS THE AUTHOR, PER HOJHOLT, WHO ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES COULD SUPPORT
QUALITY LITERATURE MORE EFFECTIVELY BY ORDERING MORE COPIES OF GOOD BOOKS.
INSTEAD LIBRARIES, GIVING IN TO POPULAR DEMAND, CONTAIN A SURFEIT OF MEDIOCRE
AUTHORS. LOCAL FREEDOM TO SELECT IS LARGELY AN ILLUSION AS IN PRACTICE THE
BINDING CENTRE'S REVIEWS ARE HEAVILY RELIED UPON. THE POPULARITY OF
SOCIOLOGICAL AND WOMEN'S NOVELS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED ENTIRELY, HOWEVER, AS
LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CATER BOTH FOR QUALITY AND TOPICALITY. AUTHORS
OF SCHOOL AND CHILDREN'S BOOKS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF ADULT BOOKS, ON THE
OTHER, SHOULD HAVE THEIR LIBRARY FEES ASSESSED SEPARATELY. THE WORK OF
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS IS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AND THEIR TRAINING SHOULD
REFLECT THIS; LITERARY QUALITY HARDLY APPLIES TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE.
SUGGESTS SALE OF BOOKS IN LIBRARIES TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF THE BOOK TRADE.
A REVIEW OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA.
     
WITH REFERENCE TO THE AUTHOR'S VISITS TO ASIAN COUNTRIES, DISCUSSES PUBLIC

HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BY ONLY 6 OF THE 41 COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. THE COUNTRIES
LACK LIBRARY STANDARDS (EXCEPT FOR A FEW), ADEQUATE FINANCES, PHYSICAL
FACILITIES, AND LIBRARY RESOURCES. SUGGESTS ACTION BY NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS.
IN SEARCH OF CARNEGIE.
     
DISCUSSES A PROJECT UNDERTAKEN IN 1979 WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ONTARIO
HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND THE BRITISH COUNCIL TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF
CARNEGIE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN CANADA. ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE
NUMBER OF CARNEGIE LIBRARIES, HOW COMMUNITIES MANAGED TO GET GRANTS TO BUILD
LIBRARIES AND WHO DESIGNED THE BUILDINGS. VISITS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MANY
LIBRARY BUILDINGS IN CANADA AND THE UK AND ALTHOUGH SOME INFORMATION HAS BEEN
OBTAINED THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE UNTIL AT LEAST 1982.
A LIBRARY IN BRIXTON.
     
DESCRIBES A VISIT TO THE MAIN PUBLIC LIBRARY IN BRIXTON SHORTLY AFTER THE
RIOTS IN 1981. THE CULTURAL CONTRAST BETWEEN LIFE IN THE STREET AND IN THE
LIBRARY WAS STRIKING. BRIXTON SERVES A POPULATION OF ABOUT 90,000, 25% OF WHOM
ARE USERS. THE LIBRARY EMPHASISES OUTREACH SERVICES AND TEAMWORK AMONG THE 20
STAFF EMPLOYED BY THE MAIN AND 2 BRANCH LIBRARIES. THUS THE LIBRARY SERVES
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES, HOSTELS FOR THE HOMELESS, YOUTH
CLUBS, PRISONS. HELP IS GIVEN TO ADVICE CENTRES AND 100 PEOPLE ARE VISITED IN
THEIR HOMES. THE CHILDREN'S SECTION CONTAINED FEW BOOKS AND WAS LITTLE USED.

YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR LEADERS. THE STOCK INCLUDES BOOKS IN MANY FOREIGN
LANGUAGES FOR THE IMMIGRANT MINORITIES.
COVER PICTURE (LIBRARY AT BAD NEUENAHR-AHRWEILER).
     
A DECLINING READERSHIP CAUSED THE LIBRARY AT BAD NEUENAHR-AHRWEILER TO CLOSE
IN 1970. IN 1975 IT WAS REOPENED IN THE TOWN HALL AND PERMANENT ACCOMMODATION

USING 1978 STATISTICAL DATA FROM THE CENTRE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE AND
METHODOLOGY, AN ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN COUNTY LIBRARIES IS MADE. EXAMINES SUCH
LIBRARIES IN TERMS OF SIZE, STAFF NUMBERS, ACQUISITION FUNDS, YEARLY
ACCESSIONING NUMBERS, ENROLLED READERS AND LENDING STATISTICS. ATTEMPTS TO
ASSESS THE ROLE OF COUNTY LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO CITY LIBRARIES AND
EVALUATES THE LEVEL OF PROVISION FOR USERS.

BY THE FRANCO-AMERICAN CULTURAL EXCHANGE COMMISSION. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF
BOSTON PREFACES A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT OF ITS LIBRARY SYSTEM, COMPRISING THE
RESEARCH LIBRARY, GENERAL LIBRARY, AND NETWORK OF BRANCHES. FULL DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF BUILDINGS, STOCK, LAYOUT, SERVICES, AND FINANCE AND PERSONNEL, FOR
ALL 3 CATEGORIES. THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF THE BRANCH SYSTEM IS
DISCUSSED SEPARATELY IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT
THE NETWORK AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF ZONING. THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL
ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL IS OUTLINED, AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRALISED SERVICES
DESCRIBED. FINALLY THE BOSTON SYSTEM IS LOCATED IN ITS WIDER REGIONAL CONTEXT.
CRITICISES UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS ON USERS, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE
EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.
QUO VADIS? FUNDAMENTAL REFLECTIONS ON THE FUTURE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
REVIEWS SOME FACTORS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT THE ROLE AND DEVELOPMENT OF
ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES DURING THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. DISCUSSES' THE
IMPROVEMENT OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE CONTEXT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND
MATERIALS; RESOURCE SHARING THROUGH INFORMAL COOPERATION AND THROUGH NETWORKS;
THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY; AND THE EFFECTS OF NEW
DEVELOPMENTS ON COLLECTION GROWTH AND MANAGEMENT AND ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF
THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WITH THE PARENT BODY AND WITH OTHER LIBRARIES. MAKES
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR' INCREASED ACCESS TO LIBRARY HOLDINGS THROUGH DISTRIBUTED
NETWORKS; THE IMPROVEMENT OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN; THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
COOPERATIVE COLLECTION MANAGEMENT; A REAPPRAISAL OF COLLECTION EVALUATION
CRITERIA; AND THE APPROPRIATE UTILISATION OF MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY.
UNIVERSITY OF DAR ES SALAAM LIBRARY.
     
THE UNIVERSITY OF DAR-ES-SALAAM LIBRARY SERVES SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF READERS
REGULARLY. THE LIBRARY ACQUIRES ABOUT 10,000 DOCUMENTS PER YEAR. THE PROBLEMS
THE LIBRARY IS FACING ARE MANY AND VARIED. HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND
DESCRIBES SOME MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO SOLVE THEM. THE SERVICES,
CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION PROCEDURES OF THE LIBRARY ARE DESCRIBED.

TOWN LIBRARIES FROM THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY IN 1955 (CELEBRATED IN 1956) TO 1965.
UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY & U.C.T. LIBRARIES: A FEW BRIEF COMPARISONS.
     
COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE 2 LIBRARIES CENTRE ON CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, STAFFING,
PERIODICALS AND MICROFORMS. CONCLUDES THAT AFTER A MERE 22 YEARS EXISTENCE THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY LIBRARY HAS ALREADY OVERTAKEN THE 75 YEAR OLD UNIVERSITY
OF CAPE TOWN LIBRARY IN TERMS OF FACILITIES, STOCK AND EQUIPMENT.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' STANDARDS AND STATISTICS.
     
THE ARL-ACRL STANDARDS FOR UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DO NOT PRESENT QUANTITATIVE
STANDARDS, BUT RATHER PLACE THEIR EMPHASIS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES. THROUGH THE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CORRELATION AND REGRESSION,
DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS, AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS IT IS POSSIBLE TO
ANALYSE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DATA AND TO DERIVE MINIMAL CRITERIA THAT
STATISTICALLY DISTINGUISH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER KINDS OF ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES. THESE CRITERIA LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE STANDARDS, BUT STILL FAIL TO
RELATE LIBRARY SIZE AND RESOURCES DEPLOYED TO LIBRARY PERFORMANCE.
DEGREE COLLEGE LIBRARIES IN KASHMIR' A SURVEY.
     
PRESENTS THE OVERALL PICTURE OF THE DEGREE COLLEGE LIBRARIES OF KASHMIR.
POINTS OUT CERTAIN FACTORS REQUIRING CONSIDERATION AND SUGGESTS CERTAIN
MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE STANDARDS OF COLLEGE LIBRARY SERVICES IN KASHMIR.
BOOKS HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINY; ABOUT THE PARIS LIBRARY OF I.S. TURGENEV.
     
THE FATE OF I.S. TURGENEV'S PARIS LIBRARY, CONTAINING 3,000 VOLUMES, REMAINS
UNRESOLVED. ONLY 12 VOLUMES DEFINITELY SURVIVE. IN 1897, TURGENEV'S
COMPATRIOTS ASKED HIS HEIRESS, POLINA VIARDOT TO DONATE BOOKS FROM TURGENEV'S
PARIS LIBRARY TO THE ORLOVSK PROVINCIAL MUSEUM. SHE DENIED POSSESSING THE
LIBRARY. TURGENEV HAD 1643 RUSSIAN BOOKS IN PARIS, 816 GERMAN, 147 ENGLISH AND
246 FRENCH. A NOTE IN A TURGENEV EX-LIBRIS MENTIONS HIS RUSSIAN BOOKS WERE
SOLD IN LEIPZIG. OCCASIONALLY TURGENEV'S BOOKS RETURN FROM OBLIVION AND ARRIVE
IN THE ORLOV I.S. TURGENEV MUSEUM. THE SURVIVING BOOKS FROM TURGENEV'S PARIS
LIBRARY ARE MULTIFARIOUS, BUT ALL ASSOCIATED WITH HIS CIRCLE AND STUDIES.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED.
     
DESCRIBES LIBRARY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE HANDICAPPED IN EUROPE, THE U.S.A.,
AND CANADA, EXCLUDING QUEBEC. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND,
LEGISLATION, AND NOTABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE VENTURES. THE DISCUSSION IS
DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS, DEALING RESPECTIVELY WITH HOSPITAL SERVICES,
DOMICILIARY SERVICES, AND SERVICES FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED, THE MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED, AND THE DEAF. THE SURVEY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
MENTALLY HANDICAPPED AND THE DEAF ARE THE MOST NEGLECTED GROUPS. THE
IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY INITIATIVES, ESPECIALLY IN THE U.S.A. AND CANADA,
IS EMPHASISED, IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES IN QUEBEC, WHERE
LIBRARIANS ARE NOT PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED.
IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE' CONTACT BETWEEN BONN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY AND THE
HANDICAPPED.
     
THE LIBRARY LOANS BOOKS TO AND COMPILES BOOK-LISTS FOR A REHABILITATION CENTRE
FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND VARIOUS CLUBS WITH BOTH HANDICAPPED AND
NON-HANDICAPPED MEMBERS. CHILDREN FROM A LOCAL KINDERGARTEN FOR BOTH
HANDICAPPED AND NON-HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, HOPEFULLY A BASIS FOR FUTURE MIXED
SCHOOL CLASSES, VISIT THE LIBRARY REGULARLY. THE LOCAL SCHOOL FOR THE
PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED BRINGS GROUPS REGULARLY TO THE LIBRARY AND SUCCESSFUL
CLASSES HAVE BEEN HELD THERE FOR THEM TOGETHER WITH NON-HANDICAPPED CHILDREN.
THE LIBRARIAN GIVES GUIDANCE ON BOOKS DURING TRAINING COURSES FOR THE MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED AND GROUPS OF MENTALLY HANDICAPPED WILL BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE BOOKS
IN PEACE OUTSIDE NORMAL LIBRARY HOURS.

PARTICIPANTS' PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE IN PROVIDING MEDIA SERVICES AND
MATERIALS TO HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
YOUTH, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WORK WITH YOUNG ADULTS.
     
IN THE LAST 25 YEARS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS AFFECTING YOUTH, BUT ONE
OF THE LEAST DISCUSSED IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSION, IS HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT.
EXPLORES THIS TOPIC, WITH A VIEW TO DEVELOPING AN APPROACH THAT WILL SERVE AS
A MODEL FOR AN EXTENDED STUDY IN THIS AND OTHER AREAS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING THE
LIVES OF YOUTH. DISCUSSES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE US UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM, THE
EVOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES DEVELOPED TO DEAL WITH IT, AND A DEFINITION
OF THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO IT.
INTRODUCTION TO THE CONFERENCE.
     
A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, ON THE THEME CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO
SERVICES AND MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE GOAL WAS THE
STIMULATION OF CRITICAL EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION, WITH CLARIFICATION OF THE
RIGHTS OF THE CHILD, AND EXAMINATION OF THOSE ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE DENIAL OR
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE RIGHTS.

HEMATIC ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE
GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CONTAINING 7
ARTICLES, FOR ABSTRACTS OF WHICH 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
NOTES ON 'LIBRARY, SCHOOL, READING'.
     
DISCUSSION OF THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN RELATION TO THE SCHOOL IN ITALY. WITH
GROWING ACCEPTANCE THAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD PROMOTE CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AS WELL AS MAKE BOOKS AVAILABLE, THE LACK OF ANY COHERENT ORGANISATIONAL
STRUCTURE AT NATIONAL OR LOCAL LEVEL COORDINATING ACTIVITIES IN THE PUBLIC
DOMAIN BECOMES VERY NOTICEABLE, PARTICULARLY WHERE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ARE
CONCERNED IN PROMOTING READING HABITS. THE SITUATION AT PRESENT IS ONE OF
REPRESSED RIVALRY, WHERE ROLES ARE UNDEFINED. THE DIVERGENT ATTITUDES OF
TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED, WITH REFERENCE TO READING IN THE
CONTEXT OF THE SPREAD OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA.
CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES' PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY MEMORIAL
PUBLIC LIBRARY, MARYLAND, 1980.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES IN THE US, NUMBERLESS REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO DETERMINE
WHAT KINDS OF SERVICE SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR CHILDREN AND WHAT LIMITATIONS
SHOULD BE PLACED ON THOSE SERVICES AND ON THE USE OF MATERIALS IN THE LIBRARY.
AS FACILITIES FOR SHARING INFORMATION HAVE GROWN, SO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT
CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SUCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AS DATA BASES AND TO
INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROGRAMMES. IN 1967, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
REVISED THE 2LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS1 TO ENSURE THAT LIBRARY USE NOT BE DENIED
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY ARE MINORS. LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON HOW THE
INTENTION OF THIS ACTION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR IGNORED. EVALUATES 1
LIBRARY'S APPROACH TO ACCESS FOR CHILDREN, EXAMINING POLICIES, REGULATIONS,
PRACTICES, AND COORDINATIONS THAT AFFECT SUCH ACCESS.
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE PUBLIC' PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH
CONFERENCE OF THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HELD AT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE COLLEGE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA, WAIGANI, PORT MORESBY, 18TH AND
19TH OCTOBER 1979.
     
THE OPENING ADDRESS BY SIMON KENEHE GIVES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PROBLEMS
CONCERNING THE DELIVERY OF INFORMATION IN PRESENT DAY PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THE
MAIN SESSIONS OF THE CONFERENCE LOOKED AT' STRATEGIES IN THE PLANNING OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES; THE STATE OF LIBRARIES FOR THE PUBLIC IN
PAPUA NEW GUINEA; LITERACY AND THE LIBRARY; REACHING OUT' ACCESS TO
LIBRARY-BASED INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE RURAL AREAS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA; AND
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN INFORMATION WORK. CONCLUDES WITH A PAPER BY TONY AUSTIN
ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE LANDSHUT MUNICIPAL LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
THE LANDSHUT LIBRARY SYSTEM COMPRISES 3 PUBLIC LIBRARIES WHICH ARE ALSO SCHOOL
LIBRARIES, 1 HOSPITAL LIBRARY AND 9 SCHOOL LIBRARIES, ALL ADMINISTERED BY A
CENTRAL LIBRARY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PURCHASING AND PROCESSING. THE NEEDS OF
8,000 PUPILS ARE CATERED FOR IN 12 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 1 SPECIAL
SCHOOL, 2 VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND 2 COLLEGES OF FURTHER EDUCATION. 123 CLASSES
VISIT THE LIBRARIES WEEKLY AND SPECIAL HELP IS GIVEN TO FOREIGN CHILDREN. AIMS
FOR THE FUTURE INCLUDE INCREASING STOCKS IN ALL LIBRARIES TO 10 BOOKS PER
PUPIL, PROVIDING MORE SPACE AND STOCK FOR OLDER PUPILS, INCORPORATING
TEACHERS' LIBRARIES INTO THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND MAKING WORK IN THE LIBRARY
AN INTEGRAL PART OF SCHOOL CURRICULA.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP' THE WORK OF THE I.A.S.L.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR SCHOOL
LIBRARIANSHIP AND PRESENTS BRIEF ACCOUNTS OF SOME RECENT CONFERENCES. SINCE
ITS LAUNCH IN 1970, THE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN WORKING FOR IMPROVED STATUS AND
RECOGNITION FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND HAS BEEN SUPPORTING DEVELOPING SCHOOL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS WORLDWIDE.
WORKPLACE LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY' MUTUAL COMPETITION FOR THE BEST LOAN
STATISTICS.
     
AFTER THE 2ND WORLD WAR, WEST GERMANY CONTINUED AS IT LEFT OFF IN 1933, WITH
FACTORY LIBRARIES IN THE OLD PATRIARCHAL FORM AND LIBRARY POLICIES WITH
TRADITIONAL BOURGEOIS IDEALS. IN EAST GERMANY, HOWEVER, A PERIOD OF
DENAZIFICATION AND REBUILDING OF SOCIETY IN A SOCIALIST FORM FOLLOWED THE WAR.
LIBRARIES RECEIVED HIGH PRIORITY IN THE ANTI-FASCIST PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN, WITH
ACCESS TO LIBRARIES IN 96% OF DISTRICTS IN 1957 COMPARED TO 40% IN 1947. A
PURGE OF LIBRARY BOOKS WAS CARRIED OUT ON STALINIST PRINCIPLES WITH SOME
LIBRARIES LOSING UP TO 90% OF THEIR STOCK. HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
EXPANDED RAPIDLY, BUT WITHOUT DEVIATION FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE IN BOOK
SELECTION. A NETWORK OF WORKPLACE LIBRARIES UNDER THE TRADE UNIONS HAS ALSO
BEEN DEVELOPED IN KEEPING WITH THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO LIBRARIES FOR
IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION. THE BASIS FOR THESE LIBRARIES IS THE MAXIM' ALL WORKERS
MUST READ. TH E LIBRARIES MUST REACH A CERTAIN NORM IN LENDING FIGURES AND
CONTROL WITH THE MATERIAL BORROWED IS POSSIBLE. THE WORKPLACE LIBRARIES, FAR
FROM BEING AN EXPRESSION OF WORKING CLASS DEMOCRACY, ARE AN IDEOLOGICAL
INSTRUMENT OF THE TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP DIRECTED AT THE WORKING CLASS.
PERFORMANCE REPORT FOR ETHNICITY AND LIBRARIANSHIP INSTITUTE 2' MULTIETHNIC
LIBRARY MATERIALS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN NEW YORK CITY AND ITS ENVIRONS-LONG
ISLAND, WESTCHESTER, CONNECTICUT, NEW JERSEY.
     
DESCRIBES THE ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF AN INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE
CREDIT AT THE POST-MASTER'S DEGREE LEVEL WHICH FOCUSED ON THE PROVISION OF
BETTER LIBRARY MATERIALS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR ETHNIC
GROUPS. THE INSTITUTE WAS ORGANISED IN 4 PARTS; (1) ETHNIC STUDIES' HERITAGE
AND CONTRIBUTION OF MINORITY GROUPS, THEIR TREATMENT IN LIBRARY MEDIA,
DEMOGRAPHY, HISTORY, POLITICS, AND SOCIOLOGY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY
PROGRAMMES FOR MINORITIES; (3) LIBRARY RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES, SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES; AND (4) ETHNIC RESOURCE FACILITIES,
SPECIFICALLY IN THE METROPOLITAN NEW YORK AREA. A COMPARISON OF ACTUAL
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH STATED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMME. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR FOR THE PERIOD MARCH 1978-DECEMBER 1979.
     
THE 1ST REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR RESEARCH ON USER STUDIES
COVERED THE PERIOD NOV 75-FEB 78 (BLRD REPORT 5446).
GENERAL ASPECTS OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN RESEARCH WORKS DONE
IN HEALTH INSTITUTIONS.
     
IN THE BANSKA BYSTRICA COUNTRY HEALTH INSTITUTE OF SLOVAKIA LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR YEARS. WISHING TO IMPROVE
THEIR SERVICES A SURVEY BY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS MADE TO REVEAL USER DEMAND ON
LITERATURE. FROM THE 250 QUESTIONNAIRES SENT OUT, 60 WERE ANSWERED. BESIDES
USUAL ANSWERS IT DESERVES MENTION THAT 31.7% OF RESPONDENTS VOTED FOR BOOKS,
43.3% FOR PERIODICALS. USUALLY THERE IS A BIGGER SHIFT TOWARD PERIODICALS THAN
IN THIS SURVEY.
STUDENT USE OF THE LIBRARY AT DEPAUW UNIVERSITY.
     
STUDY CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN USE OF THE ACADEMIC
LIBRARY AND THE CLASSROOM PROGRAMME AT DEPAUW UNIVERSITY, A SMALL, 4-YEAR
LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE. RECORDED CIRCULATION FROM THE 3 CAMPUS LIBRARIES FOR THE
SECOND SEMESTER OF 1975-76 WAS STUDIED AND RELATED TO SUCH VARIABLES AS
DECLARED ACADEMIC MAJOR, ACADEMIC CLASS, SEX, HIGH SCHOOL CLASS SIZE, HIGH
SCHOOL CLASS RANK, AND SEMESTER GRADE POINT AVERAGE OF ALL 2,217 ON-CAMPUS
STUDENTS. NO MEANINGFUL RELATION BETWEEN RECORDED LIBRARY CIRCULATION AND
THESE VARIABLES COULD BE FOUND. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF HISTORIANS.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF HISTORIANS IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF HISTORY.
IT INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE FORMATS FROM WHICH THEY GET THEIR INFORMATION,
WHERE THEY FIND RELEVANT REFERENCES, AND HOW THEY USE MATERIALS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGES. THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE FOUND IN OTHER SURVEYS AND WITH
CITATION STUDIES.
THE ADVENTURES OF READING AND THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN.
     
A TRANSLATION FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH OF A PAPER BY THE DIRECTRIX OF THE
FRENCH JOY THROUGH BOOKS PROGRAMME, FOUNDED IN 1963 TO DEVELOP CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF READING IN RELATION TO THE
PROLIFERATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF BOTH THE
RECREATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL ADVANTAGES OFFERED. IN THE LIBRARY, THE CHILD
IS FREE TO CHOOSE HIS OWN READING MATERIAL, AND IT IS HERE THAT THE MEDIATION
OF AN ADULT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE YOUNG INITIATE IS ENCOURAGED IN HIS
ENTHUSIASMS, IN LEARNING HOW TO USE AND ENJOY BOOKS, AND IN APPRECIATING THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN READING AND LIFE. WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF THE
LIBRARIAN, THE LIBRARY CAN ONLY BE A DISTRIBUTION CENTRE.
EDUCATIONAL MEDIA AND LEARNING THEORIES.
     
EDUCATIONAL MEDIA WILL NOT REPLACE THE TEACHER, BUT THEY DO MAKE TEACHING
EASIER AND RESULT IN GREATER LEARNING. PRESENTS THE VARIOUS OPINIONS
CONCERNING THEIR USE, NOTING THAT THERE IS NOT SO MUCH DISAGREEMENT OR
CONTRADICTION AS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS. REFERS TO RESEARCH STUDIES
THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THROUGH CAREFUL SELECTION AND USE OF EDUCATIONAL
MEDIA MANY OBSTACLES FOR EFFECTIVE LEARNING CAN BE OVERCOME.
LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION' THE RUSSIAN EXPERIENCE.
     
DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT EDUCATION IN RUSSIA, A PROCESS WHICH
OCCURRED IN THE 2ND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON HOW
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE UTILISED AS INSTRUMENTS OF ADULT EDUCATION, BOTH BEFORE
THE REVOLUTION, AND ESPECIALLY DURING THE 1ST DECADE OF SOVIET RULE.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING: PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP WEEK-END SCHOOL AT BATH IN APRIL 1980.
     
COMPRISES 2 PAPERS: PARTNERSHIPS, BY JANE ANDERSON WHICH ARGUES FOR CLOSER,
DELIBERATE COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS LINKED TO
EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING; AND SITUATION DESPERATE-ATTACK! BY JAMES BOYLE,
WHICH ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES MUST FIND A WAY OF DEVELOPING NATIONAL POLICIES
AND STRATEGIES VIS-A-VIS EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING, THEY MUST PRESENT
THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS IN ADULT EDUCATION RATHER THAN AS
SERVICING AGENTS, AND THEY MUST BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE AS SERVICE RETAILERS,
PROFESSIONALS, AND POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS WITH OTHER AGENCIES.
THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL AND IDEO-POLITICAL AWARENESS.
     
ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES (SCHOOL, PUBLIC AND TRADE UNION) HAVE TO IMPART THE
IDEAS OF THE 12TH COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS TO THE ENTIRE BULGARIAN NATION. THE
COMMUNIST CONGRESS OUTLINED ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL POLICIES WHICH HAVE
TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY WORKERS IN INDUSTRY AND IN AGRICULTURE ACTING IN A
DISCIPLINED AND RESPONSIBLE WAY. LIBRARIANS MUST USE A SYSTEMATIC AND PERSONAL
APPROACH AND DEAL WITH THE CLASS STRUGGLE, THE ROLE OF THE USSR IN THE WORLD,
THE GENERAL INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AND MANY OTHER TOPICS ON ALL THE REQUIRED
LEVELS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD DISPLAY RELEVANT LITERATURE, ARRANGE EXHIBITIONS AND
DISCUSSION MEETINGS, AND COMPILE RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THESE ARE ONLY A
FEW SUGGESTIONS WHICH MUST BE IMPLEMENTED TO REACH THE SET GOALS.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.
     
FOR AN ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE 2SEE 1THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBER'-.
THE BRILLOUIN INFORMATION MEASURE APPLIED TO MATERIALS SELECTION.
     
DESCRIBES THE USE OF THE BRILLOUIN FORMULA TO ASSESS THE MEASURE OF IMPACT OF
AN ADDED DOCUMENT ON THE DIVERSITY OR RELATEDNESS OF A SUBJECT COLLECTION. THE
BRILLOUIN FORMULA IS AN INFORMATION MEASURE WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO MEASURE THE
ORDER OR DISORDER OF A PARTICULAR POPULATION DISTRIBUTED OVER A NUMBER OF
UNIQUE CLASSES. CONCLUDES THAT THIS FORMULA CAN MEASURE THE IMPACT OF AN ADDED
DOCUMENT ON THE DIVERSITY OR RELATEDNESS OF A SUBJECT COLLECTION WHEN THE
COMPUTATION IS MADE USING ONE-WAY COMMUNICATION.
A QUANTITATIVE INVENTORY OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION FOR
METROPOLITAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.
     
DESCRIBES MATERIALS USED BY SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN PREPARING INDEPENDENT
STUDY PAPERS AND OTHER TYPES OF ASSIGNMENTS CALLING FOR LIBRARY USE, INCLUDING
THE USE OF HOME COLLECTIONS AND SCHOOL, PUBLIC, COLLEGE, AND SPECIAL
LIBRARIES. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS WERE USED TO PROVIDE MEASUREMENT OF THE NATURE
AND CURRENCY OF BOOKS, MAGAZINES, ENCYCLOPEDIAS, NEWSPAPERS, GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENTS, AND PAMPHLETS REFERENCED BY STUDENTS. A SAMPLE OF 15 HIGH SCHOOLS
REPRESENTING 5 SCHOOLS DISTRICTS AND 2 INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS PROVIDED DATA ON
1,845 STUDENTS FROM 73 CLASSES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
COHERENT INFORMATIONAL ENERGY AND ENTROPY.
     
AIMING TO PROVIDE A COMMON THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR ALL KNOWN BIBLIOMETRIC
LAWS, STARTS FROM A SYSTEMIC VIEW OF THE INFORMATION TRANSFER PROCESS AND
LIKENS IT TO A PHYSICAL DIFFUSION PROCESS, IN PARTICULAR THE CONDUCTION OF
HEAT IN SOLIDS. THE INTEREST POTENTIAL OF NEW AUTHORS IS EQUIVALENT TO
TEMPERATURE. THE MODEL ALSO ALLOWS FOR NEW DEFINITIONS OF INFORMATIONAL ENERGY
AND ENTROPY, CORRESPONDING TO THE PHYSICAL DEFINITIONS. DISCUSSES THE
POSSIBILITY OF INTRODUCING INFORMATION INTO CONCRETE THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEMS
ANALYSIS.
ELECTRON LATTICE SCATTERING TECHNIQUE FOR CITATION ANALYSIS AND EVALUATING THE
IMPACT OF RESEARCH PAPERS.
     
INTRODUCES A PHYSICAL MODEL FOR MEASURING THE IMPACT OF RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION
BASED ON SCATTERING OF ELECTRONS BY THE LATTICE ATOMS. DESCRIBES SCATTERING AS
A STOCHASTIC PROCESS AND ADOPTS AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION IN WHICH LATTICE ATOMS
AND ELECTRONS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY A SYSTEM OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND POTENTIAL
CITERS RESPECTIVELY. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ABOVE MODEL, THE AUTHORS HAVE
MADE A NUMBER OF SIMPLIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND DEVELOPED AN ABSORPTION
INDEX ACTIVITY TO BE USED AS AN INDEX FOR MEASURING RELATIVE IMPACT OF VARIOUS
CONTRIBUTIONS IN A GIVEN FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
VIETNAMESE COLLECTIONS IN THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE: THEIR UNIQUENESS,
ORGANIZATION, AND ACCESSIBILITY.
     
EDITED, TRANSLATED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED IN FRENCH AT THE 46TH IFLA
GENERAL CONFERENCE, MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1980. THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE IN
PARIS HAS 80% OF THE TOTAL VOLUME OF MATERIAL ON THE INDOCHINESE PENINSULA.
OUTLINES THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO ITS VIETNAMESE COLLECTION AND ITS
ORGANISATION, CATALOGUING, AND CLASSIFICATION. BRIEFLY DISCUSSES PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED WITH ARRANGING SUCH A COLLECTION (E.G. SHOULD IT BE DIVIDED
ACCORDING TO LANGUAGE OR CULTURE?).
ANCIENT BULGARIAN MANUSCRIPTS.
     
IN THE COURSE OF BULGARIA'S TURBULENT HISTORY, MUCH OF HER NATIONAL LITERARY
HERITAGE WAS DESTROYED. THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS ITEMS WHICH ENRICH THE
COLLECTIONS OF LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS ABROAD. IN SPITE OF THAT THE COLLECTIONS
OF ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS IN BULGARIA TODAY ARE STILL AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF
RESEARCH. SCHOLARS WHEN STUDYING THE LAVISH ILLUMINATIONS, FIND NOT ONLY NEW
INFORMATION ON THE NATIONAL LITERARY AND CULTURAL HISTORY, BUT ALSO ON THE
ARTS. NOWADAYS, THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA PROUDLY
POSSESSES THE LARGER COLLECTIONS OF ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS REACHING 1400 ITEMS.
THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES' CENTRAL LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY AT THE RILSKIJ MONASTERY
NATIONAL MUSEUM, THE IVAN VAZOV NATIONAL LIBRARY IN PLOVDIV, THE REGIONAL
HISTORIC MUSEUM AT VELIKO TURNOVO, AS WELL AS SOME OTHERS ALSO HAVE
COLLECTIONS. LIBRARIANS AND MUSEUMS' STAFF MUST DO THEIR BEST TO PROVIDE
PROPER CATALOGUING, AS FOR INSTANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA, IN ORDER TO
MAKE THE ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS AVAILABLE BOTH TO RESEARCH WORKERS AND THE
GENERAL PUBLIC.
THE TURKISH COLLECTION IN THE FRENCH BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE DEPARTMENT OF
MANUSCRIPTS.
     
THE 1ST OF A PROJECTED SERIES OF ARTICLES ON TURKISH MATERIAL IN THE
BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF KEMEL ATATURK. THE HISTORY OF
THE COLLECTION IS OUTLINED, FROM ITS BEGINNINGS IN THE 17TH CENTURY, WITH
DETAILS OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COLLECTIONS ADDED, ACQUISITIONS AND GIFTS. THE
COMPOSITION OF THE COLLECTION IS DESCRIBED FULLY, WITH NOTES ON THE HISTORICAL
BACKGROUND AND EXAMPLES OF CHARACTERISTIC ITEMS FROM THE PRE-ISLAMIC, ISLAMIC,
AND OTTOMAN PERIODS. ILLUMINATED AND MODERN MANUSCRIPTS ARE DISCUSSED
SEPARATELY, AND CATALOGUE PROVISION INDICATED BRIEFLY.
HOSPITAL ARCHIVES' THE EXAMPLE OF NOTRE-DAME HOSPITAL, QUEBEC.
     
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE ARCHIVE HOLDINGS OF THE
NOTRE-DAME HOSPITAL, QUEBEC AND HOW THE PROBLEMS OF DEALING WITH LARGE STORES
OF DOCUMENTS DISPERSED OVER NUMEROUS DEPARTMENTS WERE SOLVED. THE INITIAL
TOPOGRAPHICAL INVENTORY BASED ON THE DECENTRALISED SITUATION IS ILLUSTRATED,
AND FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, CATALOGUING AND
INDEXING PROCEDURES EVOLVED TO MEET USER AND DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS. IN
CONCLUSION RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED RELATING TO CENTRALISATION OF ALL
DOCUMENTS AND CONSERVATION WORK, SHOWING THE ADVANTAGES TO BE GAINED FROM A
MORE THOROUGH-GOING ARCHIVAL OVERHAUL.
ARCHIVAL RESOURCES AND HISTORY' SOME IDEAS ON A SYSTEMS-PROSPECTUS APPROACH.
     
DISCUSSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HISTORICAL RESEARCH AND ARCHIVAL
OPERATIONS, WHERE THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE 2 CONSTITUTES A SYSTEM RESULTING
IN THE PRODUCTION OF HISTORY. TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF THE
ARCHIVE FROM THE 19TH CENTURY ONWARDS, WITH REFERENCE TO THE EVOLUTION OF A
CONCEPT OF HISTORY BASED NOT ON THEMATIC OR QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES, BUT
SEEKING TO GENERATE NEW OBJECTS OF STUDY. THE CRUCIAL NECESSITY FOR FULL
COOPERATION BETWEEN ARCHIVISTS AND RESEARCHERS IS ILLUSTRATED, AND SHOWN TO BE
ESSENTIAL FOR A PROSPECTUS READING OF THE PRESENT AND THE PAST, UNENCUMBERED
BY TRANSITORY CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDES.
ARCHIVES AND DISPLAYING THE HERITAGE.
     
A PAPER DELIVERED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE QUEBEC ARCHIVISTS
ASSOCIATION, WHICH DRAWS ON COMMUNICATION THEORY TO PRESENT A DYNAMIC
INTERPRETATION OF THE ARCHIVIST'S ROLE IN MAKING THE PUBLIC AWARE OF THE
VALUES OF THE PAST. THE ELEMENTS CONSTITUTING THE PAST ARE DEFINED, AND THE
ATTITUDES OF THE HISTORIAN AND THE INTERPRETER COMPARED AND CONTRASTED; THE
COMMUNICATION PROCESS IS THEN EXPLAINED AND ILLUSTRATED; AND A DEFINITION OF
INTERPRETATION DERIVED AND RELATED TO THE EXHIBITION OF ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. THE
ROLE OF THE ARCHIVIST AS TRANSMITTER OF THE MESSAGES OF THE PAST TO THE PUBLIC
IS THEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, CLARIFYING THE OBJECTIVES WHICH SHOULD BE HIS
PRIORITIES.
EVALUATION OF REFERENCE COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND HIGH
SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
BRIEFLY REVIEWS THE LITERATURE RELATING TO THE EVALUATION OF REFERENCE
COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC, COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
COMPARES THE VIEWS OF A SAMPLE OF US LIBRARIANS IN THESE 3 TYPES OF LIBRARIES
ON THIS EVALUATION. CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A GAP NOT ONLY BETWEEN WHAT HAS
BEEN REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE CONCERNING EVALUATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS
AND THE ACTUAL WORLD OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS, BUT ALSO BETWEEN WHAT
LIBRARIANS FEEL IS IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE ABOUT EVALUATION, AND WHAT THEY ARE
ACTUALLY DOING IN THEIR LIBRARIES.
SEARCHING FOR CONFERENCE LITERATURE (IN CHINESE).
     
DESCRIBES THE AUTHORS' EXPERIENCES CONCERNING THE HANDLING OF CONFERENCE
PROCEEDINGS AND DISCUSSES THE DEFINITION, CHARACTERISTICS, ACQUISITION, AND
REFERENCE TOOLS OF PROCEEDINGS.
TOYS AND GAMES IN LIBRARIES.
     
PRESENTS THE VIEWS OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGISTS WHICH JUSTIFY THE CASE FOR TOY
LIBRARIES. GIVES THE HISTORY OF TOY LIBRARIES IN THE UK, CONSIDERS
ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS AND DISCUSSES POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. ALSO GIVES EXAMPLES
OF TOY LIBRARIES ABROAD, AND SUGGESTS PLANS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TOY
LIBRARY SERVICE WITHIN THE UK PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE (SEE ALSO 81/5282-5283).
AN UNEASY RELATIONSHIP? AUDIO-VISUAL RESOURCES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE RELUCTANCE TO PROMOTE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL RESOURCES. TRACES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, SHOWING HOW LIBRARIANS
HAVE COME TO CONSIDER BOOKS AS THE CHIEF RESOURCE. USERS, HOWEVER, PRIMARILY
NEED INFORMATION, AND HERE AUDIO-VISUAL RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EFFICIENT
SERVICES. THE KINDS OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE ARE SURVEYED BRIEFLY IN CONCLUSION,
WITH SOME INDICATION OF COSTS AND PLANNING PROCEDURES.
A COMPARISON OF MEDIA SERVICES OF WASHINGTON COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OREGON
STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.
     
THE EDUCATIONAL MEDIA PROGRAMMES, STAFFING, AND BUDGETS OF 27 COMMUNITY
COLLEGES IN WASHINGTON AND 7 STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN OREGON ARE
COMPARED IN THIS STUDY. THE RESULTS INDICATE CLOSE SIMILARITY IN THE TYPES OF
SERVICES OFFERED. MOST WASHINGTON COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE INTEGRATED
LIBRARY-MEDIA PROGRAMMES. LESS THAN HALF OF THE STATE COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES IN OREGON HAVE INTEGRATED LIBRARY-MEDIA PROGRAMMES. MEDIA STAFF
SIZE APPEARS TO BE LARGER IN OREGON WITH RESPECT TO THE RATIO OF STAFF TO
STUDENTS BUT SMALLER IN TERMS OF THE RATIO OF STAFF TO FACULTY. ALTHOUGH THE
OVERALL MEDIA DOLLARS SPENT PER STUDENT ARE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 2
STATES, THE WASHINGTON COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE A MORE GENEROUS BUDGET FOR
OPERATIONS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS.
THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED READERS MUST BE GIVEN HIGH PRIORITY.
     
DESCRIBES THE WORK OF ARHUS PUBLIC LIBRARIES' AV DEPARTMENT, OPENED IN DEC 80.
THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDES RECORD PLAYERS, TAPE RECORDERS, SCREENS FOR SLIDES AND
TRANSCRIPT READERS FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TEXT. THE STOCK INCLUDES BOOKS WITH
TAPES, TALKING BOOKS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, ART SLIDES, NON-MUSICAL RECORDS
AND CASSETTES, EASY READERS, PICTORIAL WORKS AND MAGNAPRINT BOOKS. THE USERS
ARE THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED, MOSTLY THE ELDERLY, AND THOSE WITH
READING DIFFICULTIES, MOSTLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. NOT ALL MATERIALS,
E.G. THE LANGUAGE COURSES AND ART SLIDES, ARE AIMED AT THE HANDICAPPED.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE HANDICAPPED PLACES GREATER DEMANDS ON THE STAFF THAN
OTHER LENDING SERVICES. FEW USERS ARE ABLE TO HELP THEMSELVES TO MATERIAL AND
NEED ASSISTANCE FROM THE STAFF; MOST MATERIAL NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED AND PLAYED
BEFORE BORROWING AND CHECKING ON RETURN. THE DEPARTMENT BUYS PUBLISHED
EDITIONS OF BOOKS CUM TAPES, AND ALSO RECORDS SUITABLE BOOKS ITSELF, BUT
DEMAND FOR MATERIAL IS FAR FROM BEING SATISFIED.
THE BIRTH OF A NATION, MICROFICHE, AND FILM SCHOLARSHIP.
     
DESCRIBES THE USE OF MICROFICHE FOR THE STORING OF INDIVIDUAL MOTION PICTURE
FRAMES-A SORT OF 'VISUAL SCORE' OF THE FILM-AND THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON BIRTH OF
A NATION: A FORMAL SHOT-BY-SHOT ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH MICROFICHE, THE 1ST
OFFERING IN RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS, INC.'S CINEMA EDITIONS ON MICROFICHE
(CINE/FICHE). OUTLINES HOW SUCH PUBLICATIONS WILL AID THE STUDY OF FILMS AND
DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF THE PUBLICATION'S HARD COPY TEXT COMPONENT.
POSTCARDS ARE POPULAR, BUT NOT IN YOUR LIBRARY.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF US AND CANADIAN PUBLIC, ACADEMIC, SPECIAL
AND ART MUSEUM LIBRARIES REGARDING COLLECTIONS OF POSTCARDS-HOW THEY WERE
ORGANISED, HOW UPDATED AND WHO, IF ANYONE, USED THEM. MAKES PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO ART REPRODUCTIONS, MAIL ART AND ARTIST'S POSTCARDS. A LIST OF
LIBRARIES RESPONDING TO THE SURVEY IS APPENDED.
G&M: WHENCE, WHY, WHITHER?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A MEETING OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND MAP DIVISION DURING THE
SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE, WASHINGTON, DC, JUNE 80. TRACES THE
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIVISION, EXPLAINING HOW GEOGRAPHY AND MAP
LIBRARIANS BECAME AFFILIATED WITH THE SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION RATHER
THAN BEING DRAWN INTO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ORBIT. MENTIONS THE
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE CAUSED RAPID AND IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR MAP
COLLECTIONS AND STATES THAT THE DIVISION STANDS AT THE CROSSROADS. CAN
CONSENSUS FOR ITS FUTURE COURSE BE ACHIEVED?.
INTRODUCTION TO THE GEOGRAPHY AND MAP LIBRARIES SECTION OF IFLA.
     
HISTORY AND STATE OF THE ART OF THE SECTION, FORMED IN 1969 TO ESTABLISH MAP
LIBRARIANSHIP ON A PROFESSIONAL FOOTING. ALSO DESCRIBED ARE THE SECTION'S
WORKING GROUPS, WHOSE WORK INCLUDES PUBLICATIONS AND STANDARDS.
MICROFILM CONVERSION IN AN ACADEMIC PHYSICS LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES THE CONVERSION OF MODERATELY-USED PHYSICS JOURNALS FROM HARD COPY TO
ROLL MICROFILM AT THE PHYSICS LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA AT MINNEAPOLIS.
DESPITE INITIAL AND PRE-CONVERSION USER RESISTANCE, CONCLUSIONS BASED ON
MONITORING THE USE OF THE FILMED TITLES SUGGESTS THAT MOST
NON-INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNALS MORE THAN 10 YEARS OLD CAN BE CONVERTED AS LONG
AS GOOD QUALITY POSITIVE PRINTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE RESEARCHER.
MULTUM IN PARVO': APPLICATIONS OF MICROFILM IN CATHEDRAL LIBRARIES.P
     
APER DELIVERED AT THE CATHEDRAL LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE, LONDON, 10 NOV 80.
DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES ADHERENT IN MICROFILMING ARCHIVAL COLLECTIONS. NOTES
ITS PARTICULAR APPLICATION TO PRESERVATION AND SECURITY NEEDS AND TO THE
DISSEMINATION TO SCHOLARS AND INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE OF COPIES OF RARE AND
DIFFICULT-TO-ACCESS MATERIALS FOR USE IN RESEARCH.
SETTING UP THE MICROFICHE LIBRARY.
     
A SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR SETTING UP A MICROFICHE LIBRARY/INFORMATION CENTRE IS
DISCUSSED. OUTLINES AN OPTIMUM SYSTEM FOR INTRODUCING MICROFICHES IN A
LIBRARY/INFORMATION CENTRE BESIDES CONVENTIONAL COPIES TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS
FROM THE USER'S POINT OF VIEW. SUGGESTS POINTS TO BE OBSERVED FOR SELECTION OF
GOOD MICROFICHE READERS.
OPTICAL CONVERSION OF MICROFICHES USING PENTAKTA EQUIPMENT.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS FACED BY A LARGE INFORMATION SYSTEM IN THE
MAGNIFICATION OF MICROFICHE AND INDICATES THE TECHNOLOGICAL, ORGANISATIONAL,
AND ECONOMIC FACTORS WHICH DETERMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF OPTICAL CONVERSION.
REVIEWS CONVERSION EQUIPMENT AND DISCUSSES THE USE OF PENTAKTA UNITS. PRESENTS
THE RESULTS OF TESTS OF 2 DESIGN ALTERNATIVES USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF READER
PROJECTOR/CAMERA ARRANGEMENTS.
VIDEOCASSETTE SERVICES IN QUEBEC PUBLIC LIBRARIES' THE PRESENT SITUATION.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF A SMALL SURVEY BY INTERVIEW IN 1981 OF VIDEOCASSETTE
SERVICES IN QUEBEC PUBLIC LIBRARIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE EQUIPMENT
AVAILABLE, NUMBER OF LIBRARIES INVOLVED, THE SYSTEMS USED, AND CHOICE OF
TITLES. A COMPARISON IS MADE WITH THE U.S.A., AND IN CONCLUSION EXPANSION OF
THIS SERVICE AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF LIBRARY PROVISION URGED.
VIDEO IN THREE AMERICAN LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE OF 3 US PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH VIDEO. THE ACTIVITIES
CENTRED AROUND DEVELOPMENT OF A VIDEO COLLECTION AND PRODUCTION OF PROGRAMMES
WITH THE LIBRARY'S OWN EQUIPMENT. DONNELL'S PUBLIC LIBRARY, NEW YORK, WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST TO BUILD UP A VIDEO COLLECTION; ITS FILM STUDY CENTER, BEGUN IN
1958, EXPANDED IN 1975 WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VIDEO CENTER. THE CENTER
HAS 700 TITLES AND ACCESS TO 200 NON-COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED PROGRAMMES. BOULDER
PUBLIC LIBRARY, COLORADO, HAS A MEDIA DEPARTMENT WITH 250 VIDEOGRAMS OF A WIDE
VARIETY AND ITS OWN VIDEO PRODUCTION. IN 1978 IT BEGAN TO SET UP A VIDEO
REFERENCE CENTRE FOR COLORADO. FORT WASHINGTON PUBLIC LIBRARY, NEAR NEW YORK,
HAS HAD A MEDIA WORKSHOP, MEDIA PORT, SINCE 1973, CONSISTING OF A PHOTO, VIDEO
AND FILM WORKSHOP, ART DEPARTMENT, AND MEDIA REFERENCE CENTRE. THE AIM OF THE
WORKSHOP IS TO GIVE THE LOCAL POPULATION A CHANCE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES
THROUGH THESE MEDIA. TRANSMISSION OF LOCALL Y PRODUCED PROGRAMMES BY THE
LIBRARY ON THE LOCAL TV IS PLANNED. THE IMPORTANCE OF VIDEO IN LIBRARIES TO
ENSURE DISTRIBUTION OF NON-COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS WAS EVERYWHERE ACKNOWLEDGED.
HEBREW MANUSCRIPTS IN NEW YORK LIBRARIES (IN HEBREW).
     
SURVEYS COLLECTIONS OF HEBREW MANUSCRIPTS IN 13 INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES AND
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. THE MORE IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING
MANUSCRIPTS ARE DESCRIBED IN BRIEF. A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE HEBREW
MANUSCRIPTS IN 5 INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES AND 1 PRIVATE COLLECTION IN
WASHINGTON D.C. AND PHILADELPHIA IS ALSO INCLUDED.
SUBJECT RELATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES' CONSENSUS AND PARADIGM.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH). ARGUES THAT USE OF A LARGE
MULTIDISCIPLINARY MONOGRAPH COLLECTION PROVIDES DATA FOR THE STUDY OF A
SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE, SPECIFICALLY THE SUBJECT RELATIONS AMONG VARIOUS
DISCIPLINES, AND THAT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF DISCIPLINES CAN BE INFERRED
FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THEIR LITERATURE AND ITS USE. TO THIS END, 5 SOCIAL
SCIENCE DISCIPLINES ARE STUDIED-GEOGRAPHY, ANTHROPOLOGY, ECONOMICS, SOCIOLOGY,
AND POLITICAL SCIENCE.
NON-LEGAL REFERENCE BOOKS FOR LAW LIBRARIES.
     
UPDATE TO, AND EXPANSION OF, A BIBLIOGRAPHY PRODUCED BY J. MYRON JACOBSTEIN,
AND PUBLISHED IN LAW LIBR. J. (FEB 60). THE BIBLIOGRAPHY IS DIVIDED INTO 2
SECTIONS: THE 1ST INCLUDES 'PERMANENT' TITLES-THOSE UPDATED IRREGULARLY AND
INFREQUENTLY AND WHICH THEREFORE DO NOT INVOLVE ONGOING EXPENSE; THE 2ND
INCLUDES PERIODICALS, SERVICES, ANNUALS AND BIENNIAL WORKS; MANY OF THE LATTER
GROUP HAVE PERMANENT VALUE AND INVOLVE AN ONGOING AND PREDICTABLE COMMITMENT
OF LIBRARY FUNDS. ALL LISTED TITLES ARE CURRENTLY IN PRINT AND READILY

EMILIA-ROMAGNA' PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR LIBRARIES.
     
A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT SITUATION IN A NORTH ITALIAN PROVINCE, WHERE
SERVICES ARE UNCOORDINATED AND UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED. DRAWING ON AN INDEPENDENT
SURVEY PUBLISHED IN 1979, GIVES DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN
OPERATION, AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS' UNIVERSITY, CHURCH, SCHOOL, LOCAL AND
PRIVATE. THE INEQUALITY OF SERVICE PROVISION IS DEMONSTRATED, AND THE NEED FOR
A REGIONAL POLICY INVOLVING CREATION OF NEW LIBRARIES AND RATIONALISATION OF
EXISTING RESOURCES SHOWN. THE OPERATION OF URBAN LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN BOLOGNA
AND MODENA IS DESCRIBED, AND THE PROJECTED NETWORK SERVICE, BASED ON
DESIGNATED LIBRARY CONSORTIA, SUCH AS BOLOGNA-FERRARA, IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY
THE RELUCTANCE OF THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL LEGISLATION
FOR REORGANISING AND RESTRUCTURING LIBRARY SERVICES IS CONDEMNED AS THE ROOT
FACTOR INHIBITING NETWORK DEVELOPMENT.
VENETO' TOWARDS A POLICY LINE FOR LIBRARIES.
     
AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEMS BESETTING THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF
LIBRARY SERVICES IN A NORTH ITALIAN REGION, IN RELATION TO INDEPENDENT
PROPOSALS FOR A TOTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE SYSTEM. THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL
ROLES OF EACH COMPONENT ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL' THE STATE AND ITS
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY NETWORK; THE REGION AND THE NEED FOR
LEGAL INTERVENTION TO CREATE A BASIS FOR AN EFFECTIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM; CELBIV,
THE REGIONAL PUBLISHERS' COOPERATIVE SERVING PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
THE NEED TO CAPITALISE ON THE RESOURCES IT OFFERS; THE PROVINCE AND THE
ORGANISATION OF COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES; AND THE TOWN, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO PROJECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN VENICE. AN APPENDIX CONTAINS THE RECENT
PROPOSALS FROM CELBIV TO ESTABLISH A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICE TO PUBLIC AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES, COVERING CHILDREN'S BOOKS ONLY, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE
CATALOGUING SERVICES AND AN INFORMATION CENTRE.
THE CANADIAN PUBLIC ARCHIVES AND THE REPORT ENTITLED THE FUTURE OF THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CANADA.
     
A SLIGHTLY CONDENSED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONGRESS
OF THE QUEBEC ARCHIVISTS' ASSOCIATION, BY A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
ESTABLISHED BY THE CANADIAN PUBLIC ARCHIVES TO REPLY TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
REPORT OF 1979. DEALS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE FOR TRANSFERRING MAPS,
MANUSCRIPTS AND MUSIC FROM THE PUBLIC ARCHIVES TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY,
INSISTING ON THE RETENTION OF THE DIVISION OF MATERIAL BETWEEN THE 2
INSTITUTIONS ACCORDING TO PHYSICAL FORM, NOT SUBJECT MATTER. SHOWS HOW THE
PRESENT ARRANGEMENT CAME INTO BEING BY INTENTION, NOT ACCIDENT; THE
UNNECESSARY EXPENSE INVOLVED IN CREATING AN ARCHIVE SECTION AT THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY; AND THE IRRELEVANCE OF FOREIGN MODELS TO THE CANADIAN SITUATION.
REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE LEGISLATION CURRENTLY IN FORCE, AND THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY RECOMMENDATIONS FINALLY DISMISSED AS IMPRACTICAL AND ILL-CONCEIVED.
RESOURCE NOTEBOOK ON PLANNING.
     
FOCUSES ON LIBRARY PLANNING. AN INTRODUCTION PROVIDES BACKGROUND AND A
CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW OF LIBRARY PLANNING PROCESSES. THE FIRST SECTION OF
DOCUMENTS PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF DATA GATHERING TOOLS AND APPROACHES TO
GATHERING INFORMATION, THE SECOND GROUP OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATES METHODS OF
DESCRIBING AND ANALYSING PLANNING NEEDS, AND THE FINAL SECTION CONTAINS
EXAMPLES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW APPROACHES TO PLANNING WHICH HAVE BEEN
MADE BY LIBRARIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PROGRESS IN EDP NETWORK SYSTEMS' LIBRARY NETWORKS AND ODIN PROGRAMME.
     
AFTER A DISCUSSION OF THE PLANS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS
ACCORDING TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION AND OTHER
LIBRARY, INFORMATION AND BOOK TRADE NETWORKS ACCORDING TO THE ODIN PROGRAMME
SPONSORED BY THE FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, THE PROGRESS
MADE BY THE REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORKS, BY THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE, BY
THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC AGENCY, AND BY THE BOOK TRADE IS REPORTED.
THE CURRENT STAGE OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY COOPERATION.
     
STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION IN THE USSR CAN BE
TRACED OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. COOPERATION IS OF 3 TYPES' WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK
OF A DEPARTMENT; INVOLVING LIBRARIES FROM SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS BUT ON THE SAME
SITE OR IN THE SAME ECONOMIC FIELD; OR WITHOUT ANY SUCH BOUNDARIES. THE KEY
ELEMENT IS INTEGRATION' THE PLANNED COMBINATION OF RESOURCES FROM DIFFERENT
LIBRARIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE
FORMATION OF A REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORK. IN THE LONG-TERM, SUCH INTEGRATED
SYSTEMS WILL HAVE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SOVIET
LIBRARIANSHIP.
PROGRESS IN THE THEORY OF LIBRARY COORDINATION AND COOPERATION IN SCANDINAVIAN
COUNTRIES.
     
THE BEGINNING OF COOPERATION AND COORDINATION IN SCANDINAVIA IN THE SPHERE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND INFORMATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE THEORETICAL
STUDIES OF THE 1950S. IT WAS THEN THAT THE SCANDIA-PLAN, AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL
PLAN OF COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS OF FOREIGN LITERATURE, WAS STARTED. RESEARCH
INTO COOPERATION HAS DEVELOPED ALONG 3 MAIN LEVELS-NATIONAL, SCANDINAVIAN AND
INTERNATIONAL-AND THIS APPROACH IS REFLECTED IN THE RESEARCH METHODS EMPLOYED.
MATHEMATICAL METHODS ARE USED IN SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES AND STATISTICAL
MATHEMATICS ARE THE NORM ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE SCANDINAVIAN SUCCESS
IN LIBRARY COOPERATION DESERVES GREATER ATTENTION ON THE PART OF SOVIET
LIBRARIANS.
INVESTIGATION OF A COMPUTERIZED NETWORK TO FACILITATE RESOURCE SHARING WITHIN
THE VA LIBRARY NETWORK (VALNET). VOLUME 1.
     
THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS THE INVESTIGATION OF A COMPUTERISED NETWORK TO
FACILITATE RESOURCE SHARING WITHIN THE VA LIBRARY NETWORK. THE PROJECT
CONSISTS OF 3 PHASES' (1) INFORMATION GATHERING, ANALYSIS, AND SYNTHESIS; (2)
PROBLEM DEFINITION; AND (3) REQUIREMENTS FORMULATION.
APPLYING GAME THEORY TO LIBRARY NETWORKS.
     
THE APPLICATION OF GAME THEORY TO LIBRARY NETWORKS CONSISTS OF 4 BASIC
SUBJECTS' THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO STUDY INDIVIDUAL COALITIONS,
THE CALCULATION OF THE COSTS OF A NETWORK, THE CALCULATION OF THE GROSS
BENEFITS FOR THE WHOLE NETWORK, THE STABILITY OF THE NETWORK. CONCENTRATES ON
THE 1ST AND LAST OF THESE SUBJECTS. COALITIONS ARE COMPARED IN A SYSTEMATIC
WAY BY 1ST DEFINING COALITIONS AND INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF A DIVISION. THE
LATTER IS DEFINED AS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF COALITIONS SUCH THAT EVERY
PARTICIPATING LIBRARY IS A MEMBER OF 1 AND ONLY 1 COALITION AND THE DIVISION
EXHAUSTS ALL 'N' LIBRARIES.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A SOCIAL MILIEU.
     
IN DENMARK THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS THE CENTRE OF COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE,
SINCE THERE IS MORE EMPHASIS HERE THAN IN GERMANY ON THEATRICAL AND MUSICAL
ACTIVITIES. LIBRARIES ARE BUILT MAINLY FROM WOOD, SLATE AND GLASS, WITH A
STRUCTURE DESIGNED TO SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES; THEY ARE ALWAYS
SITUATED CENTRALLY WITHIN THEIR AREA. PUPPET THEATRES, TOYS, FACILITIES FOR
PAINTING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC AND EVEN LITTLE PUSH-CHAIRS FOR THE SMALLEST
CHILDREN ARE PROVIDED IN LIBRARIES WITH A LARGE PROPORTION OF CHILD READERS.
ALL LIBRARIES CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE ROOM FOR MEETINGS. BASIC STOCKS ALWAYS
CONTAIN GERMAN AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND TALKING BOOKS FOR THE OLD AND
PARTIALLY SIGHTED. BOOKS ARE TAKEN OUT TO THE HOUSEBOUND AND HANDICAPPED;
LIBRARIES EVEN SUPPLY CHILDREN'S BOOKS FOR USE IN PAEDIATRICIANS'
WAITING-ROOMS.
THE PLACE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM (THE
REALISATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF THE UNIFIED NATIONAL LIBRARY-INFORMATION
SYSTEM).
     
DISCUSSES THE PROGRAMME OF THE YUGOSLAV NATIONAL LIBRARY-INFORMATION SYSTEM
WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIS OBJECTIVES. THE PROGRAMME IS
DIVIDED INTO 6 MAIN PARTS' ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT STATE OF LIBRARIES OF ALL
TYPES ON THE BASIS OF UNIFICATION CRITERIA; DEVELOPMENT OF A DATA BASE
UTILISING THE RESOURCES OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES OF INDIVIDUAL REPUBLICS;
PROCESSING LIBRARY MATERIALS ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WITH A VIEW
TO THE COMPILATION OF UNION CATALOGUES; PREPARATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON
REPUBLICAN AND NATIONAL LEVEL; COMPILATION OF UNION CATALOGUES AND THEIR
AUTOMATION; COORDINATION OF EXISTING LIBRARY-INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND
UTILISATION OF INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS (AGRIS, INIS, MEDLARS ETC.).
DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL MANPOWER FOR INFORMATION SERVICE' A MODEL.
     
DEFINES THE PLACE OF THE INFORMATION SERVICE SYSTEM IN A TOTAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF INDIAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ANALYSES THE
IMPLICATIONS OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TAKES NOTE OF THE EXPECTATIONS FROM
A PROFESSIONAL TO BE ENGAGED IN AN INFORMATION SERVICE. ENUMERATES THE
NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT AN INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL
MUST POSSESS. PROPOSES A DESIGN OF A PROFESSIONAL MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM
SPECIFYING THE PARTICIPATING AGENCIES AND A FULL COMPLEMENT OF PROGRAMMES AT
DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT CAN ENSURE THE REQUIRED QUALITY AND QUANTITY.
LONG-RANGE PROGRAM FOR LIBRARY SERVICE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. REVISED.
     
THE PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT (1980-1984) WAS DEVELOPED TO IMPLEMENT
THE PROVISIONS OF THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT (LSCA) WHICH
PROVIDE FOR FEDERAL AID TO ASSIST THE STATES IN (1) ESTABLISHING, EXTENDING,
AND IMPROVING PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN DEVELOPING AREAS' (2) CONSTRUCTING
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, (3) PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND OTHER
DISADVANTAGED PERSONS; (4) STRENGTHENING THE STATE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENCY; AND (5) PROMOTING INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.

ACTION TO MEET THESE NEEDS ARE PRESENTED IN THIS UPDATE OF THE TEXAS STATE
LIBRARY'S 5 YEAR PLAN. OBJECTIVES FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS CENTRE AROUNG
DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, THE DISADVANTAGED, THE
HANDICAPPED, AND FOR INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, PLANS OF ACTION ARE PRESENTED
FOR INCREASED VIDEO AND FILM RESOURCES AND FOR EXPANDED LIBRARY COOPERATION
NETWORKS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT IN FEDERAL LIBRARIES' A HANDBOOK.
     
(TEXT IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH.) THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS COMMITTEE OF THE
COUNCIL OF FEDERAL LIBRARIES WAS FORMED IN 1976 TO STUDY AND ASSESS THE IMPACT
OF INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS ON THE CANADIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LIBRARY
NETWORK, AND IN 1976 IT APPOINTED A WORKING GROUP ON PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
TO EXAMINE FEDERAL LIBRARY PERFORMANCE AND TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND
USE OF MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES IN FEDERAL LIBRARIES. FULFILS THE GROUPS FIRST 2
TASKS' OFFERS A COMPENDIUM OF INFORMATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE CONCEPT OF
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF PERFORMANCE
MEASURE ACTIVITIES IN FEDERAL LIBRARIES. THE HANDBOOK IS INTENDED AS A TOOL TO
AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PARTICULAR MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
OR SYSTEMS IN FEDERAL LIBRARIES.
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND INNOVATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 4 NORTH AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TO ASSESS
JERALD HAGE AND MICHAEL AIKEN'S THEORY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
STRUCTURAL VARIABLE COMPLEXITY AND RATE OF INNOVATION IS POSITIVE AND THAT IT
IS NEGATIVE FOR CENTRALISATION, FORMALISATION, AND STRATIFICATION. FINDINGS
SUPPORT THE THEORY AND THE METHODOLOGY, WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS, WAS SHOWN TO
BE TRANSFERABLE.
LIBRARY DATA COLLECTION HANDBOOK.
     
DESCRIBES BASIC MANAGEMENT INFORMATION USEFUL IN ACADEMIC, PUBLIC, SCHOOL, AND
SPECIAL LIBRARIES. AN UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THE HANDBOOK IS THAT ALL TYPES OF
LIBRARIES HAVE A COMMON SET OF FUNCTIONS, PURPOSES, AND RESOURCES WHICH
OUTWEIGH THE DIFFERENCES IN SETTING, SIZE, OR ORGANISATIONAL GOALS. PRESENTS A
SET OF CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE JUDGED TO BE IMPORTANT IN DESCRIBING
THE LIBRARY, AND PROVIDES DEFINITION OF THOSE CATEGORIES.
TOWARDS PROBLEM-ORIENTED INFORMATION SYSTEM' A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR INFORMATION
ORGANISATION IN U.S.
     
DISCUSSES A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED IN THE USA THAT SUGGESTS A NEW PERSPECTIVE
FOR ORGANISING INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR PROBLEM-SOLVING. THE ORGANISING
PRINCIPLE IS SCIENCE, TECHNICAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION (STSI) FOR THIS
PURPOSE. EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE OF THIS STUDY TO THE SITUATION OBTAINING IN
INDIA.
MALPRACTICE LIABILITY' MYTH OR REALITY.
     
MALPRACTICE MAY BE DEFINED AS ANY PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT OR UNREASONABLE LACK
OF SKILL IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES THROUGH INTENTIONAL
CARELESSNESS OR SIMPLE IGNORANCE. ARGUES THAT LIBRARIANS AS PROFESSIONALS
COULD POSSIBLY BE SUED FOR MALPRACTICE, ALTHOUGH SUCH A CASE HAS NOT YET
OCCURRED. SUGGESTS MEANS BY WHICH LIBRARIANS MAY HELP TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY
OF MALPRACTICE. CONCLUDES THAT THE LIBRARY PROFESSION MUST MAKE RENEWED
EFFORTS TOWARD IMPROVING THE COMPETENCY OF THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONER.
POLICY MANUAL. EUGENE PUBLIC LIBRARY, LIBRARY BOARD, EUGENE, OREGON.
     
PREPARED FOR THE LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY BOARD; THIS POLICY MANUAL GOVERNS THE
OPERATIONS OF THE LIBRARY AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LIBRARIES AND THE
COMMUNITY. THE MANUAL OPENS WITH A SHORT HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY AND A
STATEMENT OF THE BYLAWS OF THE LIBRARY BOARD, INCLUDING EXCERPTS FROM THE CITY
CODE. A STATEMENT OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR 1979 IS PROVIDED, AND OPERATING
POLICIES ARE PRESENTED IN SEPARATE SECTIONS ON MATERIALS SELECTION, EXHIBITS,
PRIVACY OF RECORDS, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR LIBRARY EMPLOYEES, REGULATIONS
AFFECTING THE PUBLIC, RULES FOR THE USE OF THE LIBRARY BY GROUPS, AND A
STATEMENT ENDORSING COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ON THE ART OF MANAGEMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A PROLEGOMENON.
     
DISCUSSES 3 ASPECTS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY' MANAGING
RELATIONS OF THE LIBRARY WITH THE REST OF THE INSTITUTION (INVOLVING THE
LIBRARY IN THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INSTITIONAL OBJECTIVES);
MANAGING CONFLICTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY (THE MOST APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE BEING A
CONSULTATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE STYLE DISTINGUISHED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF
AUTHORITY RATHER THAN RELIANCE ON LEGISLATED POWER); AND MANAGING CHANGES
WROUGHT BY TECHNOLOGY (PERCEIVING TECHNOLOGY AS A MORE EFFICIENT MEANS FOR
OBTAINING THE LIBRARY'S TRADITIONAL GOALS).
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO LIBRARIES.
     
THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF BULGARIA IS TO TRANSFORM ALL BULGARIAN
CITIZENS INTO HARMONIOUS PERSONALITIES. THIS EFFORT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL
PARTICIPATION BY LIBRARIES, BOTH PUBLIC AND SPECIAL. THE NUMBER OF READERS AND
FREQUENCY OF LOANS MUST BE MONITORED. THUS LIBRARIANS MUST BECOME FAMILIAR NOT
ONLY WITH THEIR READERS' INTERESTS BUT ALSO WITH THE DETAILS OF THE LITERATURE
PRESENTED TO THEM. LIBRARIANS MUST NOT BE LEFT ALONE BUT ASSISTED AND GUIDED
EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE BY EXPERT ADVISERS, WORKING IN PARTICULAR AT THE
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES OF REGIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. THEIR WORK MUST BE
ADAPTED TO THE NEW, MUCH MORE COMPLICATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1980S AND BE
MORE EFFICIENT, TOO. BUREAUCRACY AND FORMALISM HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED,
ACTIVITIES MUCH BETTER COORDINATED. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY
IN SOFIA MUST RETAIN LEADERSHIP IN THIS FIELD.
SERIAL COST EFFICIENCY-A MODEL AND CASE STUDY (IN HEBREW).
     
HIGH RATE INFLATION IN PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BUDGET
INCREMENTS FORCE MANY LIBRARIES TO FREEZE NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN MANY CASES
TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS. THE PROCESS OF DESELECTION RAISES THE QUESTION OF
WHICH TITLES WILL BE RETAINED AND WHICH WILL BE DISCONTINUED. SUGGESTS THAT
THE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS TITLES WILL BE DONE
BY USING A COST EFFICIENCY FORMULA. THE FORMULA COMBINES 2 FACTORS, THE PRICE
OF SUBSCRIPTION AND THE MEASURED USE OF THE JOURNAL, AND RANKS PERIODICALS IN
A GIVEN COLLECTION IN A DESCENDING ORDER' AT THE TOP WILL BE THE MOST
COST-EFFICIENT TITLE AND AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST COST-EFFICIENT TITLE. THIS
FORMULA WAS TRIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A USE STUDY OF THE JUDAICA READING
ROOM'S OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DURING 1978.
LIBRARY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS 2' PLANNING TECHNIQUES.
     
THE SYSTEMS ANALYST MUST 1ST LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND ITS
SHORTCOMINGS, THEN FIND OUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS.
BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE TECHNIQUES OF INTERVIEWING, INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS,
OBSERVATION AND DATA RECORDING.
SOME THOUGHTS ON THE FINANCING OF LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT SAVING MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY CUTTING ITS LIBRARY BUDGET IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE ARGUMENT IS APPLIED TO SUCH AREAS AS STAFF CUTS AND
PROCESSING BACKLOGS, SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE LEADING TO UNDERMINING OF
THE LIBRARY'S SUPPORTIVE ROLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S TEACHING AND RESEARCH
FUNCTION. ARGUES THAT RATIONALISATION OF SUBJECT INTERESTS AND SUBJECTS TAUGHT
BY THE UNIVERSITIES IN AN AREA SHOULD LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.
THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE LIMPING SADLY BEHIND-SHOWS NEW REPORT ON THE
CONDITIONS OF RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
     
ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED IN APRIL 81 BY THE RESEARCH SECRETARIAT, DENMARK
LAGS BEHIND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ITS SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH, BOTH PUBLIC
AND PRIVATE. THE REPORT DEALS SEPARATELY WITH RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND DESCRIBES
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CUTS BOTH FOR LIBRARIES AND THEIR MOTHER INSTITUTIONS;
IT SHOWS THAT THE LIBRARIES USE LESS THAN 10% OF THE EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH.
INCLUDES COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE JOINT
COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
RESEARCH LIBRARIES' ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH,
AND PREFERABLY BEFORE, ANY CHANGE IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT. IT POINTS
OUT THAT FIGURES FOR RUNNING COSTS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER THE CULTURAL
MINISTRY, AFTER ADJUSTMENT, SHOW A GREATER FALL THAN OF THOSE UNDER THE
EDUCATION MINISTRY.
LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE ON READING MATERIALS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION,
WEST BERLIN, 15-20 DEC 80. IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE AVERAGE CITIZEN
IS POOR AND ILLITERATE AND 90% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WHERE
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN MOST
UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE FINANCIAL BUDGET ALLOCATED TO LIBRARY STAFF AND
BOOKSTOCK IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN ADDITION, IN SOME COUNTRIES CONSIDERABLE
SUMS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITY LIBRARIES TO U.K. AND U.S.A.
STANDARDS WITH A CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN FUNDS FOR RURAL AREAS. THE AVAILABLE
RESOURCES SHOULD BE DIVIDED MORE EVENLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SERVICES
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
ANDREW CARNEGIE'S ROLE IN AMERICAN PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
(PHD DISSERTATION-UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN). OVER $40 MILLION IN CARNEGIE GRANTS
WAS DONATED TO 1,412 US COMMUNITIES BETWEEN 1886 AND 1917. ANALYSES THESE
GRANTS IN DETAIL; DESCRIBES THE MECHANISM OF GRANT DISTRIBUTION; PAINTS
PORTRAITS OF THE LEADING PEOPLE INVOLVED; AND EVALUATES ANDREW CARNEGIE'S
EFFECT ON US PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, CONCLUDING THAT HIS INFLUENCE IS
STILL BEING FELT.
THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO CCNY GRANTS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND LIBRARIANSHIP HAD MUCH IN COMMON IN THE 1930S,
STEMMING FROM A COMMON UK TRADITION, YET EACH COUNTRY MADE QUITE A DIFFERENT
RESPONSE TO THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK AID PROGRAMME TO STIMULATE
LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. THE NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE WAS MUCH MORE POSITIVE AND MANY
DEVELOPMENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE 1930S-40S; IN AUSTRALIA, SOME EQUIVALENT
DEVELOPMENTS WERE NOT ACCOMPLISHED UNTIL THE 1960S. EXAMINES THE REASONS FOR
THIS.
ON THE QUESTION OF CHARGING FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
A STATEMENT FROM THE DEUTSCHER BIBLIOTHEKSVERBAND (GERMAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION.) THE CHARGES UNDER DISCUSSION ARE FOR THE LOAN OF BOOKS,
PERIODICALS AND OTHER MEDIA, AND DO NOT REFER TO SPECIAL SERVICES SUCH AS
PHOTOCOPYING. THE ASSOCIATION IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO CHARGES BEING MADE FOR
BASIC SERVICES WHICH IT REGARDS AS A RETROGRADE STEP THAT COULD ONLY HARM THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE AND DETRACT FROM ITS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL VALUE IN
THE COMMUNITY. THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY POSSIBLE FINANCIAL
GAIN.
THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN ENGLAND' INCREASING DEMAND FOR SELF-FINANCING OF
SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS.
     
EXAMINES THE STATE OF LIBRARIES IN THE UK. DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ESPECIALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CUTS RESULTING IN FEWER
ACQUISITIONS, CLOSURE OF BRANCHES, REDUCED OPENING HOURS AND FREEZING OF STAFF
POSTS. AT THE SAME TIME ATTEMPTS ARE MADE TO INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASED
FINES AND SALE OF DISCARDED MATERIAL AND PAMPHLETS, ALTHOUGH LENDING FEES HAVE
NOT YET BEEN IMPOSED. INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES IS SEEN BY MANY
AS A MEANS OF REDUCING STAFF EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC,
ESPECIALLY COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY PROVISION FOR CHILDREN, NEVER
VERY GOOD COMPARED TO DANISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HAS BEEN STRUCK PARTICULARLY
HARD BY THE CUTS. THE REACTION AGAINST THE CUTS HAS BEEN LED BY NALGO IN THE
FORM OF WORK STOPPAGES AND BY THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS PROTESTS TO THE
AUTHORITIES.
WE MUST PRESENT THE FULL BREADTH OF THE SWEDISH BOOK MARKET.
     
INTERVIEWS JAN GUMPERT, DIRECTOR OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE, WHO DISCUSSES
THE IMPACT OF CUTS ON THE LIBRARIES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE FINDING THEIR
CULTURAL BUDGETS, WITH LIBRARIES AS THE LARGEST ITEM, EASY TARGETS. ATTEMPTS
ARE MADE TO SAVE THE BOOK BUDGET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND CUTS ARE MADE INSTEAD
IN OPENING HOURS AND ACTIVITIES. VACANCIES ARE LIKELY TO BE FROZEN. FOR THE
LIBRARY SERVICE THE CUTS MEAN THAT THE STOCK OF OLDER TITLES WILL HAVE TO BE
REDUCED, BUT THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CUT THE NUMBER OF TITLES OFFERED. EXPORT OF
LIBRARY FURNITURE TO THE ARAB WORLD ALLEVIATES SOMEWHAT THE LACK OF MARKETS IN
SWEDEN. THE SERVICE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, BUMS, IS NOW INSTALLED IN 34 LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. THERE IS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES'
AUTOMATION SYSTEM LIBRIS. DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE LITERATURE COMMISSION
AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMISSION.
A CHOICE BETWEEN QUALITY OR QUANTITY' THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RECRUITMENT BAN
IN ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
SINCE THE WORLD WAR II THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS
UNDERGONE A PERIOD OF RAPID GROWTH. IN MANY TOWNS, NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES AND
BRANCH LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN OPENED AND SPECIAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN INITIATED,
SUCH AS MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES, RECORD LIBRARIES AND SERVICES TO FOREIGN
WORKERS AND OPEN SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT PLANS TO
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES FROM 13 TO 19. HOWEVER,
ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARY,
IS COMPELLED BY FINANCIAL CUTBACKS TO REDUCE ITS PRESENT STAFFING LEVELS BY
25%. AS A RESULT THE LIBRARY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT VOLUME OF
LOANS AND CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH A
BORROWER MAY TAKE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND TO REFUSING TO ENROL NEW MEMBERS.
WORD PROCESSING' AN INTRODUCTION AND APPRAISAL.
     
IDENTIFIES AND DESCRIBES THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR MECHANISING AND
AUTOMATING LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES USING WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS-TEXT
STORAGE AND SEARCHING, ORDER PROCESSING AND BUDGET CONTROL, PREPARATION OF
CATALOGUES, CIRCULATION CONTROL, PERIODICALS CONTROL AND CIRCULATION,
INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM USE, AND POSSIBLE FUTURE USES.
COMMUNICATIONS USING WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS.
     
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN WORD PROCESSOR EQUIPMENT IS REVIEWED EXTENSIVELY.
SURVEYS COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS AND NETWORKS. SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES TO LINK
WORD PROCESSORS ARE DESCRIBED, LEADING INTO A DISCUSSION OF ELECTRONIC MAIL
AND TELECONFERENCING.
INDISPENSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS IN AUTOMATING LIBRARY TECHNIQUES.
     
LIBRARIES, DESPITE THEIR TRADITION-MINDED REPUTATION, ALWAYS WERE SENSIBLE
ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DUTIES AND OPEN TO INNOVATIONS.
CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES HERE IS DISCUSSED. THESE
SYSTEMS USUALLY ARE NOT DEVELOPED ON UNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES,
BUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM PRINCIPLES ALREADY EXISTING IN OTHER APPLICATIONS.
SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE MORE APT FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES THAN OTHERS
REGARDING THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS THEIR USERS. THIS FACT TODAY
SEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED WHEN LIBRARIES DECIDE ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF
AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM.
RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN TAIWAN.
     
HIGHLIGHTS THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARY
AUTOMATION HELD IN TAIPEI, 14-19 FEB 81 AND SUMMARISES THE KEY PAPERS WHICH
REPORT SUCH IMPORTANT RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER
INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES FOR CHINESE SCRIPTS, THE DESIGN OF A CROSS-REFERENCE
INPUT OF CHINESE CHARACTERS, THE COMPILATION OF 2CHINESE CHARACTER CODE FOR
INFORMATION INTERCHANGE1, THE COMPLETE REVISION OF 2CHINESE CATALOGUING
RULES1, THE ADOPTION OF CHINESE MARC FORMAT, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
PROTOTYPE ON-LINE CATALOGUING SYSTEM. THE IMPACT OF THESE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS
WHICH WERE ACCOMPLISHED IN A RECORD TIME OF 8 MONTHS WILL BE FAR REACHING FOR
LIBRARIES IN TAIWAN AND THOSE ABROAD THAT HAVE LARGE CHINESE COLLECTIONS.
SERVICES BASED ON THE DANISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE SAMKAT SYSTEM.
     
DESCRIBES THE MECHANISATION PLANS OF THE DANISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE
WAY TO THEIR REALISATION. OUTLINES THE FAUST PROGRAMME FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES-THE DEVELOPMENT, SOURCES AND SERVICES OF THIS DATA BANK. DESCRIBES
HOW SAMKAT, THE COMPUTERISED SYSTEM FOR DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES NEEDS TO BE
IN ACCORDANCE AND COOPERATE WITH THE FAUST PROGRAMME.
GOTEBORG CITY LIBRARY AND ITS COMPUTERISED LENDING SYSTEM.
     
A DESCRIPTION OF GOTEBORG CITY LIBRARY, SWEDEN FOLLOWING A STUDY TOUR.
DESCRIBES THE STOCK AND SUBJECT SPECIALISATIONS OF THE LIBRARY; ITS
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SUPPLIER, BIBLIOTEKSTJANST; THE
INTEGRATED PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM, BUMS; THE LIBRARY'S CATALOGUES AND
COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING; AND THE OPERATION OF THE PLESSEY COMPUTERISED
LENDING SYSTEM.
IN TOUCH WITH THE FUTURE.
     
DESCRIBES EVANSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1978 THE LIBRARY
INSTALLED AN ON-LINE ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM BY CLSI. WITH AUTHOR AND TITLE DATA
ALREADY IN THE DATA BASE, THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESS
CATALOGUE WITH A TOUCH SENSITIVE TERMINAL, OPENED IN OCT 80, WAS FACILITATED.
THE CARD CATALOGUE IS, HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED, AS THE INPUT OF SUBJECT DATA
IS NOT YET COMPLETE AND AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST COMPUTER BREAK-DOWNS. THE EXTRA
COSTS INVOLVED HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN, AND SAVINGS ON STAFF ARE NOT YET
POSSIBLE. IT IS, THEREFORE, DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE LONG-TERM SAVINGS FROM
AUTOMATION. THE PROFESSIONAL GAINS ARE, HOWEVER, CLEAR' THE CATALOGUE ENABLES
PRECISE LOCATION OF MATERIAL AND COMPILATION OF USEFUL STATISTICS, AND
SIMPLIFIES ALTERATIONS. MOREOVER, TERMINALS CAN BE PLACED OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY,
IN THE TOWN HALL AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
WHERE ARE THE FACTS OF YESTERYEAR?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE QUEBEC ARCHIVISTS'
ASSOCIATION BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CANADIAN PUBLIC ARCHIVES, DISCUSSING
THE EFFECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION ON INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION, AND THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES FOR FUTURE ARCHIVES, WHEN
INFORMATION STORED ON MAGNETIC TAPE CAN VERY EASILY BE RUBBED OUT,
ACCIDENTALLY OR INTENTIONALLY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IS
TRACED FROM THE TIME OF PASCAL TO THE PRESENT, AND THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS
DESCRIBED IN DETAIL, WITH REFERENCE TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS IN
CANADA. SOME EXPLANATIONS ARE GIVEN OF MACHINE READABLE CATALOGUES AND THEIR
OPERATION, TOGETHER WITH THE TERMINOLOGY GENERATED. EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE
ARCHIVIST IN CONSTRUCTION OF MACHINE READABLE CATALOGUES AND THEIR
ORGANISATION IN RELATION TO CLASSIFICATION, CONSERVATION AND ACCESS. IN
CONCLUSION, WEIGHS THE OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATION AGAINST ITS POTENTIAL
HAZARDS AND PROBLEMS FOR THE ARCHIVIST OF THE FUTURE, WITH REFERENCE TO THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES.
GEAC; A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.
     
DESCRIBES THE GEAC COMPUTER CORPORATION'S ON-LINE LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM
AND PLANS FOR ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. STARTED IN 1977, THE SYSTEM WAS
DEVELOPED FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, BUT HAS ACCOMMODATED THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
SITUATION. IT IS ADAPTED AT SPECIFIC POINTS TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY POLICY. IT
CARRIES OUT STANDARD LIBRARY FUNCTIONS AND ALSO CONTAINS A PUBLIC QUERY MODULE
WHEREBY A PATRON (IDENTIFIED BY MEANS OF A PERSONAL BARCODE) CAN SEARCH HIS
PERSONAL RECORD OR (NO IDENTIFICATION NEEDED) THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE.
MICROCOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS.
     
OUTLINES THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION
DEPARTMENTS AND INDICATES THE LIKELY PRE-CONDITIONS WHICH MAY WELL HAVE TO
EXIST BEFORE THIS POTENTIAL CAN BE REALISED. DEFINES THE TERMS MICROPROCESSORS
AND MICROCOMPUTERS. CONCLUDES THAT CHEAP SOFTWARE WILL BE POSSIBLE WHERE
LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS ARE PREPARED TO CHANGE THEIR PROCEDURES
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
REPORTS FOR THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM (ILS).
     
THE DOCUMENT PRESENTS A SERIES OF REPORTS DEVELOPED FOR THE CIRCULATION MODULE
OF THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM (ILS). THE ILS IS A MINICOMPUTER-BASED
LIBRARY SYSTEM BEING DEVELOPED BY THE LISTER HILL NATIONAL CENTER FOR
BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE FOR USE IN
MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARIES. THE REPORTS INCLUDE CORRESPONDENCE RELATED TO
CIRCULATION, BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND MANAGEMENT REPORTS. EACH CHAPTER IN THIS
DOCUMENT DISCUSSES A SPECIFIC TYPE OF REPORT-THE STRUCTURE AND USE BY THE
LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR. FOR EACH REPORT, DATA ELEMENTS ARE NOTED AND
ALTERNATIVE FORMATS PROVIDED.
THE ETHICS OF FURTHER EDUCATION LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE LIBRARIAN'S 'CLIENTS' IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HIS
DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16-19 AGE GROUP. THE NEED FOR THE
LIBRARIAN TO HOLD THEIR DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN BALANCE
IS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR ITS
SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A BALANCED USE OF THE FACILITIES,
COVERAGE OF SUBJECT AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF
FREE ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHAT
THE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED IN
RELATION TO THIS AND OTHER CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF OPEN LEARNING IS SEEN AS
DEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE IS
AFFIRMED.
LEADERSHIP BY NONADMINISTRATORS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
LEADERSHIP BY THOSE NOT IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN LIBRARIES HAS USUALLY
BEEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT. A NUMBER OF OTHER
MODELS ARE GIVEN' PARTICIPATION AND FEEDBACK MODELS, INCLUDING THE EVALUATION
OF SUPERIORS; MODELS OF CONFRONTATION AND RISK TAKING, INCLUDING ACTION TO
OVERCOME MISMANAGEMENT AND ASSERTION OF EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS; AND MODELS FOR
CHANGE AGENTS, INCLUDING USE OF STAFF ORGANISATIONS, INFORMAL ACTION NETWORKS,
AND RESOURCE EXCHANGE NETWORKS. THE THEORY IS THAT A 'SERVANT LEADERSHIP' BY
LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVEL STAFF MAY PROMOTE SERVICE BY LIBRARIES AND ALSO
INCREASE ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK TO THE STAFF THEMSELVES. THE
ACTION MODELS SHOULD BE TESTED AND RELATED TO A CAREER-STAGE MODEL WHICH
IDENTIFIES POWER AND INFLUENCE BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT MANAGERS.
RESOURCE NOTEBOOK ON STAFF DEVELOPMENT.
     
FOCUSES ON LIBRARY STAFF DEVELOPMENT. THE INTRODUCTION PROVIDES BACKGROUND AND
A BRIEF CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT. THE FIRST SECTION OF
DOCUMENTS PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF DATA GATHERING TOOLS AND APPROACHES TO
GATHERING INFORMATION. THE SECOND GROUP OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATES METHODS OF
DESCRIBING AND ANALYZING CURRENT STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES, AND THE FINAL
SECTION CONTAINS EXAMPLES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW APPROACHES TO STAFF
DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE BY LIBRARIES.
STRESS' THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME QUEBEC LIBRARIANS.
     
RESULTS OF A BRIEF SURVEY BY QUESTIONNAIRE OF 90 VOLUNTEERS IDENTIFYING THE
PARAMETERS OF STRESS EXPERIENCED BY LIBRARIANS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HOW THE
QUESTIONNAIRE WAS COMPILED, AND SELECTION OF THE SAMPLE. RESEARCH IN THE FIELD
TO DATA IS SUMMARISED TO EXPLAIN THE THEORETICAL MODEL USED. RESULTS COVER THE
COMPOSITION OF THE SURVEY POPULATION BY TYPE OF LIBRARY; FREQUENCY OF
PERCEPTION OF STRESS AND EFFECT ON WORK; THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL FACTORS,
SUCH AS LIFE EVENTS, WORKING ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, AND
BUREAUCRATIC ASPECTS AT WORK; AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL FACTORS ON
BEHAVIOUR IN THE WORK SITUATION. ADVICE IS OFFERED IN CONCLUSION ON HOW TO
AVOID STRESS AND MINIMISE ITS EFFECTS.
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IN THE LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES HEALTH PROBLEMS AND OCCUPATIONAL STRESSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE
LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT. IDENTIFIES HEALTH COMPLAINTS RELATED TO INADEQUATE
LIGHTING (A COMMON PROBLEM), USE OF PHOTOCOPYING AND DUPLICATING MACHINES (A
HIGH RISK ACTIVITY), AND USE OF VISUAL DISPLAY UNITS (A PARTICULAR CONCERN OF
UNIONS). MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OR CONTROL OF SUCH
COMPLAINTS. STATES THE US LEGAL POSITION IN THIS AREA, SUGGESTS HOW LIBRARY
STAFF CAN TAKE THE INITIATIVE, AND PROVIDES A READING LIST.
TRAVEL POLICIES OF TWENTY-ONE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
IN A RECENT SURVEY, ACRL FOUND THAT COLLEGE AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE
DEVELOPING FORMAL WRITTEN POLICIES FOR STAFF TRAVEL AND ARE UPGRADING EXISTING
POLICIES. PRESENTS 21 REPRESENTATIVE POLICIES WHICH DISPLAY A WIDE VARIETY OF
INSTITUTIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THE ALLOCATION OF TIME AND FUNDS FOR LIBRARY
EMPLOYEES' PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS AND OTHER CONTINUING EDUCATION
ACTIVITIES.
FREELANCE LIBRARIANS IN QUEBEC.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE FREELANCE BRANCH OF THE LIBRARIANSHIP PROFESSION. THE
NATURE OF THE FREELANCE LIBRARIAN'S WORK IS DESCRIBED, AND THIS OCCUPATION
DISTINGUISHED FROM THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL LIBRARIAN. RELEVANT LITERATURE TO
DATE IS DISCUSSED, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO QUEBEC. THE SURVEY RESULTS
PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE FREELANCE LIBRARIAN'S SITUATION IN
QUEBEC' CONDITIONS OF WORK, DEMAND FOR SERVICES, SERVICES OFFERED, RESEARCH
PROCEDURES, AND RATES CHARGED. THE CONCLUSION DRAWN IS THAT THIS NEW BRANCH OF
THE PROFESSION IS A FUNCTIONAL COMPLEMENT TO EXISTING TYPES.
DOUGLAS MCGREGOR VISITS JAIPUR INFORMATION CENTRE. MORE OF 'Y' AND LESS OF 'X'
IS THE ANSWER. A CASE STUDY.
     
PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF MCGREGOR'S THEORIES OF MOTIVATION AND SEEKS TO EXAMINE
THEIR RELEVANCE AND FEASIBILITY IN THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
IN INDIA. THE JAIPUR INFORMATION CENTRE WAS CHOSEN FOR A SYSTEMATIC
APPLICATION OF MCGREGOR'S 'X' AND 'Y' THEORIES. CONCLUDES THAT THE RESULTS OF
THE STUDY SHOW THE THEORIES TO BE RELEVANT TO INDIAN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
THE REPORT OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION 1980/81.
     
THE REPORT DEALS WITH' THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND LIBRARIES; SALARIES;
PROFESSIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY; LIBRARY LAW REVISION;
EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; SPOKEN NEWSPAPERS; LIBRARIES AT WORK PLACES AND
TEACHER TRAINING COLLEGES; EMPLOYMENT; AND SHOP STEWARDSHIP. THE FOLLOWING
REPORTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED' REPORT OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION'S ACTION FUND
1980/81; REPORT OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION'S GROUP FOR STATE EMPLOYED LIBRARIANS

ALSO DISCUSSES THE BUDGET FOR 1982.
FOR AMERICAN LIBRARIANS TRADE UNIONS ARE NOT A GREAT ATTRACTION.
     
INTERVIEWS MARION PORRO, PRESIDENT OF THE TRADE UNION FOR LIBRARY EMPLOYEES IN
NEW YORK. THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY EMPLOYEES IN THE USA HAS NOT BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL AND TODAY ONLY ABOUT 10% OF EMPLOYEES, MOSTLY IN THE LARGE URBAN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ARE UNION MEMBERS. THIS IS, HOWEVER, IN LINE WITH THE
GENERAL SCEPTICISM TOWARDS THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AMONG AMERICANS IN GENERAL
AND THE PROFESSIONS IN PARTICULAR. THE ALA HAS ON THE WHOLE HAD AN AMBIGUOUS
ATTITUDE TO TRADE UNION MATTERS. THE TRADE UNION IN NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK
LIBRARY GUILD, OR LOCAL 1930, ESTABLISHED IN 1968, HAS ABOUT 1500 MEMBERS AND
ALMOST TOTAL COVERAGE. IT NEGOTIATES 2 YEARLY AGREEMENTS ON PAY AND CONDITIONS
AND DEALS WITH GRIEVANCES, BUT DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LIBRARY
PROFESSIONAL DECISION-MAKING. ON A WIDER FRONT, THE UNION IS ENGAGED IN
VARIOUS SOCIAL PROTEST MOVEMENTS, BUT NO COOPERATION WITH OTHER TRADE UNIONS
FOR LIBRARY EMPLOYEES TAKES PL ACE.
ROLE OF STUDENT ASSISTANTS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES AND PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE WIDESPREAD EMPLOYMENT OF
STUDENT ASSISTANTS IN INDIAN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND SUGGESTS
WAYS OF IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS PRACTICE.

PROVIDING SPECIALISTS WITH INFORMATION. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING TIME
NORMS FOR CARRYING OUT SEPARATE INFORMATION PROCESSES.
NEW MAIN LIBRARY IN OREBRO.
     
3 ARTICLES WHICH DESCRIBE OREBRO'S NEW LIBRARY, OPENED AUG 81. EVA VIIRMAN
DESCRIBES HOW IN 1976, A LIST OF CULTURAL OBJECTIVES FOR A LIBRARY SERVICE,
ITS FUNCTIONS AND USER GROUPS WERE HANDED TO THE ARCHITECTS, WHO WORKED OUT A
PROPOSAL ON THE BASIS OF THESE. THE LIBRARY SHARES THE BUILDING WITH THE LOCAL
COUNCIL'S CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEES, THE RESOURCES AND AV CENTRES.

DEPARTMENTS. IN THE BASEMENT ARE STUDY CARRELS AND STACKS WITH 200,000
VOLUMES. IN ALL, AN OPEN AND WELL ARRANGED LIBRARY. THE ARCHITECT, HUGO HOIJE
DESCRIBES HOW THE AIMS OF FLEXIBILITY AND OPENNESS ARE MET BY A CONSTRUCTION
WITHOUT SUPPORTING WALLS. THE ANGULAR SHAPED EXTERIO R FOLLOWS THE TRADITIONAL
INNER CITY PLAN AND CREATES A YARD FOR SERVICE VEHICLES. ANTS VIIRMAN
DESCRIBES THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE MOVE TO THE NEW LIBRARY, WHICH INCLUDED A
TOTAL SURVEY OF THE MEDIA STOCK AND SOME WITHDRAWALS, AND THE MOVE ITSELF.
KARLSRUHE' CULTURE IN THE PALACE.
     
IN MAY 81 THE FORMER PALACE OF THE GRAND DUKES OF BADEN WAS OPENED TO THE
PUBLIC AS A CULTURAL CENTRE. THE WORK OF ADAPTING THE 19TH CENTURY BUILDING
FOR THIS PURPOSE BEGAN IN 1978. ON THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE LIBRARY FOR
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE, CONTAINING 30,000 VOLUMES WHICH WERE MOVED HERE
WHEN PREMISES IN THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY BECAME TOO SMALL. THE 1ST FLOOR HOUSES
THE MUNICIPAL ART GALLERY, SPECIALISING IN GERMAN PAINTINGS FROM 1850 ONWARDS
AND THE 2ND FLOOR THE LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTION. THERE ARE ALSO ROOMS FOR
MEETINGS, FILM SHOWS AND PAINTING SESSIONS, OFFICES, A CAFETERIA AND A MEDIA
CENTRE CONTAINING OVER 3,000 CASSETTES AND RECORDS. SINCE ITS OPENING THE
CENTRE HAS ACHIEVED INCREASES IN LOANS, READERS AND VISITORS TO THE ART
GALLERY.
THE NEW LIBRARY IN NORA.
     
DESCRIBES NORA'S NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY OPENED IN JAN 81. NORA HAS 10,000
INHABITANTS AND IS WITHIN COMMUTING DISTANCE OF OREBRO. THE LIBRARY WAS BUILT
IN THE TOWN CENTRE AND THE EXTERIOR FITS IN WELL WITH THE OLD SURROUNDINGS. IT
OCCUPIES 1000 SQ.M. BUILDING SHARED WITH 2 BUSINESS COMPANIES. ALL PUBLIC

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE PROMOTING AND PUBLICISING LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES, ASLIB, LONDON, 16 MAR 81. A THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF
THE RATIONALE BEHIND LIBRARY PROMOTION, CONCENTRATING ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
STRESSES THE NEED FOR INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATION IN THIS TIME OF DEVELOPING
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO KEEP ONE STEP AHEAD OF SOCIAL TRENDS AND
EXPECTATIONS SO THAT APPROPRIATE SERVICE RESPONSES CAN BE DEVELOPED AND A
SOCIETAL OR ORGANISATION DEPENDENCE ON THE LIBRARY CREATED. DESCRIBES HOW
PUBLIC LIBRARIES COULD DEVELOP THEIR SERVICES TO BECOME INSTITUTIONS OF
CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE THAT ARE CARING.
SPORTS SPLASH' 1980. A LIBRARIAN'S PLANNING HANDBOOK.T
     
HIS HANDBOOK HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS AN AID FOR LIBRARIANS IN PLANNING SUMMER
1980 READING PROGRAMMES ON A SPORTS THEME FOR CHILDREN. THE PROGRAMME
ENCOURAGES CHILDREN TO VISIT THE LIBRARY, BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ITS RESOURCES
AND PROMOTE READING AND ENJOYMENT OF BOOKS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
OPTIMAL OPENING HOURS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
DESPITE RECENT INCREASES IN STOCKS AND READERSHIP, PUBLIC LIBRARIES MUST
ATTAIN EVEN HIGHER STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE USED BY ONLY
A SMALL PROPORTION OF INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS, APPRENTICES AND
SCHOOLCHILDREN; ONE WAY TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF THEM TO USE LIBRARIES COULD BE TO
MAKE OPENING HOURS LONGER AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY IN THE
EVENING. LIBRARIES COULD RESERVE THE MORNINGS AND EARLY AFTERNOONS FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING WORK AND THEN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AT LEAST TILL 6
P.M., DEPENDING ON LOCAL CONDITIONS. ALL DEPARTMENTS FOR PUBLIC USE SHOULD BE
OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY AND STAFF TRAINING MUST BE DEVELOPED SO THAT EXPERT
ASSISTANCE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.
THE GERMAN EXPERIENCE' A CASE STUDY IN LIBRARY PROMOTION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE PROMOTING AND PUBLICISING LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES, LONDON, ASLIB, 16 MAR 81. DURING RECENT YEARS THE MOST
APPARENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO WEST GERMAN LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS WERE SOME
APPROACHES TOWARDS A CORPORATE VISUAL IDENTITY FOR A PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM.
COLOUR SLIDES ILLUSTRATED THE GRAPHIC CONCEPTIONS DEVELOPED FOR AND
CONSEQUENTLY APPLIED BY THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES OF COLOGNE AND WUPPERTAL AS
WELL AS A MORE RECENT PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE AND
FINANCED BY A GOVERNMENT GRANT. INDICATES THE WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS TO BE
CONSIDERED. STRESSES THAT ANY GRAPHIC CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD BE SEEN IN CONTEXT
WITH OTHER SINGLE ASPECTS OF LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS AND MUST ALSO BE BASED
ON AN INTEGRATED PR POLICY IN LINE WITH A LIBRARY'S GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND
THE IMAGE DESIRED.
CREATING AN IDENTITY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE PROMOTING AND PUBLICISING LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES, LONDON, ASLIB, 16 MAR 81. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES, WITH

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON INFORMATION
SERVICES.
     
FOLLOWING A REMINDER OF WHAT TELECOMMUNICATION INVOLVES, THE FEATURES AND
CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS TRANSMISSION MEDIA ARE REVIEWED. THESE COMPRISE
WIRE OR CABLE MEDIA BOTH METALLIC (TWISTED PAIRS AND COAXIAL CABLE) AND
NONMETALLIC (OPTICAL FIBRES) AS WELL AS FREE SPACE PROPAGATION METHODS SUCH AS
TV BROADCASTING AND MICROWAVE RADIO. ALSO DISCUSSES THE TECHNIQUES IN
NETWORKING USING THESE MEDIA AND DESCRIBES SYSTEMS AND SERVICES WHICH, IN
THEIR EVOLUTION ARE MAKING USE OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS.
THESE INCLUDE VIDEOTEX, TELETEXT, CATV, THE ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY, ELECTRONIC
MAIL AND MESSAGING, TELECONFERENCING AND TELEWRITING, FACSIMILE, NETWORKS AND
DATA BASE HANDLING. THE IMPACT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS, BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND
RESULTING SYSTEMS, ARE HAVING ON INFORMATION SERVICES IS EXAMINED FROM THE
POINT OF VIEW OF USER REACTIONS, BENEFITS, PROBLEMS AND EFFECTS. STRESSES THAT
INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE BECOME MUCH BROADER IN SCOPE THAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN
UNDERSTOOD BY TRADITIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES AND THEY NOW
INCLUDE SERVICES PREPARED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DOMESTIC AND BUSINESS MARKETS.
THE MODERNIZATION OF INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
     
CHINA HAS SUFFERED FROM OVER A DECADE OF TURMOIL WHICH HAS PREVENTED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN INFORMATION SERVICES. PRESENT POLICY STRESSES THE ROLE
OF INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. APART FROM
TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS, CHINA FACES A SERIOUS HANDICAP WITH ITS
UNIQUE WRITTEN LANGUAGE, WHERE THE 5000 PLUS CHARACTERS NEEDED TO EXPRESS
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONCEPTS ARE TOO LARGE TO BE HANDLED COST-EFFECTIVELY
BY PRESENT COMPUTERS. THIS REPORT OUTLINES WAYS IN WHICH CHINA IS CURRENTLY
ATTEMPTING TO MEET THESE PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE FOR MODERN INFORMATION SERVICES
BY THE END OF THE DECADE.
THE STATUS OF IRANIAN INFORMATION SCIENCE.
     
PROVIDES A CONCISE HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT OF IRANIAN INFORMATION SCIENCE IN
THE PAST 2 DECADES. TRACES PROGRESS FROM EARLY INDEXING PROJECTS TO
INTERACTIVE DATA BASE SEARCHING. ASSESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY COURSE WORK,
AN EARLY SOPHISTICATED TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRE, AND THE IRANIAN
DOCUMENTATION CENTRE'S EXTENSIVE ACTIVITIES.
SOVIET-CZECH SEMINAR ON INFORMATION WORK IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
INFORMATION WORK IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE 2ND SOVIET-CZECH
SEMINAR THAT TOOK PLACE IN PRAGUE IN NOV 79. MAIN TOPICS OF THE PROCEEDINGS
WERE' THE WORK OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH POLITICAL LITERATURE; READING BY YOUNG
PEOPLE; AND THE SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF READING.
PAPERS SHOWED THAT THERE IS A SIMILARITY IN THE CZECH AND RUSSIAN APPROACH TO
THE PROMOTION OF READING. IN FUTURE BOTH COUNTRIES WILL NEED TO PAY MORE
ATTENTION TO RESEARCH INTO PUBLISHING IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
PUBLISHED MATERIALS. A RESOLUTION STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EXCHANGE OF
INFORMATION ON THE PLANNING OF FUTURE WORK AND PUBLICATIONS.
INFORMATION ACTIVITIES IN THE MAIN TECHNICAL UNIVERSITIES' LIBRARIES.
     
ANALYSES THE ACTIVITIES OF INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS IN THE MAIN TECHNICAL
UNIVERSITIES' LIBRARIES WITH REGARD TO TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT, LOCAL CONDITIONS,
AUTOMATION OF THE INFORMATION PROCESS, THE STAFF AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION,
REFERENCE COLLECTIONS, REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS AND OTHER TOOLS. THE RESPONSE TO
A SURVEY CARRIED OUT OF THE MAIN TECHNICAL UNIVERSITIES' LIBRARIES WAS USED AS
A BASIS FOR THE EVALUATION.
STUDENT INFORMATION NEEDS AND LIBRARY USER EDUCATION.
     
A SMALL GROUP OF POLYTECHNIC UNDERGRADUATES WERE INTERVIEWED OVER A 6 WEEK
PERIOD IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS AND THEIR APPROACHES TO
MEETING THEM. ACADEMIC STAFF WERE THEN INTERVIEWED TO DISCOVER THEIR
PERCEPTION OF THE STUDENTS' INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS. THE FINDINGS ARE
SUMMARISED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN SOLVING THE
STUDENTS' INFORMATION NEEDS. THE RELEVANCE OF THE FINDINGS TO THE PLANNING OF
LIBRARY USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES ARE DISCUSSED.
INDIAN WOMEN' INFORMATION NEEDS.
     
STUDY OF THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF INDIAN AND PAKISTANI WOMEN IN THE UK,
CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A MULTI-PURPOSE INFORMATION
SERVICE. DISCUSSES THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF THIS GROUP, AND IN
PARTICULAR THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF MIGRATION FROM RURAL TO URBAN AREAS AND THE
ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS OF INFORMATION ACQUISITION ESTABLISHED BY WOMEN IN
SOUTHALL, LONDON, WHERE THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT. ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE
ROLE OF THE FORMAL INFORMATION CENTRES, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AS A SERVICE TO MEET THEIR DAILY NEEDS.
THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF SPORT, PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION STAFF
AND HOW LIBRARIANS CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE.
     
THE PARTICULAR INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION STAFF IN
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE OFTEN IGNORED OR NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY
LIBRARIANS. THE SUBJECT CONCERNS OF SUCH PEOPLE EMBRACE ELEMENTS FROM ALL THE
MAJOR DISCIPLINES. A SURVEY OF STAFF INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT RESEARCH IN
SPORT, PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION IN UK UNIVERSITIES AND IN CERTAIN
POLYTECHNICS AND RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS REVEALED THAT' JUST UNDER 50% HAD NOT
USED AN ABSTRACTING/INDEXING JOURNAL IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WORK; WELL UNDER
20% HAD USED A COMPUTER-BASED SEARCH SYSTEM; 60% HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY KIND OF
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INSTRUCTION, BUT MOST OF THIS GROUP BELIEVED INSTRUCTION WOULD
HAVE HELPED THEM; 80% WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ALLOW LIBRARIANS TO CARRY OUT
LITERATURE SEARCHES; 20% COULD NOT 'READ' IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND ONLY A
MINORITY OF THOSE WHO COULD, ACTUALLY SCANN ED MATERIAL IN THE LANGUAGE.
PATENT AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION.
     
VOLUME OF PATENT LITERATURE BEING GENERATED IN THE WORLD; CHARACTERISTICS OF
PATENT INFORMATION; PATENTABILITY; PATENTESE; TOOLS FOR SEARCHING OF PATENTS;
OBJECTIVES AND SERVICES OF ORGANISATIONS LIKE WIPO, ICIREPAT, INPADOC HAVE
BEEN DESCRIBED.
DEVELOPING A FOCUS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH INTO SOCIAL SCIENCE LIBRARY, INFORMATION, AND
DOCUMENTATION PROBLEMS IS REVIEWED WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO WORK IN THE UK
SINCE THE MID-1960S. SOME VERY PROMISING LINES OF INVESTIGATION WERE OPENED UP
THROUGH FUNDED RESEARCH. SINCE THE MID-1970S, THERE HAS BEEN LESS SUPPORT FOR
WORK IN THIS FIELD, ALTHOUGH THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION,
DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION OF SERVICES. DEVELOPMENTS MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE
SPECIAL NEEDS AND NATURE OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. SOME BACKGROUND ISSUES
RELEVANT TO DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION POLICIES FOR THE DISCIPLINE
ARE DISCUSSED IN A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT. THESE MATTERS FORM THE
AGENDA FOR THE STANDING CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION (SCOSSI),
WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN 1977.
ARKANSAS PUBLIC POLICY INFORMATION SYSTEM' ARKANSAS ECONOMETRIC MODELS.
     
REPORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARKANSAS ECONOMETRIC MODELS AS PART OF AN
OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE ARKANSAS PUBLIC POLICY INFORMATION SYSTEM (APPIS).
APPIS IS DESIGNED TO BE A PROTOTYPE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY
INFORMATION SYSTEMS BY OTHER STATES. APPIS IS A SET OF ECONOMETRIC MODELS AND
DATA BASES WHICH SPECIFY PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS IN THE ARKANSAS ECONOMY.
THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY FORECASTS OF STATE EMPLOYMENT BY
2-DIGIT STANDARD INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION, SOURCES OF PERSONAL INCOME AND
DETAILED SOURCES OF STATE REVENUES.
COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF TRANSIT USE IN AREAS OF HIGH AND LOW TRAVEL DENSITY.
     
ADDRESSES SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MANNER IN WHICH INFORMATION ON
TRANSIT SYSTEMS SHOULD BE PREPARED AND DISSEMINATED. THE REPORT IS DIVIDED
INTO SIX CHAPTERS, RANGING IN TOPICS FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL BROAD-BASED
QUESTIONS OF HOW WELL URBAN RESIDENTS UNDERSTAND THEIR CITY AND THE TRANSIT
SYSTEM, TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF WHAT TO INCLUDE ON A TRANSIT MAP.
ACCESS TO LOCAL-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION.
     
DESCRIBES THE 'ACCESS TO LOCAL-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION' PROJECT CARRIED OUT
BY CAPITAL PLANNING INFORMATION IN 1979-80. THE PROJECT HAD ITS ORIGINS IN THE
PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THOSE REQUIRING ACCESS TO THE INCREASING NUMBER AND
RANGE OF DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY UK LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE PROJECT TEAM
IDENTIFIED THE DOCUMENTARY OUTPUT OF 5 LOCAL AUTHORITIES; INVESTIGATED
BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS, AUTHORITY ATTITUDES TOWARDS PUBLISHING AND
AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS; AND MEASURED THE AVAILABILITY OF THE DOCUMENTS.
FEDERAL INFORMATION CENTERS. PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE GOVERNMENT.
     
THE PURPOSE OF THE US FEDERAL INFORMATION CENTER (FIC) PROGRAMME IS TO PROVIDE
THE PUBLIC WITH A MEANS OF ACCESS TO THE GOVERNMENT. BRIEFLY SUMMARISES THE
FIC ACT AND THE PROGRAMME'S HISTORY. EXAMINES THE REPLIES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE
SURVEY OF THE 38 FICS CONCERNING VOLUME OF INQUIRIES HANDLED, SOURCES OF
INQUIRIES, METHODS OF INQUIRIES, TYPE OF REFERENCE TOOLS USED, CHOICE AND
TRAINING OF PERSONNEL, USE OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, AND USER SATISFACTION.
THE PROPOSED CANADIAN LAW ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.
     
EXAMINES THE LEGISLATION ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION PROPOSED BY THE CANADIAN
LIBERAL ADMINISTRATION, PUBLISHED IN JULY 80. SUMMARISES THE POINTS COVERED BY
THE LAW AND EXPLAINS HOW IT WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE; DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS; AND FINALLY CONSIDERS IN DETAIL WHAT THE EFFECT ON THE
PUBLIC ARCHIVES WOULD BE.
COMMUNITY WORKERS AND INFORMATION' FROM NATIONAL RESOURCES TO NEIGHBOURHOOD
ADVICE.
     
THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF COMMUNITY WORKERS IN THE UK ARE EXAMINED FROM
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ORGANISATIONAL AND PERSONAL RESTRAINTS WHICH AFFECT
THEM. SOME LOCAL POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED BY COMMUNITY
WORKERS WHEN OBTAINING AND USING INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED AS WELL AS SOME
LIMITATIONS IMPOSED THROUGH WORKING WITH SPECIFIC GROUPS. 3 APPROACHES TO
COMMUNITY WORKER INVOLVEMENT WITH NEIGHBOURHOOD INFORMATION CENTRES AND THE
MISCONCEPTION UNDERLYING THEM ARE IDENTIFIED. A FRESH APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO
PROVISION OF A NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTRE AND REGIONAL RESOURCE CENTRES FOR
USE BY COMMUNITY WORKERS.
THE VITAL LINK: INFORMATION IN SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS.
     
ACCOUNT OF THE WORK OF PROJECT INISS, A 5-YEAR INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION
NEEDS AND SERVICES IN SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS. STAGE 1 INVOLVED A
PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF HOW PEOPLE IN SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS OBTAIN
INFORMATION NEEDED TO WORK, THEIR USE OF IT AND REACTIONS IF THEY CANNOT GET
IT; IN THE 2ND STAGE, STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED OUT WITH A RANDOM
SAMPLE OF STAFF TO SEE HOW FAR THE IDEAS ENGENDERED IN THE OBSERVATION WORK
WERE SUPPORTED. THE 3RD STAGE-'FIELD TRIALS' OF SOME IDEAS FOR IMPROVING
COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION-IS NOW UNDERWAY. THE PROJECT IS BASED AT
SHEFFIELD UNIVERSITY, POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXPANDED INDIANA VOCATIONAL EDUCATION INFORMATION
SERVICES.
     
THE PROJECT DESCRIBED WAS DESIGNED TO DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE REPORTS ON
INDIANA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS ON VOCATIONAL EDUCATION TO
APPROPRIATE STATE AND NATIONAL TARGET AUDIENCES; TO IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM FOR
ACQUIRING, ORGANISING, STORING, RETRIEVING AND DISSEMINATING RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
INFORMATION USE BY TEACHERS IN A JUNIOR SCHOOL.
     
THE PROBLEM OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN EDUCATION
DERIVES IN PART FROM A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TEACHERS USE EDUCATIONAL
INFORMATION IN PRACTICE. A CASE STUDY OF THE STAFF OF 1 JUNIOR SCHOOL WAS SET
UP TO COLLECT DETAILED EVIDENCE ON INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS' INFORMATION USE, THE
INFORMAL FLOW OF INFORMATION BETWEEN TEACHERS, AND THE IMPACT OF NEW
INFORMATION ON BOTH SCHOOL AND TEACHER. ALTHOUGH STILL IN PROGRESS, THE
ANALYSIS HAS SO FAR PRODUCED A PRELIMINARY MODEL OF THE UTILISATION PROCESS IN
THE SCHOOL, INDICATING ITS COMPLEXITY AND THE RANGE OF FACTORS INVOLVED.
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE' THE SEARCH AND THE PROBLEMS.
     
GRYUB RSFSR IMENI 50-LETIYA VLKSM, (RSFSR 50TH KOMSOMOL JUBILEE STATE REPUBLIC
YOUTH LIBRARY), (SRYL), RECEIVES MANY ENQUIRIES ABOUT CAREERS. LIBRARY LIAISON
WITH SCHOOLS IS ESSENTIAL. SRYL INVESTIGATED THE RELATIONSHIP OF READING WITH
COGNITIVE INTERESTS AND PROFESSIONAL ASPIRATIONS OF 8TH-10TH FORMERS. 27.5% OF
8TH-FORMERS, 26.4% OF 9TH-FORMERS AND 42.6% OF 10TH-FORMERS HAD CHOSEN THEIR
PROFESSION. TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS PROVE INADEQUATE INFORMATION SOURCES OWING
TO IGNORANCE OF THE LITERATURE. TO HELP LIBRARIANS SRYL HAS PREPARED A
BIBLIOGRAPHY' 2ALL ABOUT JOBS. 1SRYL PLANS AN EXPERIMENT' JOINT LIBRARY AND

AN INDUSTRY INFORMATION SERVICE AS A STIMULUS FOR INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT-RUSSELLVILLE ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT AREA, ARKANSAS.
     
AN INDUSTRY INFORMATION SERVICE SEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR THE RUSSELLVILLE AREA,
ONE THAT WILL SERVE MANUFACTURING SUBCONTRACTING MARKETING NEEDS. THE APPROACH
COULD FUNCTION AS A MULTI-COUNTY CONTRACT-SUBCONTRACT MARKETING SERVICE FOR
COOPERATING MANUFACTURERS. IN THE RUSSELLVILLE AREA'S ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTIVITY, THE INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION SERVICE CAN BE A VIABLE
MARKETING TOOL FOR THE AREA.
THE INFORMATION EXPLOSION.
     
A CHAPTER FROM 2CYBERNETIC MEDLEY. 1FLOODS OF INFORMATION OVERWHELM MANKIND.
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION, (STI), DOUBLES EVERY 10 YEARS. AT THE
VSESOYUZNYI INSTITUT NAUCHNOI I TEKHNICHESKOI INFORMATSII, (ALL-UNION STI
INSTITUTE), 1,000 WORKERS MAKE THIS LITERATURE ACCESSIBLE TO SOVIET READERS.
THIS OCEAN OF KNOWLEDGE NECESSITATES A NATIONAL PLAN FOR INFORMATION
PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING. USSR HAS A CENTRALISED STATE NETWORK OF COMPUTER
CENTRES AND A STATE STI SYSTEM. THE MEZHDUNARODNYI TSENTR NAUCHO-TEKHNICHESKOI
INFORMATSII, (INTERNATIONAL STI CENTRE), SERVES SOCIALIST ALLIANCE COUNTRIES.
UNISIST IS A WORLD STI SYSTEM. INFORMATION SCIENCE USES NEW RESOURCES TO SOLVE
ITS TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. AIDS SUCH AS ELECTRONIC PENCILS, SORTERS, UNIVERSAL
INFORMATION MACHINES, LASERS, SHOULD ENABLE SCIENTISTS TO OBTAIN FULL AND
RAPID INFORMATION.
RESEARCH INTO WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES CAN BEST PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.
     
THE 1ST STAGE OF RESEARCH HAS BEEN THE DEFINITION OF THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES
WITHIN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK. FROM THERE, STUDY HAS CONTINUED ON
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LONGTERM DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION NEEDS AND
CURRENT INFORMATION WORK IN LIBRARIES. INFORMATION NEEDS CAN BE DIFFERENTIATED
ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY CAN BEST BE SATISFIED BY AUTOMATED SEARCH SYSTEMS,
OR BY TRADITIONAL METHODS. A 3RD GROUP CAN BEST BE SATISFIED THROUGH INFORMAL
CHANNELS. ALL THESE PROCEDURES CAN BE EVALUATED IN THE EVERYDAY WORK OF A
LIBRARY AND COMPARISON BETWEEN PRACTICE IN THE USSR AND THE USA IS
INSTRUCTIVE.
COORDINATION OF A NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION NETWORK' A
PLANNING PRIORITY FOR THE BRAZILIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INFORMATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE TECHNOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NATIONAL
INFORMATION NETWORK IN PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND ANALYSES THE
LIMITATIONS OF THE EXISTING INFORMATION STRUCTURES AND SERVICES. THE MAIN
OBJECTIVES OF A NETWORK SYSTEM WOULD BE TO MEET USER INFORMATION NEEDS THROUGH
COOPERATION AMONG EXISTING SERVICES, THUS MAXIMISING THE USE OF AVAILABLE
INFORMATION RESOURCES. THE NETWORK SHOULD ESTABLISH REALISTIC PROGRAMMES BASED
ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTING LIMITATIONS, AND THE NEEDS OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY IN BRAZIL.
A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF PROGRESS AT GOVERNMENT LEVEL SINCE 1980-THE UK
SITUATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE UK PARLIAMENT IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AND THE GROWING INFLUENCES OF PARLIAMENTARIANS, PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL
ISSUES AND THE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL CROSS CURRENTS IN WHICH LIBRARIANSHIP
AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MUST LEARN TO SURVIVE IF NOT PROSPER. BRIEFLY
TOUCHES ON CHANGES IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND LOOKS AT THE US
EXPERIENCE FOR STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND FREE ENTERPRISE.
OUTLINES RECENT MINISTERIAL CHANGES, INCLUDING THE APPOINTMENT OF A MINISTER
OF STATE WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES.
     
A REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BASED ON RECENT
LITERATURE, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE LATIN AMERICAN SITUATION, UNDERTAKEN
BY IBICT, THE BRAZILIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION
IN 1979. AFTER AN INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATION OF BASIC TERMINOLOGY, THE SURVEY
GIVES DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF RECENT NATIONAL PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS, AND OF
EXISTING AND PROJECTED INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE NETWORKS IN EUROPE AND LATIN
AMERICA. THE CONCLUSION COMPARES THE SITUATION IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHERE
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO INVEST STRONGLY IN INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF
INFORMATION SERVICES, WITH THAT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE INFORMATION
RESOURCES ARE PRECARIOUS AND DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY, WHILE GOVERNMENT
POLICY LACKS DETERMINATION IN DEVELOPING REALISTIC PROGRAMMES.
INFORMATION NEEDS, TASK ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION INPUTS TO TASKS.
     
PROPOSES A NEW APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING INFORMATION NEEDS OF RESEARCH AND
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WORKERS, BASED ON TASK ANALYSIS. FROM INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED
IN 1976 AND 1977 WITH 24 UK WORKERS IN THIS FIELD, 2 INFORMATION INPUT
ANALYSES ARE CONSTRUCTED, INDICATING INFORMATION INPUTS IN BASIC RESEARCH AND
IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES. THE DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAN THEN
BE MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY, SINCE THE INPUTS SHOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE
INFORMATION REQUIRED IN RESEARCH.
A SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PUBLIC INFORMATION MATERIALS ABOUT POLYCHLORINATED
BIPHENYLS (PCBS).
     
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PCB-RELATED PUBLICATIONS WAS COMPILED AS A PUBLIC
INFORMATION SERVICE BY THE COMMUNICATIONS STAFF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
SEA GRANT INSTITUTE. MATERIALS ARE GROUPED BY AGENCIES AND ORGANISATIONS AND

DESCRIBED. PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FLOWS OF
PRIMARY SOURCES RECEIVED BY THE 2 ESTABLISHMENTS AND SHOWS BY MEANS OF A
FLOWCHART THEIR COOPERATIVE LITERATURE HANDLING PROCEDURE.
NATIONAL ENERGY INFORMATION SYSTEM BASIC CONCEPTS.
     
THE BASIC CONCEPTS ON WHICH THE NATIONAL ENERGY INFORMATION SYSTEM (NEIS)
RESTS ARE DESCRIBED AND CLARIFIED. THE NEIS WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED UNDER
CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE TO COLLECT, PROCESS, AND DISSEMINATE DATA USEFUL FOR
ANALYSIS OF ENERGY SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION ISSUES.
STATE LEGISLATIVE EXCHANGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION IN THE
REGION (A WORKSHOP ON HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL AND ALCOHOL FUELS IN THE
MIDWEST HELD AT INDIANAPOLIS, IN. ON OCTOBER 1-2, 1979).
     
THE COOPERATION FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE ON HAZARDOUS WASTE ISSUES AND ALCOHOL
FUELS INVOLVES CLEARLY DEFINED DILEMMAS ON THE TECHNICAL PARAMETERS. THE
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS ARE OVER HOW TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS MOST SAFELY, MOST FAIRLY,
AND MOST ECONOMICALLY. FOR ALCOHOL FUELS, THE TECHNICAL POINTS ARE IN DISPUTE.
THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY THE WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS, EXPERTS, AND ENTREPRENEURS
ARE SUMMARISED. AN ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL FOR MIDWEST REGIONAL COOPERATION IS
PRESENTED.

TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM REVIEW.
     
THE TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM IS BEING DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH PROGRAM AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL
LABORATORY. THE GOAL OF TIS IS TO PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO ACCESS, DEVELOP,
AND UTILISE INFORMATION NEEDED IN THE R AND D DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND THE
CONDUCT OF RESULTANT R AND D PROJECTS.
TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIBRARY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
OUTLINES AN APPROACH, WITH BOTH WIDESPREAD IMPLICATIONS AND SPECIFIC PRACTICAL
STEPS, FOR ASSEMBLING SOME OF THE DATA THAT LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS NOW REQUIRE
IN ORDER TO MAKE LIBRARIES OPERATE MORE EFFECTIVELY. THESE DATA HAVE NOT BEEN
ASSEMBLED IN THE PAST BECAUSE THE COSTS IN STAFF TIME ALONE HAVE BEEN AND
CONTINUE TO BE PROHIBITIVE FOR MOST INSTITUTIONS. ONE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO
EFFECTIVE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION IS THE LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM. SOME INVESTIGATORS IN THIS AREA SEEM TO HAVE BECOME
FASCINATED WITH THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF VARIOUS ELUSIVE AND FUGITIVE LIBRARY
STATISTICAL MEASURES, BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE OPERATIONAL
SYSTEMS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ASSEMBLE THESE DATA. THE PROPOSAL OUTLINED
HERE STRESSES THE NEED FOR A TOTAL SYSTEMS APPROACH, BASED UPON STANDARDISED
TERMINOLOGY; MACHINE-AIDED DATA COLLECTION, AND CUSTOMISED COMPUTER PROCESSING
AND REPORTING AS WE LL AS SYSTEMATIC TRAINING AND DOCUMENTATION.
INFORMATION CENTRE'S ROLE IN TRANSFERRING SPECIAL STEELS TECHNOLOGY.
     
DESCRIBES HOW THE INFORMATION CENTRE OF THE SPECIAL STEELS PLANT HELPS THE
ENGINEERS, TECHNOLOGISTS, PLANNERS AND R&D PERSONNEL OF THE PLANT. WITH THE
VIEW THAT TIMELY INFORMATION CAN CHECK WASTAGE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION AND
QUALITY, THE CENTRE ARRANGES TO OBTAIN WHEN NECESSARY, THE RELEVANT
INFORMATION IN ADVANCE DIRECTLY FROM THE SOURCES.
INFORMATION IN THE SERVICE OF CULTURE.
     
THE YAROSLAVSKAYA OBLASTNAYA BIBLIOTEKA IMENI N.A. NEKRASOVA, (N.A. NEKRASOV
YAROSLAV REGIONAL LIBRARY), DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION ON CULTURE AND ART
PROVIDES WORKERS IN THESE FIELDS WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION ON THEIR
SUBJECTS. THE DEPARTMENT SERVES 25 COLLECTIVE AND NUMEROUS INDIVIDUAL
SUBSCRIBERS WITH SELECTIVE INFORMATION ON 200 SUBJECTS. THE DEPARTMENT
EXAMINES ALL BOOKS ACQUIRED ON CULTURE AND ART AND DISPATCHES INFORMATION
CARDS TO SUBSCRIBERS. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO ASSISTS IN ORGANISING
INTER-PROVINCIAL EXCHANGE OF UNPUBLISHED DOCUMENTS CONCERNING WORK EXPERIENCE
IN THESE FIELDS. THE INFORMATION SERVICE TO WORKERS IN CULTURE AND ARTS IN
REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVES SENDING ANNOTATED SUBJECT LISTS ON SUCH
SUBJECTS AS: 'WORK WITH TEENAGERS'. EXPERIENCE SHOWS THE LOCAL CULTURAL
INFORMATION CENTRES ARE NECESSARY.
INFORMATION POLICIES IN WESTERN EUROPE-SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE PRESENT
SITUATION.
     
DISCUSSES NATIONAL INFORMATION POLICIES IN WEST GERMANY, ITALY, SCANDINAVIA,
FRANCE, SPAIN, BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND. VIEWDATA SYSTEMS HAVE
NOT BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THESE POLICIES. STRESSES THAT LITTLE INFORMATION IS
AVAILABLE ABOUT INFORMATION ITSELF. RECOMMENDS THAT THE POWERFUL BUT
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING BODIES SHOULD COOPERATE INTERNATIONALLY.
U.S. INFORMATION POLICY ISSUES.
     
THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN
FORMULATING US INFORMATION POLICIES IS DESCRIBED. THE ISSUES DISCUSSED ARE
GROUPED INTO 4 CATEGORIES. PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE SECTOR QUESTIONS; ECONOMIC
ISSUES; EDUCATION AND TRAINING; INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. FINALLY, A PLEA IS MADE
FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM.
TECHNICAL-COMMUNICATION FUNDAMENTALS IN AN ERA OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.
     
HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS THAT EMPLOY COMPUTERS, CATHODE-RAY
SCREENS, MICROGRAPHICS, AND VIDEO DISCS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE USED TO AN
INCREASING EXTENT. HOWEVER, THE QUALITY OF THEIR MESSAGES AND THE CASE WITH
WHICH THESE CAN BE READ WILL BE CONSIDERABLY LESSENED UNLESS SYSTEM DESIGNERS
APPLY OR ADAPT MORE OF WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT TEXTUAL PRESENTATIONS AND
UNLESS WE OURSELVES PAY BETTER ATTENTION TO HOW WE WRITE.
INFORMATION THEORY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.
     
THE EMPIRICAL IMPORT OF SHANNON'S INFORMATION THEORY AND ITS IMPACT ON
INFORMATION SCIENCE ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS ARGUED THAT EXTENSION OF THE SCOPE OF
INFORMATION THEORY AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF NEW THEORIES OF INFORMATION
SCIENCE PRESUPPOSES BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF RELEVANT EMPIRICAL REGULARITIES
AND LAWS. POSSIBILITIES OF BROADENING THE EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION OF INFORMATION
THEORY BY INTRODUCTION OF APPROPRIATE LEAST EFFORT CRITERIA ARE DISCUSSED.
UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.
     
THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP) AND THE UNIVERSAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL (UBC) PROGRAMMES ORGANISED BY IFLA SHOULD ENABLE
INFORMATION TO BECOME MORE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE. THEY WILL BE HELPED IN THE NEAR
FUTURE BY THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION (UAI) PROGRAMME, THE
OBJECTIVE OF WHICH IS THE REMOVAL OF ALL BARRIERS AND THE UNIFICATION OF
ACTIVITIES FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION IN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE
WORLD.
THE INFORMATION TRANSFER PROCESS.
     
A DETAILED DISCUSSION, BASED ON RECENT LITERATURE, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO
THE SITUATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. COVERS THE PROBLEMS IN GENERAL OF
OBTAINING RELEVANT AND SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTATION, CREATED BY THE
INFORMATION EXPLOSION; THE EXISTING CHANNELS FOR INFORMATION TRANSFER, IN
RELATION TO BOTH AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES AND COMMUNICATION PROCESSES; THE
OBSTACLES INHIBITING EFFICIENT INFORMATION TRANSFER, BOTH GENERAL AND
PARTICULAR, AND SOLUTIONS PROPOSED; THE DIFFICULTIES OF OBTAINING INFORMATION
OF QUALITY, IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE INFORMATION CONSUMERS ARE FREQUENTLY ALSO
PRODUCERS; AND FINALLY THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES IN THE
INFORMATION TRANSFER PROCESS. CONCLUDES BY OUTLINING PROCEDURES FOR ORGANISING
PROGRAMMES TO DEVELOP NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES.
ZZZZ.
     
PHARMACISTS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT, WHICH
CAN ONLY DEVELOP THROUGH USE OF A WELL-EQUIPPED, WELL-STAFFED LIBRARY. ONLY A
FEW HUNGARIAN DISTRICT AND CITY HOSPITALS MEET THESE DEMANDS. THE ONLY
SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR A CENTRE OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY NETWORK OR THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF PHARMACEUTICS TO ORGANISE PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION. SUCH AN
ORGANISATION WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON DEMAND.
VIRTUAL SPACE TELECONFERENCE SYSTEM.
     
A TELECONFERENCE SYSTEM FOR N CONFEREES, N BEING GREATER THAN 2, INCLUDES AT
LEAST 2 SEPARATE STATIONS. EACH STATION HAS N CONFEREE POSITIONS, CONFRONTING
A VIRTUAL CONFERENCE SPACE, AND CORRESPONDING CONFEREE POSITIONS AT EACH
STATION HAVE THE SAME RELATIVE LOCATIONS ABOUT THE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE SPACE.
AT LEAST 1 CONFEREE POSITION AT EACH STATION IS ADAPTED TO BE OCCUPIED BY A
CONFEREE IN PERSON. SURROGATE CONFEREES, WHICH INCLUDE A VIDEO DISPLAY, A
VIDEO CAMERA, AND A LOUDSPEAKER, OCCUPY EACH CONFEREE POSITION NOT ADAPTED TO
BE OCCUPIED BY A CONFEREE IN PERSON.
A FORMAL TREATMENT OF DOCUMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
DEALS WITH A MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF DOCUMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE
MODEL OF DOCUMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS IS GIVEN AS AN INTERPRETATION OF A
FORMAL LANGUAGE. IN THE FORMAL LANGUAGE, A CONCEPT OF THE LABELLED TERMS IS
INTRODUCED AS THE MOST BASIC CONCEPT, FROM A VIEWPOINT OF HIERARCHICAL
SEMANTIC STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENTS. THE LABELS ARE INTENDED TO DENOTE
THE CONTEXT INFORMATION, CALLED THE INFORMATION FUNCTIONS IN THIS PAPER, IN
THE TEXT OF DOCUMENTS.
OPTIMUM ORGANISATION OF THE INFORMATION PROCESS.
     
PRESENTS THE DEMANDS MADE ON INFORMATIAN SERVICES; CITES AN ORGANISATIONAL
SCHEME FOR ANALYTICO-SYNTHETIC INFORMATION PROCESSING; AND IDENTIFIES THE MAIN
TRENDS OF INFORMATION UTILISATION OF RESEARCH INSTITUTES. SHOWS THAT THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SINGLE-TIME INFORMATION SCANNING, ANALYSIS,
AND SELECTION, MULTIPURPOSE UTILISATION, AND DUPLICATION ELIMINATION PROVIDES
FOR A HIGHER DEGREE OF INFORMATION UTILISATION AND CONTRIBUTES TO IMPROVING
THE QUALIFICATION LEVELS OF INFORMATION PERSONNEL.

DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY AND CONTENT OF STATISTICAL AND
RELATED FILES PRODUCED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES.
ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS COMPUTER-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AS PART OF A SYMPOSIUM ON ISSUES IN THE DESIGN AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOCUSES ON THE
ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF THESE SYSTEMS. IT PROVIDES AN UPDATE OF THE
BUCKLEY AMENDMENT OR FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (FERPA)
AND A REMINDER OF RELATED CODES OF ETHICS. 4 SUGGESTED GOALS FOR A STUDENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE SUGGESTED' (1) THAT THE RECORD SYSTEM ONLY CONTAIN
INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THAT IS PERTINENT AND NECESSARY; (2) THAT THE
INFORMATION IT DOES CONTAIN IS CORRECT; (3) THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS WILL
BE KEPT PRIVATE UNLESS ITS RELEASES HAS BEEN AUTHORISED; AND (4) THAT THE
INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED, OTHER STUDENTS, THE SCHOOLS, AND/OR SOCIETY WILL
BENEFIT FROM THE DATA. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
DOD SHOULD GIVE BETTER GUIDANCE AND TRAINING TO CONTRACTORS WHO CLASSIFY
NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION.
     
BECAUSE OF DEFICIENCIES IN GUIDANCE, TRAINING, AND INSPECTIONS, SOME NATIONAL
SECURITY INFORMATION HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED IMPROPERLY, BOTH OVERCLASSIFIED AND
UNDERCLASSIFIED, AND HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY MARKED TO PROTECT IT. GAO EVAULATED
CONTRACTOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLASSIFICATION PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS OF
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12065 AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) BY VISITING 20
CONTRACTORS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BY SENDING ABOUT 600 QUESTIONNAIRES TO
CONTRACTORS NATIONWIDE.
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SERBIA AND AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING.
     
DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND
REFERENCE-INFORMATION WORK AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SERBIA. MAIN FUNCTIONS
OF THE CENTRE ARE' THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION BASED ON THE LIBRARY'S
COLLECTIONS AND THE ROLE OF AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE USER AND RESOURCES OF
THE LIBRARY. DATA PROCESSING IS AUTOMATED AND WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK 3 FILES
ARE MAINTAINED BY THE CENTRE' CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS IN SERBIAN
LIBRARIES; CATALOGUE OF REPORTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN SERBIA; AND THE
CATALOGUE OF SERBIAN RESEARCH AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, INFORMATION SERVICES AND
ARCHIVES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ALL 3 FILES.
INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES-A SPECIALISED INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
COLLABORATION OF THE COMECON COUNTRIES HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO THE FIELD OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. SINCE 1973, A SPECIALISED SECTION
DEALING WITH INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES HAS BEEN IN OPERATION. IN ADDITION TO
CATALOGUES, THE COLLECTIONS INCLUDE PRESPECTUSES, TECHNICAL INFORMATION
LEAFLETS, TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, PRICELISTS, PRODUCTION PROGRAMMES, WORKS
BULLETINS, COMPANY REPORTS AND THE LIKE. THE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT ONLY A SOURCE
OF INVALUABLE INFORMATION ON NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT ARE REFERRED TO, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHENEVER NEW PRODUCTS ARE PLANNED AND DESIGNED. THE SECTION IS HEADED BY THE
STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE USSR, WHERE THE BULLETIN 2NEW
INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES1, CONTAINING 19 SERIES, IS PUBLISHED TWICE A MONTH. ITS
INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES' COLLECTION IS MADE UP OF 100,000 ITEMS. IN BULGARIA,
THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS RESPECT IS WITH THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY. DURING THE YEARS 1976-80 COMPUTERISATION OF THE SYSTEM HAS
BEEN IN PROGRESS, AND A LONGTERM PLAN UP TO 1990 HAS BEEN WORKED OUT.
NATIONAL NEEDS FOR CRITICALLY EVALUATED PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA.
     
RELIABLE VALUES OF NUMERICAL DATA THAT EXPRESS IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS THE
PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY AND ARE NEEDED TO ARRIVE AT VALID DECISIONS WHENEVER A
GOVERNMENTAL OR INDUSTRIAL DECISION INVOLVES ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY. THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE CONTAINS MANY VALUABLE DATA COVERING A
WIDE RANGE OF DIVERSE FIELDS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT ALSO CONTAINS MANY ERRONEOUS
VALUES. A SUBSTANTIAL INTELLECTUAL EFFORT IS A REQUIRED TO SELECT RELIABLE
VALUES FROM THE TOTAL OF THOSE REPORTED. FOR THIS REASON, A NUMBER OF
SPECIALISED DATA CENTRES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO COMPILE AND EVALUATE DATA IN
A SYSTEMATIC FASHION.
SELECTION OF MOLECULAR FRAGMENT FEATURES FOR STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY STUDIES IN
ANTITUMOUR SCREENING.
     
THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM SCREENS ABOUT
13,000 COMPOUNDS PER YEAR FOR ANTITUMOUR ACTIVITY IN A MOUSE PRESCREEN. A
METHOD FOR PREDICTING ACTIVITY USES MOLECULAR FRAGMENT FEATURES OF POTENTIAL
ACQUISITIONS. THIS PAPER COVERS SOME DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE SET OF FEATURES WAS
CHOSEN, FILLING A GAP IN EARLIER PUBLICATIONS.
COMPUTER-AIDED SELECTION OF COMPOUNDS FOR ANTITUMOR SCREENING' VALIDATION OF A
STATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD.
     
RECENT WORK HELPED CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED
STATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD FOR SELECTING COMPOUNDS TO BE PROCESSED IN THE
NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) MOUSE TUMOUR PRESCREEN. ONE STUDY INVOLVED
ABOUT 35,000 COMPOUNDS WHICH SATISFIED CERTAIN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL
CRITERIA. THESE COMPOUNDS, TAKEN FROM THE NCI COLLECTION, WERE RANKED
ACCORDING TO PREDICTED PROBABILITY OF ACTIVITY. THE RESULTS SHOWED 34% OF THE
ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN THE TOP 10% OF THE RANKING. IN A SECOND STUDY THE
PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF A CHEMIST AND THE COMPUTER WERE COMPARED BY HAVING EACH
RATE ALMOST 1,000 PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED COMPOUNDS FOR ACTIVITY. THE RESULTS
WERE ABOUT EQUAL WITH RESPECT TO THE YIELD OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS,
THOUGH THEIR SELECTION AGREEMENT WAS FAIRLY LOW.
CBF-COMPUTER HANDLING OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL FACTS. 2.
     
CBF IS AN EDP-SUPPORTED DOCUMENTATION AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR STRUCTURAL
FORMULAS OF DEFINED ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. IT FITS
THE NEEDS OF A FIRM CONCERNED WITH DRUG RESEARCH FOR PREVAILING UNPUBLISHED
INTERNAL DATA, WHICH THE SCIENTISTS CAN USE FOR REFLECTIONS ON
STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS AND TO SEARCH FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS WITH SPECIAL
ACTIVITY PROFILES.
MAINTENANCE OF THE ORGANIC CHEMICAL PRODUCERS DATA BASE.
     
DESCRIBES THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE ORGANIC CHEMICAL PRODUCERS DATA
BASE FROM MARCH 79 TO DECEMBER 80. DURING THIS PERIOD THE OCPDB, AN AUTOMATED

PROGRAMMES AND TO MEET THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REPORTING, RECORD KEEPING, AND
SURVEILLANCE REQUIREMENTS. SOME OF THE POTENTIAL DATA ELEMENTS THAT NASA WILL
REQUIRE AS INPUT AND OUTPUT FOR THE NEW OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE ILLUSTRATED.
CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE CHILDREN
ACCESS TO INFORMATION, WE MUST' ESTABLISH THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCE-SHARING
ARRANGEMENTS; GRANT CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM; AND INCLUDE
CHILDREN'S MATERIALS AND RESOURCES IN THE DEVELOPING DATA SYSTEMS. CURRENT
STUDIES REVEAL THAT, ALTHOUGH AS CHILDREN REACH JUNIOR HIGH AGE THEY USE THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY PREDOMINANTLY FOR SCHOOL PROJECTS, NEITHER SCHOOL NOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE CHILD'S TOTAL PATTERN OF INFORMATION SEEKING.
LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, TIME, AND SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS BASED ON LIBRARY
RESOURCES CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PATTERN. WHILE MULTIPLE COOPERATIVES SUCH AS
THOSE DEVELOPING IN COLORADO AND BEING INITIATED IN NEW YORK ARE OF INTEREST
AND SHOW PROMISE, LARGE-SCALE FAILURE TO DEVELOP INTER- AND INTRALIBRARY LOAN
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDE CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AS USERS
FURTHER INHIBIT ACCESS BY THE YOUNG. AS OF THIS TIME, LITTLE OF THE MASSIVE
AMOUNT OF CURRICULAR, HISTORICAL, TEXTUAL, OR LITERARY MATERIALS FOR CHILDREN
ARE BEING INCLUDED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED DATA BASES AND SYSTEMS, THUS
DENYING THEIR ACCESS TO ADULTS AS WELL AS TO YOUTH. IN FIGHTING THE BATTLE OF
ACCESS FOR THE YOUNG, LIBRARIANS MUST DEVELOP BROADER COMPETENCIES IN THE
AREAS OF MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY.
LITERATURE STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM USING A TABLE-TOP COMPUTER.
     
A DIALOGUE-PROGRAM IS DESCRIBED WHICH HANDLES CROSS-REFERENCES WITHIN A GIVEN
SET OF KEYWORDS, AUTHOR NAMES, JOURNAL NAMES AND SPECIFIED REFERENCE NUMBERS.

REVIEWED, WITH AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND THEIR
IMPLICATIONS. DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN LIBRARY ORIENTATION, LIBRARY
GUIDING AND SIGN-POSTING AND PRINTED LIBRARY GUIDES ARE CONSIDERED, AND
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE NOTED. EVALUATION OF USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES IS SEEN
AS THE MAJOR PROBLEM FACING ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND SOME EXAMPLES OF ATTEMPTS
AT EVALUATION, INCLUDING THE TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT, ARE GIVEN. A
BRIEF LOOK IS TAKEN AT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND SOME AREAS, SUCH AS STUDY
SKILLS, ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING THOSE WHICH SHOULD NOW BE UNDER CONSIDERATION.

THE ROLE OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN THE TRAINING OF USERS.
     
IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1952 A DECREE WAS PASSED ON THE EXTENSION TRAINING OF
PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS. IT IS THE TASK OF THE BRATISLAVA INSTITUTE OF
EXTENSION TRAINING FOR PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS TO SUPPLY LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION FOR THIS EXTENSION TRAINING. THIS MEANS THE INFORMATION SUPPLY OF
MORE THAN 53 LEARNING GROUPS; ABOUT 2,500 PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS A YEAR.
LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE FOR IN-LIBRARY READING, A LARGE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS
ARE LENT (30,000 UNITS A YEAR). IT IS, HOWEVER, CONSIDERED MORE IMPORTANT TO
TEACH THE PARTICIPANTS OF EXTENSION TRAINING HOW TO USE THE LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION TOOLS THEMSELVES (INCLUDING ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, INDEXES AND
MAGNETIC TAPES).
NO ENGLISH TITLE GIVEN).H
     
UNGARIAN UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IS EXCLUSIVE, WITH OVER-RESTRICTIVE SPECIAL
SUBJECTS. AT SZEGED, AT THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY, ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE
TO TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO LEARN INDIVIDUALLY. PERSONAL CONSULTATIONS WERE
FOLLOWED BY SUBJECT ASSIGNMENTS, GRADED ACCORDING TO STUDENTS' LINGUISTIC
ABILITY. BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, REFERENCE SOURCES AND LIBRARY USE WERE
TAUGHT, AND LITERATURE SEARCHES UNDERTAKEN, FOLLOWED BY ABSTRACTS TRANSLATION.

DOCUMENTS WHICH BEGAN WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 2 BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF OFFICIAL
PUBLICATIONS IN THE 1950S WAS RECENTLY ENHANCED BY THE PUBLICATION OF LISTS OF
OFFICIAL SERIALS. A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT WAS PASSED IN 1978. DOCUMENT
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IS DECENTRALISED, INVOLVING 3 GOVERNMENT PRINTERS
AND SEVERAL AGENCIES. GIVES DETAILS OF THEIR CATALOGUES; PRESENTS THE MAIN
GUIDES AND DIRECTORIES FOR GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT BRANCHES; DISCUSSES THE
MORE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS BEING PUBLISHED; AND REFERS PARTICULARLY TO THE
2JOURNAL OFFICIEL1 AND PUBLICATIONS ON BUDGETING, ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND
STATISTICS.
THE FRENCH COMMISSION FOR COORDINATING ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTATION AND THE
DIRECTORY OF FRENCH OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS.
     
AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF THE PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE
FRENCH COMMISSION FOR COORDINATING ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTATION SINCE ITS
INCEPTION IN 1971, LEADING TO THE RECENT PUBLICATION OF THE 1ST COMPREHENSIVE
DIRECTORY OF FRENCH OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS IN 3 VOLUMES. THE PROBLEMS OF
ESTABLISHING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OVER FRENCH ADMINISTRATIVE PUBLICATIONS
ARE DETAILED, AND THE COMMITTEE'S PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHING AND IMPLEMENTING
A SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH PROGRAMME DESCRIBED IN FULL. THE CONTENTS OF THE
DIRECTORY, AND PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS FOR REGULAR UPDATING, ARE OUTLINED.
ISN'T IT TIME FOR NEW FRONTIERS FOR MANUSCRIPTS TOO?.
     
A SEMINAR 'IL MANOSCRITTO' SITUEZIONE CATALOGRAFICA E PROPOSTA DI UNA
ORGANIZZAZIONE DELLA DOCUMENTAZIONE E DELLA INFORMAZIONI', CENTRAL INSTITUTE
FOR THE UNION CATALOGUE ROME, JUNE 80, CONCLUDED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE VAST
INHERITANCE OF MANUSCRIPTS IN ITALIAN LIBRARIES SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO STUDENTS'
NOTICE BY NEW CATALOGUING METHODS WHICH WOULD TRANSMIT ESSENTIAL DATA TO A
DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION CENTRE. THE NEW METHODOLOGY SHOULD PROVIDE
COLLECTED DATA FOR EACH MANUSCRIPT, A DESCRIPTION AT VARIOUS LEVELS, AND
CENTRALISED ARRANGEMENT OF DATA. ADEQUATE QUALIFIED STAFF WILL BE NEEDED TO
CARRY OUT THE PROJECT. COOPERATION BETWEEN STATE AND REGION COULD PRESENT
PROBLEMS. AN ENERGETIC CULTURAL POLICY AND POLITICAL ENTHUSIASM ARE ESSENTIAL.
LIBRARIANS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A SACRIFICIAL WILLINGNESS TO BREAK DOWN THE
BARRIERS OF INCOMPREHENSION.
LITERATURE REQUIREMENTS OF RESEARCH WORK.
     
INFORMATION ON RESEARCH TOPICS MUST BE UP TO DATE. FOR TOPIC RETRIEVAL, A
RESEARCHER CAN MAKE A PERSONAL CARD INDEX OF JOURNAL ARTICLES, OR CHECK
2CURRENT CONTENTS1. ALTERNATIVELY HE MAY RELY ON 1 OR 2 COMPREHENSIVE WORKS
AND THEIR REFERENCES. HOWEVER, PAPERS IN 2PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEW1 OR
2PHYSIOLOGICAL REVIEW1, FROM ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES, DO NOT REPRESENT A
CROSS-SECTION OF THE IMPORTANT PUBLICATIONS ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC. THE
LITERATURE BASE SHOULD BE ENLARGED.
SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES' THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THE
ROLE OF LIBRARIANS.
     
RESEARCH BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BATH, UK, DURING 1967-75 (INCLUDING THE
INVESTIGATION INTO INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (INFROSS)
AND DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (DISISS) PROJECTS)
SHOWED INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES TO BE
NUMEROUS, UNCOORDINATED, OFTEN POORLY DESIGNED, AND GREATLY UNDERUSED.
OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE THE NON-COMMERCIAL NATURE OF MANY SERVICES,
RELATIVELY SMALL AND POOR MARKET, MAIN BUYERS (LIBRARIES) NOT BEING THE USERS,
AND GENERALLY LITTLE INCENTIVE. IN THE LONG TERM, A TOTALLY AUTOMATED SYSTEM
COULD BE THE SOLUTION. MEANWHILE, LIBRARIES CAN IMPROVE THE SITUATION BY
CONDUCTING EVALUATION STUDIES, CANCELLING POOR SERVICES, PRESSING FOR THE
IMPROVEMENT OF GOOD SERVICES, AND ENCOURAGING USERS TO BE MORE DEMANDING.
THE AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF LITERATURE ABSTRACTS: AN APPROACH BASED ON THE
IDENTIFICATION OF SELF-INDICATING PHRASES.
     
PRESENTS A METHOD FOR THE AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF INDICATIVE ABSTRACTS BASED
ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF COMMONLY-OCCURRING STRUCTURES WHICH EXPLICITLY STATE
THAT THE SENTENCES CONTAINING THEM HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY ABOUT THE
SUBJECT MATTER OR 'MESSAGE' OF THE DOCUMENT. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STRUCTURES OR
'INDICATORS' ARE 'THE PRINCIPAL AIM OF THIS PAPER...' AND 'A METHOD IS
DESCRIBED FOR...'. DISCUSSES THE IDENTIFICATION AND WEIGHTING OF INDICATORS;
ADDITION OF SUPPORTIVE SENTENCES; AND TREATMENT OF EXOPHORIC FEATURES. THE
RESULTS OF A TEST RUN AIMING AT 105-WORD ABSTRACTS WERE PROMISING.
COVERAGE OF WORLD LITERATURE IN ICHTHYOLOGY BY 2BIOLOGIYA1 ABSTRACT JOURNAL
AND 2INTERNATIONAL ABSTRACTS OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES1.
     
COMPARES THE COVERAGE OF WORLD LITERATURE ON ICHTHYOLOGY IN 2 ABSTRACTING
JOURNALS-2BIOLOGIYA1 (USSR) AND 2INTERNATIONAL ABSTRACTS OF BIOLOGICAL
SCIENCES1 (UK)-USING THE CRITERIA TOTAL NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS COVERED;
TIME-LAG; TYPES AND NUMBER OF PRIMARY SOURCES COVERED; SUBJECT DISTRIBUTION OF
PUBLICATIONS COVERED; PUBLICATION SCATTERING; DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS BY
COUNTRY; AND FORMS OF PUBLICATION REDUCTION.
THE ROLE AND PRACTICE OF REFERENCE STATISTICS (IN CHINESE).
     
REFERENCE STATISTICS, AN INTEGRAL PART OF LIBRARY STATISTICS, IS A SIGNIFICANT
ELEMENT IN PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, BUDGET ALLOCATION, AND SHORT TERM AND
LONG-RANGE PLANNING IN A LIBRARY. HIGHLIGHTS SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF
COLLECTING, ANALYSING AND APPLYING REFERENCE STATISTICAL INFORMATION, FROM A
PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW.
USER-LIBRARIAN NEGOTIATIONS AND INFORMATION SEARCH PROCEDURES IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES HYPOTHESES, EXPERIMENTAL SITUATIONS AND DESIGN, ANALYSING
METHODOLOGY, AND FINDINGS AND CONSIDERS THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO THE
USER-LIBRARIAN INFORMATION TRANSFER PROCESS. DESCRIBES A PROJECT ON THIS
TOPIC, UNDERTAKEN DURING 1976-79, CONCURRENTLY WITH THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS
IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AT THE ROYAL SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP, COPENHAGEN,
DENMARK.
PROJECT HERMES.
     
THE PROJECT INVESTIGATES ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS USING A
'SUPER-TELEX' TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY (TELETEX) ALLOWING FULL FACSIMILE
TRANSMISSION, ELECTRONIC MAIL AND THE USE OF VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS.
UAP & PATTERNS OF INTERLENDING.
     
OUTLINES THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP), AND
INDICATES POSSIBLE PATTERNS OF INTERLENDING SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE SUITABLE FOR
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP OF INTERLENDING SYSTEMS TO
BOOK SUPPLY, ACQUISITIONS POLICIES AND PLANS, AND REPOSITORY SYSTEMS.
THE CONCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS PROGRAMME AND ITS
PRACTICAL RESULTS.
     
BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE MOST IMPORTANT PHASES OF THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS (UAP) PROGRAMME. ANALYSES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PROGRAMME
AND INTER-LIBRARY LENDING. OUTLINES THE CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS OF A NATIONAL
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING SYSTEM MODEL AND PRESENTS 4 BASIC MODELS SPECIFYING
THEIR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. FINALLY DESCRIBES SOME PRACTICAL RESULTS
OF THE UAP PROGRAMME IN RELATION TO BRAZIL, BULGARIA, FRANCE, EAST GERMANY,
MALAYSIA, NORWAY, UK AND USA.
UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS IN HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES.
     
HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ORGANISED IN NETWORKS SINCE THE 1950S AND MORE
RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO COORDINATE ACQUISITIONS. THE HIGH COST OF
FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS IS A PROBLEM. GENEROUS LEGAL DEPOSIT LAWS COMPENSATE TO
SOME EXTENT FOR UNION CATALOGUE INADEQUACIES. THE NATIONAL SZECHENYI LIBRARY
DOES NOT LEND MATERIAL, BUT ACTS AS A SWITCHING CENTRE. NEW REGULATIONS WILL
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LIBRARIES LENDING MATERIAL. 23% OF REQUESTS ARE
SATISFIED ABROAD. DEMAND IS AT A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL, BUT SHOWS A STEADY
GROWTH. 2 NEW BODIES, THE CENTRAL STORAGE LIBRARY AND THE CENTRAL REGISTER OF
LIBRARIES, WILL BRING SOME IMPROVEMENTS.
A DALA PROJECT 25 YEARS AGO.
     
DESCRIBES THE 1ST DALA PROJECT CARRIED OUT IN 1956-58 BY THE AUTHOR AND
FINANCED INITIALLY BY LOTTERY MONEY GAINED BY DALARNA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. THE
AIM WAS TO REACH NEW LIBRARY USERS. AFTER A SCANT EXAMINATION OF THE AVAILABLE
LITERATURE THE AUTHOR BEGAN SEEKING POTENTIAL USER GROUPS SUCH AS SOCIETIES
FOR HOUSEWIVES, FARMERS, PENSIONERS, AND SCHOOLS. CONTACTS WERE MADE AND
LETTERS WRITTEN. BOOK EXHIBITIONS AND BOOK TALKS WERE ARRANGED AT MEETINGS OF
THE SOCIETIES. A PROPER EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT WAS NOT MADE, ALTHOUGH SOME
FIGURES ARE AVAILABLE IN UPPSALA UNIVERSITY'S SOCIOLOGICAL SURVEY ON LEISURE
HABITS IN DALARNA PUBLISHED IN 1959. THE AUTHOR LEFT IN 1958, BUT THE PROJECT
WAS CARRIED ON BY OTHERS IN A LIMITED FORM UNTIL 1966, AND A NEW PROJECT IS
DUE TO START IN AUTUMN 81.
TAKE A BOOK': EXHIBITION, MEETINGS AND PUBLICITY ACTIVITIES ON CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE.A
     
N ACCOUNT OF A PROGRAMME OF ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR NOV-DEC 80 IN THE LIBRARIES
OF A NORTH ITALIAN DISTRICT TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN'S USE OF LIBRARIES AND
INVOLVE PARENTS AND TEACHERS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE EXHIBITION, AUTHORS
SCHEDULED TO APPEAR, AND ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR TEACHERS AND CHILDREN OF
DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS.
THE TECHNICAL PROCESSING OF MATERIALS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON THE PHILIPPINES. CLAIMS THAT ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES, MORE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF LIBRARY, HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE
PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS TO COPE WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE
AREA OF TECHNICAL SERVICES. HIGHLIGHTS ADVANCES IN CATALOGUING PRACTICES,
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, COOPERATIVE VENTURES, AND TRAINING PROGRAMMES.
CENTRALISED LIBRARY SERVICES IN MOSCOW.
     
MOSCOW IS DIVIDED INTO 32 AREAS, EACH OF WHICH HAS A CENTRAL MASS LIBRARY AND
BRANCH LIBRARIES. THESE LIBRARIES RECEIVE METHODOLOGICAL ADVICE FROM THE
CENTRAL NEKRASOV LIBRARY. COLLECTIONS OF LITERATURE IN LANGUAGES OF SOVIET
REPUBLICS ARE ALSO STORED IN THAT LIBRARY. THERE ARE 4,000 LIBRARIES IN
MOSCOW, OUT OF WHICH 3,000 ARE MASS LIBRARIES, CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES, SCHOOL
LIBRARIES AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES. THE REST ARE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES. THE
SOVIET CATALOGUING CENTRE RECEIVES 15 FREE COPIES OF ALL THE BOOKS PUBLISHED
IN THE USSR. ALL BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, AND PERIODICALS ARE CATALOGUED THERE,
ABOUT 45,000 BOOKS A YEAR IN ALL. A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IS PRODUCED.
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES ARE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THE CENTRALISED SERVICE.
ISBN IS NOT USED YET, BUT ISSN IS, AND A TRANSLATION PROGRAMME IS BEING
PREPARED FOR INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFER IN MARC FORMAT. CENTRALISED
CATALOGUING SERVICES ARE ALSO OFFERED BY THE LENIN LIBRARY AND BY TH E 4 BOOK
COLLECTIVES IN MOSCOW.
SELF-MADE IS WELL MADE' ON-LINE CATALOGUE ACCESS IN THE NORTHWESTERN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE US NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, WHICH USES
THE UNIVERSITY'S CENTRAL COMPUTER. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE NORTHWESTERN ON-LINE
TOTALLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM, (NOTIS), WAS BEGUN WITH THE LIBRARY'S MOVE TO A NEW
BUILDING IN 1970. THIS WAS AN ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM AND WAS FOLLOWED BY
AUTOMATION OF MOST TECHNICAL ROUTINES. UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS THE LIBRARY USER
INFORMATION SERVICE, (LUIS), A SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS ON-LINE SEARCHING IN THE
LIBRARY'S CATALOGUE OF ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1970. THE CARD CATALOGUE IS,
HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED MEANTIME AS LUIS DOES NOT ALLOW SUBJECT SEARCHES,
NOR HAS FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS. ALTHOUGH COST EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATION
PRIOR TO ITS INTRODUCTION HAD NOT BEEN CONSIDERED THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SMOOTHLY
INSTALLED AND HAD LED TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT.
THERE WAS GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH THE FACT THAT THE LIBRARY HAD BEEN AB LE
TO CREATE A WELL FUNCTIONING, INDEPENDENT SYSTEM.
THE CONFERENCE-GOERS' GUIDE TO COLLECTION BUILDING.
     
DESCRIBES HOW ONE CAN OBTAIN MATERIAL, INFORMATION AND CONTACT TO ASSIST IN
BUILDING COLLECTIONS WHILST ATTENDING CONFERENCES, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE
TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE. A GUIDE TO ALA UNITS
EMPHASISING COLLECTION BUILDING IS APPENDED.
GATHERING ENEMY SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN WARTIME' THE OSS AND THE PERIODICAL
REPUBLICATION PROGRAM.
     
THE EXISTENCE OF AND NECESSITY FOR INTERNATIONAL FLOW OF SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION HAS BECOME A COMMONPLACE. THAT FLOW, HOWEVER, WAS DISRUPTED DURING
WORLD WAR II, WHEN AN EMERGENCY SUPPLY SYSTEM WAS SET UP BY THE USA TO REPLACE
NONFUNCTIONING BOOK TRADE CHANNELS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS' INTERDEPARTMENTAL
COMMITTEE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS (IDC) OPERATED BY THE
OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES (OSS), COLLECTED FOREIGN JOURNALS OVERSEAS IN
ORDER TO REPRODUCE THEM ON MICROFILM AND DISTRIBUTE THEM TO GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, ONE OF WHICH WAS THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. IN LATE 1942 THE OFFICE OF
THE ALIEN PROPERTY CUSTODIAN (APC) WAS URGED TO SEIZE THE COPYRIGHTS OF THE
LEADING EUROPEAN PERIODICALS AND TO REPRINT AND DISTRIBUTE THEM. DESCRIBES
THIS REPUBLICATION PROGRAMME IN DETAIL AND DISCUSSES THE HEIGHTENED NATIONAL
AWARENESS OF THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF CURRENT PUBLISHED INFORMATIO N WHICH
WAS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF AND PLANNING FOR US RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE
POSTWAR DECADES.
THE PROVISION OF LITERATURE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES.
     
IN EAST GERMANY, AN IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND
THE ZENTRALINSTITUT FUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (ZIB-CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP), WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ON PUBLISHED LITERATURE. PRESENT
PROBLEMS INCLUDE OUT OF PRINT MATERIAL AND THE INABILITY OF LOCAL BOOKSELLERS
TO PROVIDE ALL REQUIREMENTS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT ALL LIBRARIES BUY THE POPULAR
MATERIAL RECOMMENDED BY ZIB, ALTHOUGH ONLY LARGE LIBRARIES BUY THE MORE
ADVANCED WORKS, ESPECIALLY ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN
MADE BETWEEN PUBLISHERS AND ZIB CONCERNING THE CENTRALISING OF LIBRARY
SUPPLIES. ZIB'S LISTS OF RECOMMENDED BOOKS, PERIODICALS, NEWSPAPERS, TAPES AND
RECORDS ARE AN IMPORTANT BASIS FOR PURCHASING POLICY; EACH LIBRARY SHOULD HAVE
1 STAFF MEMBER RESPONSIBLE FOR DEALING WITH THEM.
PLANNING ACQUISITIONING OF A JOINT STOCK IN A CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
PLANNED ACQUISITIONING SHOULD BE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE STOCK'S
COMPOSITION AND AN EVALUATION OF ITS BASIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE USSR CULTURE
MINISTRY RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING SUBJECT RATIOS' SOCIOPOLITICAL LITERATURE
19%-20% OF STOCK; NATURAL SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS AND MEDICINE 6%-7%; TECHNOLOGY
AND AGRICULTURE-EACH 6%; ART AND SPORT-6%-7%; FICTION-48%-50%; LINGUISTICS,
LITERATURE, GEOGRAPHY AND GENERAL-8%. LITERATURE OF THE LAST 5 YEARS SHOULD
COMPRISE 50% OF STOCK. CORRESPONDENCE OF THE STOCK'S SUBJECT CONTENT WITH
READERS' REQUIREMENTS IS REVEALED BY COMPARING ITS SUBJECT STRUCTURE WITH THAT
OF THE ISSUE. LANGUAGE COMPOSITION OF STOCK SHOULD ALSO DEPEND ON READER
DEMAND. RESULTS OF STOCK-EVALUATION MUST UNDERLY THE PLANNING OF CURRENT
ACQUISITIONS AND 5-YEAR PLANS.
SELECTION OF HOLDINGS FOR THE BRANCH INFORMATION SYSTEM OF HEALTH.
     
THE BRATISLAVA HEALTH INFORMATION CENTRE DEALS INTENSIVELY WITH INFORMATION
SUPPLY FOR RESEARCH. ONE SIGNIFICANT FIELD OF THEIR WORK IS HEALTH
ORGANISATION, THE INFORMATION BASIS OF WHICH WAS DETERMINED BY SELECTING THE
MOST INFORMATIVE PERIODICALS BY BIBLIOMETRICAL METHODS. THE 2 METHODS APPLIED
WERE' FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, AND CITATION ANALYSIS. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS WAS
CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF 16 SECTIONS OF THE 1977 VOLUME OF 2MEDITSINSKY
REFERATIVNY ZHURNAL 1AND OF SECTIONS 17, 35 AND 36 OF THE 1977 VOLUME OF
2EXCERPTA MEDICA. MRZH 1YIELDED 81 TITLES WITH 711 DATA, +E+M-154 TITLES WITH
711 DATA.
RATIONALISATION AND COOPERATION IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTRALIA.
     
DESCRIBES THE DIFFICULTIES IMPOSED BY BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS ON THE MAINTENANCE
OF ADEQUATE COLLECTIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND THE CONFLICTING AIMS OF
SUPPLYING DIFFERENT CLIENTELE. QUESTIONS THE ABILITY OF EXISTING COLLECTION
RESOURCES IN AUSTRALIA TO RESPOND TO INCREASING AND COMPETING DEMANDS.
DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH THE DUAL AIMS OF RATIONALISATION THROUGH RESOURCE
SHARING AND THE PROTECTION OF COLLECTION INTEGRITY MIGHT BE ACHIEVED, TAKING
INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED FOR PLANNING IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT.
QUO VADIMUS?.
     
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICIES IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED FROM THE
POINT OF VIEW OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE TEACHING
FACULTIES.
A SIMPLE OBJECTIVE METHOD FOR DETERMINING A DYNAMIC JOURNAL COLLECTION.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 79TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, HONOLULU, HAWAII, 5 JUNE 79. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CONTENT OF
A JOURNAL COLLECTION, QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF THE USE OF A 647-TITLE
COLLECTION HAVE BEEN RELATED TO SPACE AND COST REQUIREMENTS TO DEVELOP
OBJECTIVE CRITERIA FOR A DYNAMIC COLLECTION FOR THE TREADWELL LIBRARY AT THE
MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL. THE METHOD IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
POPULAR FICTION SELECTION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES: IMPLICATIONS OF POPULAR CULTURE
STUDIES.
     
PROPOSES THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIANS, IN SELECTING POPULAR FICTION, ABOLISH THE
CONFLICT BETWEEN HIGH VALUES AND 'LOW' TASTES BY FORMULATING SELECTION PLANS
IN WHICH VALUE IS INSTRUMENTAL-CONDITIONAL UPON THE DEGREE TO WHICH A WORK OF
FICTION MEETS OR FAILS TO MEET IDENTIFIED NEEDS. IN THIS WAY THEY WILL COME TO
UNDERSTAND THE WAYS IN WHICH EXISTING WORKS SERVE THE READING PUBLIC'S NEEDS,
AND SERVE THE PUBLIC BETTER.
A REVIEWER'S STORY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. A REVIEWER LOOKS AT SELECTION,
DESCRIPTION, AND CRITICISM OF THE CHILDREN'S BOOKS WHICH SHE MUST DECIDE TO
RECOMMEND OR NOT RECOMMEND FOR LIBRARY PURCHASE. WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE
DISCUSSION IS A PERSONALISED ACCOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT FORCE THE REVIEWER TO
CONSIDER THE WHOLE RANGE OF POSSIBLE REACTIONS TO CONTROVERSIAL MATERIAL FROM
VIEWPOINTS OF CHILDREN, PARENTS, LIBRARIANS, EDUCATORS, PUBLISHERS, AUTHORS,
AND ARTISTS. IN ADDITION TO THE NATURE OF THE BOOK AND THE PROSPECTIVE READER
THE REVIEWER NEEDS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HER OWN PREPARATION AND EXPERIENCE FOR
EVALUATING AND REVIEWING EACH BOOK.
SERIAL ACQUISITION AS A CAPITAL BUDGETING PROBLEM.
     
EXAMINES THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PURCHASING PERIODICALS ON A 1-YEAR VERSUS A
3-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. THE DECISION PROBLEM IS VIEWED AS A CAPITAL
BUDGETING PROBLEM WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS COST MINIMISATION OVER A 6-YEAR TIME
SPAN. THE VARIABLES CONSIDERED CRITICAL TO THE DECISION INCLUDE COST OF
CAPITAL, SUBSCRIPTION REORDER COST FACING THE LIBRARY, ANNUAL RATE OF CHANGE
OF SUBSCRIPTION RATES, AND RATIO OF 3-YEAR TO 1-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION COSTS. THE
MODEL WAS DEVELOPED AND APPLIED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LIBRARY MANAGERS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER. RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT, EVEN UNDER THOSE
CONDITIONS MOST FAVOURABLE TO MAINTAINING A 1-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION POLICY,
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS CAN ACCRUE BY SHIFTING TO A 3-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION POLICY.
AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL ALLOCATION FORMULA FOR THE MAXIMIZATION OF USE OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS.
     
DEVELOPS A MATHEMATICAL FORMALISATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF MAXIMISING USE OF
LIBRARY MATERIALS IN TERMS OF THE IDEAS DEVELOPED BY T.J. PIERCE AND W.E.
MCGRATH (78/2422) IN THEIR WORK OF ALLOCATION, AND SOLVES THIS PROBLEM TO
PRODUCE THE ALLOCATION FORMULA THAT MAXIMISES THE USE OF MATERIALS. BRIEFLY
DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING THE FORMULA.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.
     
REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON THE USE OF BATCH AND ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA
BASES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS
OF A SURVEY OF US SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND MEDIUM SIZED RESEARCH LIBRARIES
DESIGNED TO ASCERTAIN THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES IN SELECTION
AND COLLECTION EVALUATION. CONCLUDES THAT ON-LINE DATA BASES ARE BEING
PRIMARILY USED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION AS PART OF THE SELECTION
PROCESS, AND THAT VERY LITTLE USE IN COLLECTION EVALUATION WAS REPORTED,
ALTHOUGH ITS POTENTIAL WAS ACKNOWLEDGED. DESCRIBES A RECENT EVALUATION OF
CHEMISTRY HOLDINGS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT
ALBANY.
THE ISRAEL LEGAL DEPOSIT LAW (IN HEBREW).
     
IN 1953 THE LAW, ORIGINALLY PROMULGATED BY THE BRITISH MANDATORY GOVERNMENT,
WAS AMENDED. AS IT NOW STANDS, PUBLISHERS MUST DEPOSIT 5 COPIES OF EACH NEW
BOOK WITHIN 1 MONTH, AS FOLLOWS' 1 TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE, 1
IN THE ISRAEL STATE ARCHIVES, 1 IN THE KNESSET LIBRARY AND 2 IN THE JEWISH
NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (JNUL). THE PRESENT LAW DOES NOT COVER
NON-BOOK MATERIAL; EDITIONS ARE NOT STRICTLY DEFINED; THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE
DELINQUENCY IN DEPOSIT OF BOOKS DURING THE STATUTORY PERIOD OF 1 MONTH; THE
FINES ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO DETER PUBLISHERS; AND THE PROCEDURES FOR
INSTIGATING LEGAL ACTION ARE IN THEMSELVES A DETERRENT AGAINST SUCH ACTION.
OUTLINES THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE JNUL TO ENCOURAGE PUBLISHERS TO COMPLY WITH
THE LAW, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT AS MANY BOOKS AS POSSIBLE ARE DEPOSITED UNTIL
THE LAW CAN BE AMENDED.
THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL MEETING OF EXPERTS FROM NATIONAL LIBRARIES OF SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES ON ACQUISITIONS AND INTERNATIONAL BOOK EXCHANGE (BUDAPEST, 2-6
OCTOBER 1979).
     
THE MAIN TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE 3RD MEETING WERE' THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
OF PUBLICATIONS AND THE DESIGN OF A MODEL OF THE COPYRIGHT LAW. ALTHOUGH A
SYSTEM OF DUPLICATES EXCHANGE HAS NOW BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE EXCHANGE OF
MICROFILMS HAS INCREASED, 1 AREA OF EXCHANGES NOT YET FUNCTIONING SMOOTHLY IS
OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS. A MORE UNIFIED APPROACH WILL HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED
BEFORE THE SYSTEM CAN BECOME FULLY EFFECTIVE. THE WORKING GROUP SET UP TO
INVESTIGATE THE POSITION OF THE COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT PRESENTED THEIR
RECOMMENDATION TO PRODUCE A MODEL OF THE COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT LAW FOR SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES AS THE MODEL PRODUCED BY THE IFLA'S SECTION ON NATIONAL LIBRARIES
DOES NOT SUIT THE CONDITIONS OF MULTINATIONAL AND FEDERAL COUNTRIES AND
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES IN GENERAL.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING AROUND THE WORLD' A REVIEW OF RECENT PAPERS' XII.
     
SUMMARISES 11 STUDIES OF INTERLENDING EFFICIENCY AT REGIONAL LEVEL OR IN
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN CANADA, DENMARK, EAST GERMANY, WEST GERMANY, HUNGARY,
AND THE USA.

LOANS AND REQUESTS WITHIN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES, INTERSTATE AND OVERSEAS.
DEMONSTRATES THE COMPLEXITIES OF REAL COSTING OF ALTERNATIVES AND SUGGESTS
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSPORT IN THE MEDIUM TERM.
COPYING AND COPYRIGHT.
     
DISCUSSES WHY COPYRIGHT HAS BECOME A MATTER OF CONTROVERSY AND BRIEFLY REVIEWS
THE CURRENT SITUATION IN CANADA, THE UK, AUSTRALIA AND THE USA WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO INTERLIBRARY LOANS. GIVES DETAILED ATTENTION TO LEGISLATION
PASSING THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTERLENDING.
     
BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON
TELECOMMUNICATIONS OVER THE NEXT 2 DECADES, AND LIBRARIANS SHOULD NOW BE
DECIDING THE KIND OF COMMUNICATION FACILITIES THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE
DEVELOPED. DESCRIBES FACILITIES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN AUSTRALIA AND
EMPHASISES THE PACKET SWITCHING SERVICE BEING PLANNED, USING INTERLENDING TO
DEMONSTRATE ASPECTS RELEVANT TO LIBRARIANS.
OVERVIEW WITH NATIONAL COMPARISONS.
     
LOOKS AT THE GENERAL TRENDS IN INTERLENDING AND THE ABILITY OF EXISTING
SYSTEMS TO SUPPLY DOCUMENTS. COMPARES THE AUSTRALIAN PATTERN WITH THOSE OF
OTHER COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE UK AND USA. CONSIDERS CENTRALISED VERSUS
DECENTRALISED SYSTEMS.
AN ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING IN AUSTRALIA.
     
EXAMINES THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE CURRENT PATTERN OF INTERLENDING
IN AUSTRALIA, EMPHASISING UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AS SUPPLIERS AND USERS OF
INFORMATION. ADVOCATES THE CONCEPT OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA AS A
LENDING LIBRARY OF 1ST RESORT.
WHERE AND HOW TO GET IT? THE PROPOSED ILL EVALUATIVE STUDY.
     
DESCRIBES THE OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY OF THE PROPOSED EVALUATIVE SURVEY OF
INTERLENDING IN AUSTRALIA. OUTLINES THE NEED FOR SUCH A SURVEY WITH AN
EXPLANATION OF THE KIND OF DATA TO BE COLLECTED AND THE PRINCIPLE SURVEY
INSTRUMENTS TO BE USED. THE SURVEY IS INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE TYPE OF
INTERLENDING ORGANISATIONAL PATTERN BEST SUITED TO THE AUSTRALIAN
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT.
INTERLENDING IN THE 80'S' PROCEEDINGS OF A NATIONAL CONFERENCE HELD AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND, BRISBANE. 27TH-29TH AUGUST, 1980.
     
PROCEEDINGS OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA QUEENSLAND BRANCH AND
COLLEGE LIBRARIES SECTION, UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND, BRISBANE, 27-29 AUG 80.
ITS AIM WAS TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF BOTH POLICY-MAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS ON
THE ROLE OF INTERLENDING IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICES DURING THE
NEXT FEW YEARS. THE PROGRAMME WAS DIRECTED 1ST AT THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH
REGARD TO PATTERNS OF INTERLENDING IN AUSTRALIA, AND 2ND, TO WAYS IN WHICH
FUTURE SERVICES MIGHT BE IMPROVED. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL PAPERS SEE
THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'-.
A NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY FOR AUSTRALIA.
     
PRESENTS A MODEL FOR THE FUTURE SUPPLY OF INTERLOANS IN AUSTRALIA. PROPOSES A
NATIONAL LOAN/PHOTOCOPY COLLECTION AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA
(N.L.A.) FOR CURRENT JOURNALS, SUPPORTED BY A HIGHLY SELECTIVE UNION LIST.
ACCESS TO LOCATIONS FOR DEAD TITLES AND LAST RUNS WOULD BE THROUGH A LESS
VOLATILE UNION CATALOGUE COVERING 60-70 LIBRARIES. REPORTS WOULD BE SUPPLIED
FROM A SINGLE CENTRE FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. LIKEWISE, CENTRAL PROVISION FOR
BOOKS WOULD BE MADE BY THE N.L.A., SUPPORTED BY A UNION CATALOGUE COVERING
THOSE LIBRARIES WITH SIGNIFICANT UNIQUE HOLDINGS AND INTAKE.
A SURVEY OF INTER-LIBRARY LOAN PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS AT ELEVEN INDIAN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
INTER-LIBRARY LOAN IS ONE OF THE COMMON METHODS OF RESOURCE SHARING WHERE
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF LIBRARIES CAN PARTICIPATE. DESCRIBES THE INTER-LIBRARY
LOAN PROGRAMMES AND OPERATIONS OF 11 INDIAN UNIVERSITIES.
THE VIEWPOINT OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN.
     
2 AUSTRALIAN SPECIAL LIBRARIANS GIVE THEIR VIEWS ON INTERLIBRARY LOANS. MOYA
MCKENZIE LOOKS AT THE IMPACT OF COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, UNION
CATALOGUES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DELIVERY SYSTEMS, INTERLOAN 2VERSUS1 PURCHASE,
CONCLUDING THAT THE DEMAND FOR INTERLOANS WILL CONTINUE, BECOMING A GREATER
BURDEN ON LARGE LIBRARIES WITH FINE CORE COLLECTIONS, AND THAT SOME LIBRARIES
WITH GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES MAY OPT FOR OBTAINING MATERIAL DIRECT FROM
THE EMANATING BODY AS BEING MORE RELIABLE AND CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN. MYVANWY
EMERY DESCRIBES THE FORMAL, INFORMAL AND 'BACKDOOR' APPROACHES TO INTERLOANS
BETWEEN SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND THE PROBLEMS OF AVAILABILITY OF MATERIAL AND
PASSING THE REAL COSTS ON TO THE CONSUMER.
COST RECOVERY' THE CASE FOR.
     
THERE IS WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION THAT THE COSTS OF INTERLENDING ARE UNEQUALLY
DISTRIBUTED, AND SOME NORTH AMERICAN LIBRARIES ARE ALREADY ATTEMPTING FULL OR
PARTIAL COST RECOVERY. PUTS THE CASE FOR RECOUPING OF INTERLOAN COSTS. LOOKS
AT POTENTIAL REVENUE SOURCES, COST RECOVERY, COST ACCOUNTING AND THE IMPACT OF
TECHNOLOGY.
COST RECOVERY' THE CASE AGAINST.
     
ARGUES AGAINST THE CONCEPT OF COST RECOVERY FOR INTERLOANS ON THE GROUNDS THAT
THIS WOULD IMPEDE THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN THE COMMUNITY, AND THAT THE
DISABILITIES OF THE LARGE NET LENDING LIBRARIES SHOULD BE EASED IN OTHER WAYS
SUCH AS SPECIAL SUBSIDY, A WIDER SPREAD OF DEMAND OVER A GREATER NUMBER OF
LIBRARIES AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS DEVELOP, IMPROVED TRAINING OF INTERLOAN
OFFICERS AND POSSIBLY BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LENDING
LIBRARY OF 1ST RESORT.
BOOKS AT AUCTION' THE ART OF DEACCESSIONING.
     
THE COST OF MAINTAINING A LIBRARY COLLECTION IS HIGH. WHILE LIBRARIANS WELCOME
BEQUESTS, THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT COSTLY CONDITIONS SUCH AS KEEPING THE BEQUEST
INTACT OR NOT SELLING IT. LIBRARIES ARE INCREASINGLY USING OUTSIDE SUBJECT
EXPERTS TO WEED THEIR COLLECTIONS. FOR REASONS OF PROPRIETY, MOST DISCARDED
BOOKS ARE SOLD AT AUCTIONS. LIBRARIES ALSO SEND VALUABLE BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS
TO AUCTIONS TO OBTAIN FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. OFFERS ADVICE CONCERNING
THE DECISION TO WEED A COLLECTION, EXPLAINS THE PROCEDURE FOR CONTACTING A
BOOK AUCTION HOUSE, AND GIVES HINTS ON THE CONDITION OF THE BOOKS.
CONSERVATION: AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME?.
     
CONSERVATION IN THE SENSE OF PHYSICAL PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS IS
DISCUSSED VERY BRIEFLY.
A NATIONAL PRESERVATION PROGRAM. PROCEEDINGS OF THE PLANNING CONFERENCE.
     
ASSISTED BY A GRANT FROM THE COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES, THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS PRESERVATION OFFICE CALLED THE CONFERENCE TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE THE
MOST PRESSING NEEDS OF THE PRESERVATION COMMUNITY TO REVIEW RECENT TECHNICAL
DEVELOPMENTS AND CALL FOR A MORE COORDINATED AND CONCERTED EFFORT IN THE
FUTURE.
THE TREATMENT OF DOCUMENTS AND THE LAW IN CANADA.
     
DISCUSSES' THE GENERAL LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS ON WHICH ALL LEGISLATION IS BUILT,
AND WHICH NECESSARILY ARE RELEVANT TO THE INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS
SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH ARCHIVES' BASIC LEGAL TERMS ARE CLARIFIED WITH
EXAMPLES OF USAGE; ATTITUDES OF SPECIALISTS TO THE VARIOUS LAWS WHICH COULD
AFFECT CONSERVATION OF DOCUMENTS' HOW THE LAW MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
IN PLANNING, THE NECESSITY FOR LEGAL ADVICE, AND LEGAL STIPULATIONS RELATING
TO CONSERVATION; LAWS RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO ARCHIVES IN QUEBEC AND CANADA;
AND LAWS BEARING ON CONSERVATION. THE RELEVANT FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL
LEGISLATION IS LISTED.
CONSERVATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS.
     
A REVISED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE 1ST PUBLISHED IN 1977 DISUCSSING TECHNICAL
PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE CONSERVATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS. DESCRIBES THE
CHEMICAL PROCESSES INVOLVED IN CREATING AND FIXING PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND
TECHNIQUES FOR CONTROLLING THE EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL RESIDUES. REFERENCE IS MADE
TO THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE (ANSI) SPECIFICATIONS FOR ARCHIVE
FILM, AND STORAGE, IN RELATION TO THE CREATION OF NEW PERMANENT COLLECTIONS,

THE SECURITY VIEWPOINT.
RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF A COMPUTERIZED CIRCULATION SYSTEM ON THE PERFORMANCE
OF A LARGE COLLEGE LIBRARY. PART ONE' THE MAIN LIBRARY.
     
OBERLIN COLLEGE HAS BEEN STUDYING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE VARIABLES WHICH WERE
EXPECTED TO CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF AN AUTOMATED CIRCULATION
SYSTEM. 2 YEARS OF DATA COLLECTION HAVE SHOWN THAT QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN
SERVICE HAVE OCCURRED. SPECIFICALLY' (1) BOOK AVAILABILITY HAS INCREASED. (2)
ACCESSIBILITY HAS INCREASED (PATRONS ARE SPENDING LESS TIME SEARCHING FOR
BOOKS). (3) BUILDING USE CHANGED IN THAT TOTAL USE OF THE BUILDING DROPPED BUT
HOURS SPENT USING LIBRARY MATERIALS INCREASED. (4) PATRON ATTITUDES RESPONDED
TO THE DEGREE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM.

BEYOND DAY 1' THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOG. PAPERS PRESENTED AT A CATALOGING
COMMITTEE PROGRAM, JUNE 7, 1978.
     
THESE PAPERS PRESENTED AT A PROGRAM BY THE BOSTON LIBRARY CONSORTIUM COMMITTEE
HAVE 3 OBJECTIVES' TO PRESENT BASIC NON-TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON THE
IMPLICATION FOR MEMBER LIBRARIES OF THE DECISION BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TO
CLOSE ITS CATALOGUE AND TO ADOPT AACR2; TO EMPHASISE THE NEED TO MAKE
DECISIONS IN THE NEXT 2 YEARS ON CARD CATALOGUE ALTERNATIVES; AND TO PROVIDE
ALL CONSORTIUM STAFF WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND OPTIONS AS
THEY RELATE TO SERIALS, READER SERVICES, OR OTHER AREAS OF A LIBRARY SYSTEM.

LIBRARY DEVELOPMENTS AND CATALOGUING EXPERIENCES IN THE PHILIPPINES.
     
A GROUP OF 4 ARTICLES, FOR ABSTRACTS OF WHICH +S+E+E THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'.
CATALOGUING AND LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT' SOME ISSUES OF CONCERN TO A FILIPINO
LIBRARIAN.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON THE PHILIPPINES. SUGGESTS THAT 1 ASPECT
OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED AND NEGLECTED IN THE
PHILIPPINES-THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT ORGANISATION OF MATERIAL RESOURCES.
NARROWING THIS WIDE TOPIC DOWN TO THE ORGANISATION OF FILIPINIANA RESOURCES IN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, DISCUSSES SENSITIVE AREAS, VARIED INTERPRETATIONS AND
INCONSISTENCIES IN CATALOGUING AND CALLS ON FILIPINIANA CATALOGUERS TO
INITIATE WORK ON CATALOGUING GUIDELINES AND STANDARDISATION.
ALTERNATIVES FOR LIBRARY CATALOGUES' TOOLS FOR CATALOGUE PLANNING.
     
MANY LIBRARIES ARE EXAMINING THE CURRENT STATE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND THE
IMPACT OF VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR THEIR FUTURE. PRESENTS 2 TOOLS WHICH MAY BE
USEFUL IN SUCH STUDIES' (1) A CHECKLIST OF THE WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT
SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN LOOKING AT THE CATALOGUE AS A SYSTEM AND AS
THE RESULT OF A COMPLEX SET OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES AND (2) A TABLE SETTING OUT
SOME POSSIBLE OPTIONS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE FACE OF THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF AACR2 AND SOME CRITERIA AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE THESE
OPTIONS.
FUTURE CATALOGS AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC LINKS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
THE DECISION BY MANY LIBRARIES TO ADOPT AACR2, FREEZE THEIR CATALOGUES, AND
INITIATE NEW CATALOGUES, RAISES SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING LINKS BETWEEN THE
OLD AND NEW CATALOGUES. WITH REFERENCE TO THE SITUATION AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY
(CALIFORNIA) LIBRARIES, EXAMINES THE INTENDED GOAL OF CATALOGUES, HOW THE
EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN 1 CATALOGUE AFFECTS SUCH GOALS, AND ALTERNATIVE METHODS
OF LINKING CATALOGUES FOR NAMES, SUBJECTS, AND TITLES. PRESENTS
RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE OPTIMAL LINKING METHOD AND INVESTIGATES CHANGES
IN ORGANISATION, STAFFING, AND COSTS.
CATALOGUING IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF THE PHILIPPINES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON THE PHILIPPINES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
THE PHILIPPINES IS BOTH A NATIONAL LIBRARY AND A PUBLIC LIBRARY. ALL
ACQUISITIONS ARE CATALOGUED CENTRALLY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS INCLUDING THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES AND DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION, 18TH EDITION (EXPANDED VERSIONS OF SECTIONS PERTAINING TO THE
PHILIPPINES). PRODUCTION OF THE 2PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY1 IS BEING
COMPUTERISED. THERE IS A SHARED CATALOGUING PROGRAMME WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF
THE PHILIPPINES AT LOS BAN&0OS. CATALOGUING-IN-PUBLICATION IS BEING
INTRODUCED.
CATALOGUING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL SECTION ON THE PHILIPPINES. THE UNIVERSITY OF THE
PHILIPPINES LIBRARY SYSTEM IS A NETWORK OF 34 LIBRARIES. ITS CATALOGUING
SECTION IS PART OF THE CENTRALISED TECHNICAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT AT THE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE SECTION PRODUCES 90,000 CATALOGUE CARDS FOR 17,000
TITLES ANNUALLY. OUTLINES RULES FOLLOWED FOR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING, SUBJECT
CATALOGUING, AND CLASSIFICATION AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE SECTION'S
PUBLICATION, 2FILIPINIANA UNION CATALOG. 1REPORTS ON THE SECTION'S PROJECT TO
IDENTIFY AND COMPILE A LIST OF PHILIPPINE PERSONAL AND CORPORATE NAME
HEADINGS.
STATUS REPORT ON THE MAP CATALOGING PROJECT AT THE ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY.
     
ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY BEGAN ITS MAP CATALOGUING PROJECT ON 1 AUG 80. ALL
FORMERLY UNCATALOGUED SHEET MAPS ARE BEING CATALOGUED IN MARC MAP FORMAT AND
THOSE ALREADY CATALOGUED BY VARIOUS METHODS ARE BEING RECATALOGUED, USING
OCLC. BECAUSE THE STATE LIBRARY IS A REGIONAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE
DEPOSITORY, THE FEDERAL MAPS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE SUDOC
(SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS) SYSTEM. ALL OTHER MAPS ARE BEING CLASSIFIED BY
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS G SYSTEM. DESCRIBES PROGRESS ON THE PROJECT AND
DISCUSSES PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THEIR SOLUTION.
ON-LINE CATALOGUES, ON-LINE CATALOGUING.
     
DESCRIBES THE FORMS OF CATALOGUE PRODUCED AUTOMATICALLY FROM BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA BANKS (CARDS, COM, PRINTED, ON-LINE) AND ANALYSES THE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF EACH. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ON-LINE TECHNOLOGY IS STRESSED FOR
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND INPUT OF CATALOGUING DATA. STRESSES THE ADVANTAGES
OF AN ON-LINE SYSTEM, USING OCLC AND BLAISE AS EXAMPLES.
AACR2' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION AND DATABASE CONVERSION.
     
OCLC'S ONLINE UNION CATALOG (OLUC) CONTAINS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS CREATED
UNDER VARIOUS CATALOGUING GUIDELINES. UNTIL DEC 80, NO SYSTEM-WIDE ATTEMPT HAD
BEEN MADE TO RESOLVE RECORD CONFLICTS CAUSED BY USE OF THE DIFFERENT
GUIDELINES. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW GUIDELINES, AACR2, EXACERBATED THESE
RECORD CONFLICTS. TO REDUCE LIBRARY COSTS, WHICH MIGHT INCREASE DRAMATICALLY
AS USERS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THOSE CONFLICTS, OCLC CONVERTED NAME HEADINGS
AND UNIFORM TITLES IN ITS DATA BASE TO AACR2 FORM.
OCLC'S DATABASE CONVERSION' A USER'S PERSPECTIVE.
     
DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE OF A LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WITH HEADINGS IN THE OCLC
DATA BASE THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO AACR2 FORM. IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE USE OF
LC AUTHORITY RECORDS IN THE DATA BASE. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED,
INCLUDING SOME RESULTING FROM LC PRACTICES. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRESENCE OF THE
AUTHORITY RECORDS, AND ESPECIALLY THE CONVERSION OF ABOUT 40% OF THE HEADINGS
IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, HAS BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE LIBRARY,
SIGNIFICANTLY SPEEDING UP THE CATALOGUING OPERATION.
OCLC-AN AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ITS WAY TO DENMARK.
     
LIBRARY AUTOMATION BEGAN IN 1965 WITH THE FIRST MARC PILOT PROJECT INITIATED
BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND SOON TAKEN UP BY THE BRITISH NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO SECURE WORLDWIDE
USE OF THE SYSTEM, CULMINATING IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE UNIVERSAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, EXCHANGE OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA
HAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS, SO THAT INTERNATIONAL USE OF MACHINE READABLE
INFORMATION IS NOT VERY WIDESPREAD. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL, ENGLISH LANGUAGE
BASED STANDARDS AND EXCHANGE OF ACTUAL TAPE HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS IN
SCANDINAVIA. FOR THESE REASONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICE CENTRES, 'UTILITIES',
HAVE BEEN SET UP IN USA AND ENGLAND, AN IDEA WHICH IS ALSO BEHIND THE DANISH
SYSTEMS SAMKAT AND BIBLIOTEKSDATA. THE LARGEST IS THE US OCLC, WHICH BEGAN IN
1967. ITS MAIN TASK IS DEVELOPMENT OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE AND
DECENTRALISED CATALOGUING, WHICH SUPPLIES THE BASE WITH 60, 000 TITLES
ANNUALLY FROM 4,000 TERMINALS. IT ALSO OPERATES AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM, AND
HOPES TO ADD ACCESSIONS AND ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO THE SERVICES. THE MAIN
PRODUCT IS CATALOGUE CARDS. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'OCLC EUROPE', DANISH
LIBRARIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND FOR OR AGAINST COOPERATION WITH IT.
OCLC ANNUAL MEETING SAN FRANCISCO JUNE 30.
     
PRESENTS HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 1ST ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY CENTER ANNUAL MEETING,
30 JUNE 81, SAN FRANCISCO. MIRIAM DRAKE, CHAIRMAN OF THE OCLC BOARD OF
TRUSTEES, DESCRIBED THE BOARD'S ROLE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF OCLC; OCLC PRESIDENT
ROWLAND C.W. BROWN FOCUSED ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OCLC IS OPERATING, THE
BASIC FINANCIAL PICTURE OF THE CORPORATION, MAJOR STRATEGIES AND GOALS FOR THE
1980S, AND NETWORK RELATIONS; JOSEPH BOYKIN TRACED A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE OCLC
USERS COUNCIL, WHICH WAS BROUGHT INTO BEING IN 1977 WHEN THE OHIO COLLEGE
LIBRARY CENTER BECAME OCLC AND EXPANDED ITS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE; AND SCOTT
BRUNTJEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE NETWORK DIRECTORS GROUP, COMMENTED ON THE VALUE AND
ROLE OF LIBRARY NETWORKS.
OCLC SERVICES.
     
THE RUNNING OF ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC) WAS DESCRIBED BY THE
PRESIDENT, WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE CENTRE'S FUTURE SERVICES
AND SUBSYSTEMS.
COMPARING THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANS.
     
THE US SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION NETWORKING COMMITTEE DEVELOPED AND
ADMINISTERED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 4 MAJOR NORTH AMERICAN
UTILITIES' OCLC, RESEARCH LIBRARIES INFORMATION NETWORK (RLIN), UNIVERSITY OF
TORONTO LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS (UTLAS) AND WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK
(WLN). THE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE GENERAL BACKGROUND FOR SPECIAL
LIBRARIANS WHO ARE EVALUATING OR SELECTING A BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITY. THE SURVEY
COVERED' MEMBERSHIP, GOVERNANCE, OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY, TERMINALS, STARTUP
COSTS AND SERVICE FEES, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE.
THAWING STAFF ATTITUDES ABOUT A 'FROZEN' CATALOG.
     
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION DECISION TO
CLOSE THE CARD CATALOGUE IN FAVOUR OF A MICROFICHE CATALOGUE ON 1 JAN 81 CAME
IN LATE NOV 80 AFTER SEVERAL CHANGES OF MIND AND CAUSED CONFUSION AMONGST BOTH
PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF CLOSURE. DESCRIBES THE WORK OF 1 OF THE 3 TASK
FORCES APPOINTED TO CREATE ORDER-THE CATALOGUE INSTRUCTION GROUP. IT WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING PROGRAMMES DEALING WITH PUBLIC RELATIONS, USER
INFORMATION, AND STAFF ORIENTATION. BY FOLLOWING SET PRINCIPLES OF
ORGANISATION, COMMUNICATION, AND DECISION-MAKING, THE GROUP MANAGED TO REVERSE
NEGATIVE STAFF ATTITUDES AND REACHED LARGE NUMBERS OF LIBRARY USERS.
CATALOGUES ON FILM.
     
DESCRIBES CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1974 THE LIBRARY
JOINED THE OCLC NETWORK AND TODAY ALL TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS ARE AUTOMATED. THE
USERS MEET AUTOMATION THROUGH THE COM CATALOGUE (COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFILM), A
SYSTEM REGARDED AS MUCH CHEAPER THAN AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THERE WERE MANY
TEETHING TROUBLES INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL USE OF THE CATALOGUE, PARTICULARLY
IN THE BRANCH LIBRARIES, AND THE AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEM LED TO A VERY
TIGHT BUDGET CONTROL OVER THE BRANCHES. ALTHOUGH NEW EDITIONS OF THE COM
CATALOGUE TAKE LONGER TO ARRIVE THAN PROMISED IT HAS LED TO IMPROVED
INTERLENDING SERVICE. THE PUBLIC, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO USE THE OLD
DISCONTINUED CARD CATALOGUE AS, IT WAS CLAIMED, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE
LIBRARY SERVICE'S TOTAL HOLDINGS, BUT ONLY IN THE STOCK OF THE LIBRARY BRANCH
USED. THE STAFF, TOO, DESPITE LACK OF ORGANISED OPPOSITION, EXPRESSED
CRITICISM OF THE AUTOMATION PROGRAMME.
IMPLEMENTATION OF AACR2 AND ITS EFFECTS ON RESEARCH LIBRARY CATALOGS (IN
HEBREW).
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A WORKSHOP ON AACR2. DISCUSSES THE PROS AND CONS OF
ADOPTING THE NEW RULES AND EXAMINES ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION.
THESE METHODS INCLUDE' CLOSING CARD CATALOGUES AND STARTING AUTOMATED BOOK,
MICROFILM OR ON-LINE CATALOGUES; LINKING OLD AND NEW FORMS OF HEADING IN THE
CARD CATALOGUE; AND SELECTIVE REVISION OF OLDER HEADINGS. THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS
OF CATALOGUES SEPARATED BY ALPHABET ARE TREATED, AND SOME OF THE NEW LIBRARY
OF CONGRESS PRACTICES BASED ON OPTIONS IN AACR2 WHICH AFFECT JUDAICA/HEBRAICA
CATALOGUING ARE NOTED. THE USE OF AUTHORITY FILES TO CONTROL VARIANT FORMS OF
HEADING IS STRESSED, AND FUTURE TRENDS IN AUTOMATED CATALOGUING ARE
CONSIDERED.
THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S APPROACH TO AACR2.
     
THE FORMAL COMMITMENT OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY TO AACR2 AND DEWEY 19 ENTAILED
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE UK MARC FORMAT, THE BLAISE FILING RULES, AND A
VARIETY OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY ITSELF AND FOR OTHER
LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE BRITISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE BRITISH LIBRARY
FILE CONVERSION INVOLVED NOT ONLY HEADINGS BUT ALSO ALGORITHMIC CONVERSION OF
THE DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING.
URGENT MEASURES FOR IMPROVING LOCATION REFERENCES OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES BY
WAY OF THE PERIODICAL DATA BANK.
     
THE NATIONAL REFERENCE SYSTEM FOR PERIODICALS AND SERIALS IS THE PERIODICAL
DATA BANK AT THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE AND THE STATE LIBRARY OF PRUSSIAN
CULTURAL HERITAGE IN BERLIN. THE DATA BANK CONTAINS TITLE DATA ON 180,000
GERMAN AND FOREIGN PERIODICAL ARTICLES WITH 500,000 LOCATION REFERENCES. TO
IMPROVE THE SUPPLY OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES OVER THE SHORT TERM THE FOLLOWING
MEASURES ARE NECESSARY' THE ACCELERATION OF CATALOGUING OF ALL PERIODICAL
COLLECTIONS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL LITERATURE
SUPPLY SYSTEM; THE DATA COLLECTIONS OF OTHER PERIODICAL REFERENCE SYSTEMS
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA BANK; TITLE DATA IN THE PERIODICAL DATA BANK
SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH THAT SUPPLIED BY SUBJECT INFORMATION SERVICES WITH A
VIEW TO ACQUIRING MISSING TITLES; THE DATA BANK SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN AN
ON-LINE INFORMATION BANK. AN EFFICIENT ON-LINE SYSTEM WOULD EVENT UALLY LEAD
TO USERS BEING ABLE TO ORDER PERIODICALS DIRECTLY AND BEING REFERRED TO THE
NEAREST RELEVANT LIBRARY.
PROBABILISTIC MODELS OF INDEXING AND SEARCHING.
     
DESCRIBES THE AUTHORS' WORK TO BRING TOGETHER THE 2 STRANDS OF RESEARCH ON
INDEXING AND SEARCHING AND THEIR PROGRESS TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
OF A MODEL (WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROBABILISTIC THEORY OF DOCUMENT
RETRIEVAL) WHICH MAKES OPTIMUM USE OF WITHIN-DOCUMENT FREQUENCIES IN
SEARCHING.
UNIFIED RULES ON KEYWORD CATALOGUING.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE VEREIN DER BIBLIOTHEKARE AN
OFFENTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES) WEST
GERMANY, MAY 81. LIBRARIANS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE IDEA OF UNIFIED KEYWORD
CATALOGUING RULES FOR OVER 50 YEARS AND THE SUBJECT CATALOGUING COMMITTEE OF
THE DEUTSCHES BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE) HAS RECENTLY
PRODUCED A REPORT ON THIS SUBJECT. SINCE SUBJECT CATALOGUING PROBLEMS HAVE
BEEN NEGLECTED FOR DECADES AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING CARRIED OUT BY MANY
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES HAS RESULTED IN THE WASTING OF WORK TIME, SUPER-REGIONAL
COOPERATION IN THIS SPHERE OFFERS ATTRACTIVE PROSPECTS. IF REGIONAL UNION
CATALOGUE SYSTEMS AND CENTRALISED SERVICES TOOK OVER ALL SUBJECT CATALOGUING,
RATIONAL RULES AND PROCEDURES WOULD RESULT. KEYWORD CATALOGUES ARE BECOMING
MORE AND MORE POPULAR AND THE CREATION OF UNIFIED RULES WILL DEMAND MORE
INTENSIVE WORK BY LIBRARIANS.
TOWARDS ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN INDEXING LANGUAGES.
     
OUTLINES PREVIOUS WORK DONE IN THE FIELD OF COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN INDEXING
LANGUAGES (IL), AND DESCRIBES THE SCOPE, LIMITATIONS AND ADVANTAGES OF
ESTABLISHING COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN IL. SUGGESTS METHODS FOR VERBAL COMPARISONS
BETWEEN IL AS WELL AS GENERATION OF AN ALPHABETICAL COMPARISON MATRIX MI.
CONCEPTUAL COMPARISONS HOWEVER, DEMAND A CONCEPTUAL REORGANISATION OF MI INTO
A COMPATIBILITY MATRIX M2 WITH ITS TWO ALTERNATIVES, NAMELY A SYSTEM-RELATED
MATRIX M3 AND A HIERARCHICAL MATRIX M4. DESCRIBES THE USE OF A COMPATIBILITY
MATRIX, AND DISCUSSES SOME ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS.
ANALYSIS OF KEYWORDS IN CHEMISTRY.
     
FROM THE 10 MILLION KEYWORDS IN 3 VOLUMES OF 2CA CONDENSATES 1FOR 1977 AND
1978, 16,000 KEYWORDS WERE ASSEMBLED FROM THE 200 MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING
ONES IN EACH OF THE 80 SECTIONS AND ANALYSED FOR CROSS-CORRELATION,
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES, AND RELATIONSHIP TO 10,000 TERMS IN A SEPARATE
JAPANESE CHEMICAL SOCIETY LIST.
MEASUREMENT-THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE MZ-METRIC.
     
DEVELOPS A MECHANISM FOR DESCRIBING AND INVESTIGATING THE RELATION BETWEEN (1)
FORMAL MEASURES FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND (2)
INTUITIVE IDEAS, OR VIEWPOINTS, ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE SYSTEMS. APPLIES
ELEMENTARY VIEWPOINTS (FORMALISED VIEWPOINTS ON SYSTEM OUTPUT QUALITY) TO THE
MZ-METRIC (A PERFORMANCE MEASURE), DISCUSSING THE MEASUREMENT-THEORETIC
PROBLEMS ATTACHED TO THE MZ-METRIC AND THE APPLICATIONS OF THE ELEMENTARY
VIEWPOINTS MECHANISM.
A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SIMILARITY MEASURES, DOCUMENT TERM WEIGHTING
SCHEMES AND REPRESENTATIONS IN A BOOLEAN ENVIRONMENT.
     
REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF A STUDY WHICH AIMED TO EVALUATE RANKING ALGORITHMS
SO THAT GENERALISATIONS ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS COULD BE MADE. A SINGLE DATA
BASE, COMMON USER POPULATION, AND COMMON SETS OF QUERIES AND RELEVANCE
JUDGEMENTS WERE USED. ALSO REPORTS ON SOME UNEXPECTED FINDINGS RELATING TO THE
PERFORMANCE OF DOCUMENT REPRESENTATIONS AND SEARCHER DIFFERENCES.
INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES' A CLASSIFIER'S PROBLEM.
     
THE GROWTH OF INTERDISCIPLINARY SUBJECTS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,
ENERGY, COMPUTERS AND WOMEN'S STUDIES HAVE PRESENTED A GREAT CHALLENGE TO
ESTABLISHED CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES. EXAMINES THE CASE FOR ONE PLACE
CLASSIFICATION AND EVALUATES THE BROWN CLASSIFICATION IN THE LIGHT OF THIS
PRINCIPLE.
COMMON SUBDIVISIONS IN DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION. CRITICAL COMMENTS OF
EDITION 19.
     
PRESENTS AND CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE MAIN CHANGES AND ADDITIONS WHICH HAVE
BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE 7 AUXILIARY TABLES OF EDITION 19 OF DDC. DISCUSSES
THE INTRODUCTION AND USE OF THE TABLE OF PRECEDENCE. SUGGESTS THAT THERE
SHOULD BE MORE INTENSIVE STUDY OF EDITION 19 TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE.
THE BASIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND UDC AND RULES FOR ITS REVISION AND PUBLICATION.
     
DISCUSSES BASIC THEORY OF UDC; STRUCTURE AND NOTATION IN THE MAIN AND
COMPLEMENTARY TABLES; MANAGEMENT BY THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF
DOCUMENTATION'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE ON CLASSIFICATION AND THE UDC SECRETARIAT;
GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR REVISION AND DEVELOPMENT; PROCEDURES FOR THE WORKING
OUT AND PRESENTATION OF SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION; THE TREATMENT OF SUGGESTIONS
FOR REVISION BEFORE PUBLICATION; PUBLICATION OF SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION AND
PUBLISHERS' CORRECTIONS; THE UDC MASTER VERSION AND MASTER FILE, EXTENSIONS
AND CORRECTIONS TO UDC, CUMULATED UDC SUPPLEMENTS; AUTHORISED EDITIONS OF UDC
AND OTHER UDC PUBLICATIONS; COPYRIGHT AND LICENCE FEES; AND THE UDC REVISION
COMMITTEES.
THE USE OF UDC IN THE CATALOGUES OF MEDICAL LIBRARIES.
     
UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION (UDC) IS CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO ITS USE IN
MEDICAL LIBRARIES. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS SCHEME AND ITS POSSIBILITIES IN
IMPROVING THE USE OF MEDICAL LIBRARY STOCKS ARE EMPHASISED.
PATENT CLASSIFICATION AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED TO THE SOCIETY OF INDEXERS, 20 JAN 81. SURVEYS THE PATENT
INFORMATION SERVICES FOR PUBLIC AND INDUSTRY PROVIDED BY THE UK PATENT OFFICE
AND THE SCIENCE REFERENCE LIBRARY. EXAMINES BRIEFLY THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF
THE PATENT OFFICE'S SERVICES' DOCUMENT PUBLICATIONS; THE DOMESTIC
CLASSIFICATION KEY USED FOR CLASSIFYING OFFICIAL SEARCH FILES; INDEXES
MAINTAINED; THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN THE KEEPING OF CLASSIFICATION RECORDS AND
THE FILE LIST SERVICES PROVIDED; AND THE WORK OF THE CLASSIFICATION SECTION.
SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION OF FICTION IN THE HOLON MUNICIPAL LIBRARY (IN HEBREW).
     
FORMER ATTEMPTS TO CLASSIFY FICTION CONCENTRATED ON LITERARY GENRES AND ONE
SUCH ATTEMPT IN THE ROSKILD, (DENMARK) LIBRARY IS BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE HOLON
LIBRARIANS DECIDED TO BUILD A SUBJECT CATALOGUE FOR FICTION WHICH CAN BE
READILY USED BY READERS AS WELL AS LIBRARIANS. A BASIC LIST OF SUBJECTS WAS
DRAWN UP AND ADDITIONAL ONES ADDED AS WORKS OF FICTION WERE PROCESSED. IT WAS
FOUND THAT SOME FICTION CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED BY SUBJECT, WHILE OTHER WORKS
RECEIVE 2 OR MORE SUBJECT CARDS. THE CLASSIFICATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN 2
STAGES; AT FIRST ONLY BOOKS CURRENTLY RECEIVED WERE CLASSIFIED, AND LATER THE
EXISTING FICTION COLLECTION WAS PROCESSED IN THE SAME FASHION. THE LISTS OF
SUBJECT HEADINGS IN HEBREW AND ENGLISH ARE APPENDED.
A FACETED CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR MYTHOLOGY AND RELATED SUBJECTS.
     
(MA THESIS.) FACETED SCHEME FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF MYTHOLOGY AND SUPPORTIVE
RELATED SUBJECTS.
SYSTEMATIC INDEXING OF THE 2UNION CATALOGUE OF AUSTRIAN THESES1.
     
THE 2UNION CATALOGUE OF AUSTRIAN THESES1 APPEARS ANNUALLY AND LISTS ALL
APPROVED THESES FROM AUSTRIAN UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS. SINCE ITS
INCEPTION IN 1966 UNTIL 1975 THE SUBJECT INDEX WAS CONSTRUCTED FROM KEYWORDS
IN THE TITLES, BUT AS FROM 1976 A SPECIALLY DESIGNED SYSTEMATIC SUBJECT
CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN IN USE. IT IS TO SOME EXTENT BASED UPON THAT IN USE AT
VIENNA'S UNIVERSITY AND POLYTECHNIC, AND THE NEW METHOD OF SELECTING AND
STANDARDISING SUBJECT HEADINGS IS DESCRIBED. THERE ARE ALSO INDEXES OF
PERSONAL NAMES (AS SUBJECTS OF THESES, NOT AUTHORS), AND PLACE NAMES. INDEXING
IS DONE MANUALLY, COMPUTERISED INDEXING BEING TOO EXPENSIVE. CUMULATIONS WILL
BE MADE, THE 1ST FOR THE PERIOD 1976-86.
RESEARCH REPORT ON SUBJECT HEADING PATTERNS IN OCLC MONOGRAPHIC RECORDS.
     
REPORT OF AN INVESTIGATION ALSO DESCRIBED IN LIBR. RESOUR. TECH. SERV. 25 (1)
JAN/MAR 81 (SEE 82/1403).
USER REACTIONS TO PRECIS IN THE BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX.
     
REACTIONS OF USERS TO PRECIS (PRESERVED CONTEXT INDEX SYSTEM) SUBJECT INDEXING
IN BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX WERE STUDIED BY STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AS PART OF A
WIDER SURVEY OF PRECIS USER REACTION IN THE UK. FINDINGS ARE PRESENTED IN
TERMS OF EASE OF USE, EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL OF CITATIONS, WHETHER TOO MUCH
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN ENTRIES, THE STRUCTURE OF INDEX ENTRIES AND THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERMS, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A '1-STAGE' INDEX.
CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT IN A SPECIALISED FIELD LIKE EDUCATION A SOPHISTICATED
INDEXING TECHNIQUE CANNOT OBVIATE THE INDEXER'S SPECIALISED SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE,
BUT THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PRECIS ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK, AND ENTRIES
SHOULD NOT BE FURTHER SIMPLIFIED. A MAJORITY CONSIDERED PRECIS BETTER THAN THE
PUBLICATION'S PREVIOUS INDEXING METHOD.
OBSERVATIONS ON STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES CONCERNING THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION.
     
ATTEMPTS TO COMPARE THE EXISTING STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR THESAURUS
CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT, FOCUSSING PARTICULARLY ON THE ISO, BSI STANDARDS
AS WELL AS ON THE GUIDELINES SUGGESTED BY AITCHISON AND GILCHRIST, AND
UNISIST. CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS' LINGUISTIC ASPECTS OF THESAURI;
FORMAL REQUIREMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE STANDARDS/GUIDELINES WITH SPECIAL
EMPHASIS ON PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPOUND TERMS, HOMOGRAPHS, FORMS OF
TERMS, ETC.; SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TERMS-SYNONYMY, BT/NT, AND
ASSOCIATIVITY; PROBLEMS PECULIAR TO MULTILINGUAL THESAURI, ESPECIALLY THE
PROBLEM OF INEXACT EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN TERMS; AND PRESENTATION AND ARRANGEMENT
OF TERMS IN A THESAURUS.
SEMI-AUTOMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF THESAURI USING FREE-LANGUAGE VOCABULARY
ANALYSES. PART 1.
     
VARIOUS TECHNIQUES WERE STUDIED FOR THE COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND MANIPULATION OF
THE FREE-LANGUAGE INDEXING ASSIGNED TO DOCUMENTS IN A DATA BASE TO FORM THE
BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRUCTURED VOCABULARY SYSTEM OR THESAURUS BASED
ON FREE-LANGUAGE INDEXING. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATIC TRUNCATION
PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED AND THE RESULTS OF STATISTICAL STUDIES ON THE GROWTH
AND FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FREE-LANGUAGE VOCABULARY ARE PRESENTED.
INTEGRATION OF THESAURI IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONTA CONFERENCE, BIELEFELD, 24-27 MAY 81. DISCUSSES
THE OBJECTIVES AND COMPILATION OF THE PROPOSED INTEGRATED THESAURUS OF THE
SOCIAL SCIENCES, WHICH IS INTENDED TO ACT AS A MASTER REFERENCE TOOL, AS AN
AID IN SEARCHING ACROSS DATA BASES, OR A SWITCHING MECHANISM. THE 1ST STEP IN
COMPILATION SHOULD BE THE MERGING OF TERMS TO FORM A DESCRIPTOR BANK. TO
COMPARE THE MERGED TERMS AT THE CONCEPT LEVEL, ANALYSIS IN SUB-FIELDS IS
PROPOSED WITHIN A CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK, PREFERABLY 1 WITH A FACETED
STRUCTURE, SUCH AS THE 2ND EDITION OF THE 2BLISS BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION.
1THE CLASSIFICATION WOULD SERVE AS THE MASTER AGAINST WHICH THE TERMS FROM THE
MERGED INFORMATION LANGUAGES, ARRANGED IN A COMPATIBILITY MATRIX, WOULD BE
COMPARED. THE MASTER CLASSIFICATION WOULD BE MODIFIED DURING INTERACTION WITH
THE MATRIX TERMS, AND EMERGE AS THE INTEGRATED THESAURUS IN A FORMAT SIMILAR
TO THAT OF THE BSI ROOT THESAURUS, HAVING A D ETAILED CLASSIFIED DISPLAY AND
FULL ALPHABETICAL SECTION. PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE WORKED OUT IN THE SUB-FIELD OF
UNEMPLOYMENT USING TERMS FROM 5 THESAURI AND THE UDC. ALSO CONSIDERS
MULTILINGUAL IMPLICATIONS, TESTING AND UPDATING.
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL RESEARCH.

ACTIVE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AS A HUMAN COLLEAGUE CAN HELP THE USER; DESCRIBES
THE NECESSARY SYSTEM FACULTIES; DISCUSSES ISSUES IN MODELLING SUCH FACULTIES
ON A COMPUTER; AND PRESENTS THE ANATOMY OF AN ACTIVE SYSTEM AS ENVISAGED AT
THE PRESENT RESEARCH STAGE.
REPRESENTATION OF KNOWLEDGE IN A LEGAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
THE LEGAL RESEARCH SYSTEM IS A KNOWLEDGE-BASED COMPUTER RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR
USE BY LAWYERS AND LEGAL ASSISTANTS AND CONTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT 200 COURT
DECISIONS AND 200 STATUTES CONCERNING US NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS LAW (CHEQUES
AND PROMISSORY NOTES). 4 KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LEGAL CONCEPTS AND RELATED
COURT CASES ARE REPRESENTED-FUNCTIONAL, STRUCTURAL, SEMANTIC, AND FACTUAL.
DISCUSSES THE MOTIVATION FOR INCLUDING EACH KIND OF KNOWLEDGE. DESCRIBES THEIR
COMPUTER REPRESENTATION AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF THEIR USE. DESCRIBES HOW THE
SYSTEM'S STRUCTURE IS USED TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET USER QUERIES.
A BACKEND MACHINE ARCHITECTURE FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
DESCRIBES PROGRESS TO DATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BACKEND MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
FOR LARGE TEXTUAL DATA BASES OR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. OUTLINES THE
USE OF HIGH-SPEED PATTERN MATCHING, STRING PROCESSING, AND OTHER NON-NUMERIC
OPERATIONS FOR THE BASIC SEARCH MODULE. THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE ALSO USED A
STRUCTURED APPROACH AND FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION OF THE PARTS OF THE BACKEND
MACHINE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HIGH-LEVEL QUERY LANGUAGE, WHICH COMBINES A
LIMITED AMOUNT OF INVERSION WITH SERIAL HIGH-SPEED TEXT PROCESSING IN A
PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED FASHION.
THE FACT DATABASE: A SYSTEM BASED ON INFERENTIAL METHODS.
     
THE FACT DATA BASE (A MODEL FOR A NEW TYPE OF INFORMATION-HANDLING SYSTEM) IS
DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF ITS MAIN DATA STRUCTURE (BUILT FROM UNITS OF INFORMATION
CALLED 'FACTS') AND ITS CONCEPTUAL SECTION WHICH MANIPULATES THE STRUCTURE
(THE FACT MACHINE). ITS NOVELTY ARISES FROM ITS INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE-A
MODEL OF THE REAL WORLD DESCRIBED BY THE DATA BASE AND REPRESENTATION OF
INFORMATION FED TO THE MACHINE. THIS, AUGMENTED BY INFORMATION ABOUT SET
MEMBERSHIP, ENABLES THE SYSTEM TO USE INFERENTIAL METHODS IN MANY ASPECTS OF
ITS OPERATION. SHOWS HOW THESE FEATURES LEAD TO A SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE INTERFACE,
BOTH TO OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND TO 'USER FRIENDLY' QUERY LANGUAGES.
A TERM WEIGHTING MODEL BASED ON UTILITY THEORY.
     
3 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TERM-WEIGHTING MODELS (INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY,
TERM DISCRIMINATION VALUE, AND TERM PRECISION) ARE DESCRIBED AND RELATED TO
ONE ANOTHER USING UTILITY THEORY AS AN EVALUATION MODEL. DEMONSTRATES THAT ALL
3 LEAD TO THE SAME CONCLUSION' WHEN TERM INDEPENDENCE AND BINARY INDEXING
(NON-WEIGHTED) ARE INITIALLY ASSUMED, THE MOST IMPORTANT TERMS EXHIBIT MEDIUM
FREQUENCY AND THE WORST ONES ARE THE HIGH FREQUENCY TERMS.
MULTILEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEM-TOWARDS MORE FLEXIBLE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SYSTEMS.
     
THE MULTILEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (MLIS), AN EXTENSION OF A TYPICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM TOWARDS MORE COMPLETE DATA PROCESSING, IS
DISCUSSED. MLIS INTEGRATES FUNCTIONS TYPICAL FOR DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AND RETRIEVAL-ORIENTED SYSTEMS. SEVERAL LEVELS OF DATA ACCESSING ARE PROVIDED,
EACH LEVEL DEVELOPED FOR A DIFFERENT CLASS OF USERS.
AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE USING FRAGMENTS FOR RUN-TIME INDEXING AND
COMPRESSION.
     
AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE (AFS) IS OFFERED AS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT
PROBLEMS WITH ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. IT WOULD BE A
SINGLE-INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE, DEDICATED TO ASSOCIATIVE FILE
SEARCHING WHILE OVERALL CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO A
CONVENTIONAL SINGLE-INSTRUCTION SINGLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE. THE ASSOCIATIVE
PARALLEL PROCESSOR (A MAJOR COMPONENT OF AFS) WOULD SUPPORT 'ON-THE-FLY' FILE
SEARCHING AND SIMPLIFY THE INDEXING PROBLEMS OF DIRECTLY ACCESSING SINGLE
RECORDS TO THAT OF INDICATING THE MOST PROBABLE SCAN BLOCK FOR A HIGH RECALL
OF MATCHING RECORDS. INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS SUGGEST THAT AFS WOULD OUT-PERFORM
CONVENTIONAL FILE STORES BY OVER 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BE SIMPLE TO MAINTAIN,
AND OFFER FULL FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL FLEXIBILITY.
PROBLEMS IN THE SIMULATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
PRESENTS A FORMAL PROBABILISTIC LOGICAL MODEL OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE USED AS A BASIS FOR THE COMPUTER SIMULATION OF INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL FROM A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. DESCRIBES A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE MODEL AND ASSESS HOW WELL THE IMPLEMENTATION WAS ABLE TO SIMULATE THE
CRANFIELD II AND MEDLARS RETRIEVAL TEST COLLECTIONS AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY'S
COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.
A MODEL OF A DOCUMENT-CLUSTERING-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WITH A
BOOLEAN SEARCH REQUEST FORMULATION.
     
PRESENTS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD WHICH CLUSTERS DOCUMENTS ON THE BASIS
OF PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED CLUSTERS OF BOOLEAN SEARCH REQUEST FORMULATIONS.
SUGGESTS WAYS OF SELECTING THESE FORMULATIONS AND DISCUSSES THE INFLUENCE OF
SELECTION METHOD ON RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE
METHOD WHICH PROVIDES RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS COMPARABLE TO THAT OBTAINED WITH
A SEQUENTIAL FILE. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE ILLUSTRATED BY A NUMERICAL
EXAMPLE.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HARDWARE VERSUS SOFTWARE TEXT SEACH.
     
PRESENTS A HYBRID APPROACH TO DATA BASE TEXT SEARCHING, USING THE BEST
FEATURES OF INVERSION AND STREAMING SEARCHING TECHNIQUES TO MINIMISE DATA FLOW
AND OBTAIN COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITY. THE QUERY IS BROKEN INTO 2 PARTS
BASED UPON THE EXISTENCE OF TERMS (OFFENSIVE TERMS) HAVING LEADING OR IMBEDDED
'DON'T CARES'. THOSE DOCUMENTS SATISFYING THE PART OF THE QUERY WITHOUT
OFFENSIVE TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED VIA INVERSION. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE ACCESSED AND
THE OFFENSIVE TERMS ARE SEARCHED FOR VIA STREAMING. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF
THE 1ST SET OF SIMULATION RUNS IN WHICH THE EXPERIMENTERS PERFORMED
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON MACHINE PROCESSING POWER AND % OF TERMS WITH LEADING
VARIABLE-LENGTH 'DON'T CARES'.
ON THE INCLUSIVENESS OF SYSTEMS FOR RETRIEVAL DOCUMENTS INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED
DESCRIPTORS.
     
ONE MEANS OF REDUCING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TIME IS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WHEN ONE KNOWS THE
SYSTEM RESPONSE TO A QUERY WHICH IS MORE GENERAL IN RELATION TO ANOTHER QUERY,
THEN IN AN INCLUSIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO RETRIEVE THE RESPONSE TO THE
MORE SPECIFIC QUERY IT SUFFICES TO LIMIT THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROCESS TO
THE SEARCH OF THE SYSTEM RESPONSE TO THE MORE GENERAL QUERY. DEMONSTRATES THE
PROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WHERE DOCUMENTS ARE
INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED DESCRIPTORS, AND IN WHICH QUERY SEARCH PATTERNS ARE
BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS OF DESCRIPTORS (SYSTEMS USING THE INVERTED FILE METHOD, THE
CANONICAL STRUCTURE FILE-METHOD, OR THE SEQUENTIAL FILE METHOD). THE PAPER
PRESENTS 3 METHODS FOR A DETERMINING A PARTIAL ORDERING RELATION ON A SET OF
BOOLEAN SEARCH PATTERNS OF QUERIES, IMPLYING A PARTIAL ORDERI NG ON THE SET OF
THE SYSTEM RESPONSES TO THESE QUERIES AND DISCUSSES THE ADEQUACY OF EACH
METHOD DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD USED.
CONCEPTUAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
OUTLINES RECENT RESEARCH IN NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING CARRIED OUT AS PART OF
THE YALE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT; DISCUSSES THE 4 KEY ISSUES TO BE
ADDRESSED IN DESIGNING A SYSTEM ABLE TO ORGANISE AND RETRIEVE FACTS IN
RELATIVELY UNCONSTRAINED DOMAINS (ORGANISING MEMORY, ANALYSING INPUT TEXT,
AUTOMATICALLY UPDATING MEMORY, AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS); AND DESCRIBES THE
PROJECT'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, CYFR. CYFR COMPRISES 2 SYSTEMS. FRUMP (FAST READING
UNDERSTANDING AND MEMORY PROGRAM) READS STORIES FROM THE UNITED PRESS
INTERNATIONAL NEWS WIRE AND OUTPUTS A CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE
IMPORTANT EVENTS OF EACH STORY IT UNDERSTANDS. CONCEPTUAL SUMMARIES CONCERNING
THE US SECRETARY OF STATE ARE SENT TO CYRUS, WHICH FILLS IN CONTEXTUAL
DETAILS, ADDS NEW INFORMATION TO ITS DATA BASE, AND CAN THEN BE INTERROGATED
ABOUT THE NEW INFORMATION.
USE OF A MAXIMAL COMMON SUBGRAPH ALGORITHM IN THE AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF
THE OSTENSIBLE BOND CHANGES OCCURRING IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS.
     
A FAST PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE LARGEST SUBSTRUCTURE
COMMON TO THE REACTANT AND PRODUCT MOLECULES IN A CHEMICAL REACTION. ONCE THIS
SUBSTRUCTURE HAS BEEN FOUND, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY AUTOMATICALLY THOSE
BONDS IN THE REACTING MOLECULES WHICH HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN BROKEN OR FORMED IN
THE COURSE OF THE REACTION; THESE BOND CHANGES COULD BE USED AS INDEXING TERMS
FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF CHEMICAL REACTION INFORMATION.
COMMENTS ON A 'METHOD FOR GENERATING A CHEMICAL REACTION INDEX FOR STORAGE AND
RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION'.
     
A RECENTLY PROPOSED METHOD FOR GENERATING NUMERIC IDENTIFIERS FOR CHEMICAL
REACTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE METHOD DEPENDS UPON THE EXACT
FORM IN WHICH THE REACTION IS DESCRIBED AND ALSO THE METHOD RESULTS IN THE
SAME IDENTIFIER BEING ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT REACTION TYPES.
COMPUTER-ASSISTED MECHANISTIC EVALUATION OF ORGANIC REACTIONS. 2. PERCEPTION
OF RINGS, AROMATICITY, AND TAUTOMERS.
     
NEW ALGORITHMS FOR THE PERCEPTION OF RINGS, AROMATICITY, AND TAUTOMERS WERE
DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAMEO PROGRAM FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTED
MECHANISTIC EVALUATION OF ORGANIC REACTIONS. A NOTEWORTHY ASPECT OF THE RING
ALGORITHM IS THAT ONLY RINGS BELONGING TO THE SMALLEST SET OF SMALLEST RINGS
ARE FOUND. RESULTS FOR REPRESENTATIVE MOLECULES ARE PRESENTED, AND RULES FOR
DETERMINING THE AROMATICITY/TAUTOMER STATUS OF RINGS, ESPECIALLY HETEROCYCLES,
ARE DISCUSSED.
EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS ON A COMPUTER INTERFACE TO AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
NETWORK.
     
A PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DEVELOP AN INTERFACE THAT WOULD PROVIDE
DIRECT ACCESS FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS TO EXISTING ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL NETWORKS. THE EXPERIMENT TESTED THE CONCEPT OF A
VIRTUAL-SYSTEM MODE OF ACCESS TO A NETWORK OF HETEROGENEOUS INTERACTIVE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATA BASES. AN EXPERIMENTAL TRANSLATING COMPUTER
INTERFACE NAMED CONIT WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESEARCH TEST VEHICLE. THE INTERFACE
WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF 3 DIFFERENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS EASY TO USE, EVEN BY INEXPERIENCED USERS, BY PROVIDING A
SIMPLIFIED COMMON COMMAND LANGUAGE COUPLED WITH EXTENSIVE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SEARCHES CONDUCTED FOR ENGINEERS.
     
REPORTS AN INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION SPECIALIST'S EXPERIENCE IN PERFORMING
ON-LINE SEARCHES FOR ENGINEERS AND SURVEYS THE DATA BASES USED. ENGINEERS
SEEKING ASSISTANCE FALL INTO 3 CATEGORIES' (1) THOSE WHO RECOGNISE THE VALUE
OF ON-LINE RETRIEVAL; (2) REFERRALS BY COLLEAGUES; AND (3) THOSE WHO DO NOT
SEEK HELP. AS MORE SUCCESSFUL SEARCHES FOR COLLEAGUES ARE PERFORMED THIS
LATTER CATEGORY TENDS TO DECLINE. DATA BASES MOST COMMONLY USED AT EXXON
RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING COMPANY ARE COMPENDEX, APILIT, CA SEARCH, AND NTIS.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
LEVELS OF QUESTION FORMULATION IN NEGOTIATION OF INFORMATION NEED DURING THE
ONLINE RESEARCH INTERVIEW' A PROPOSED MODEL.
     
OUTLINES 4 LEVELS OF QUESTION FORMULATION WHICH PERTAIN TO THE
CLIENT-INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEW SESSION. THE LITERATURE WHICH
SUPPORTS TAYLOR'S THEORY IS COVERED. IT IS PROPOSED THAT 4 LEVELS MAY BE
INADEQUATE FOR DESCRIBING QUESTION NEGOTIATION IN THE ON-LINE PRESEARCH
INTERVIEW. AN ALTERED MODEL IS GIVEN WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR TESTING THE MODEL IN
THE ON-LINE ENVIRONMENT. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF
DISCOVERING SUCH A MODEL ARE OFFERED.
ONLINE DATA SEARCHING AS A TOOL FOR MOTIVATING INNOVATION.
     
A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE CONTENTION; WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A REVIEW
OF THE LITERATURE THAT ACCESS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF IDEAS AND NOVELTY WILL TEND
TO STIMULATE INNOVATION. THE EXPERIMENT CONSISTED OF A STUDY OF ATTITUDE
CHANGES THROUGH PRE- AND POST-TEST ADMINISTRATION OF A RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE
TO A GROUP OF 20 VOLUNTARY PARTICIPANTS FROM A SMALL HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
BEFORE AND AFTER A 60-DAY PERIOD OF EXPOSURE TO ON-LINE SEARCHING. EVALUATION
USING STANDARD STATISTICAL TESTS INDICATED THAT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN PERCEIVED LEVEL OF INNOVATION OCCURRED AFTER THE SUBJECT'S
EXPOSURE TO ON-LINE DATA SEARCHING. IN ADDITION, A DIRECT AND POSITIVE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PERCEIVED LEVEL OF NEW IDEA GENERATION AND THE
FREQUENCY OF ON-LINE SEARCHING WAS OBSERVED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

INTERACTIVE 2-WAY TELEVISION TO AID THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES IN 3
GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE SATELLITE STATIONS IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, MAINE.
THE EURONET TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK-ITS FUTURE ROLE?.
     
THE EURONET TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IS A PACKET BASED DATA NETWORK
INITIALLY PROVIDED TO ENABLE LOW COST ACCESS TO BE OBTAINED TO SCIENTIFIC,
TECHNICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA BASES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC
COMMUNITY. IT HAS HOWEVER SERVED AS A MEANS TO STANDARDISE DATA COMMUNICATIONS
PROTOCOLS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND HAS PROVIDED A STIMULUS FOR
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADMINISTRATIONS TO ESTABLISH NOT ONLY NATIONAL NETWORKS
WHICH WHEN INTERCONNECTED WILL ENABLE THE INITIAL EURONET NETWORK TO BE
ABSORBED, BUT ALSO NEW SERVICES CAPABLE OF UTILISING PACKET SWITCHED NETWORKS.
THE PLANNED AVAILABILITY OF THESE NETWORKS ON A EUROPEAN SCALE IS NOW
PROVIDING A STIMULUS TO MANUFACTURERS OF DATA TERMINALS TO MAKE AVAILABLE NEW
RANGES OF EQUIPMENT CAPABLE OF EXPLOITING THE SPECIAL FACILITIES OFFERED BY A
PACKET BASED NETWORK FOR MESSAGE TRANSMISSION AND EURONET COULD PROVIDE A
TESTBED TO ASSIST IN THIS DEVELOPMENT.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATUS OF UK VIDEOTEX AND TELETEXT IS PRESENTED. THE
EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS BEEN GAINED THROUGH PRESTEL, CEEFAX AND ORACLE IS
DISCUSSED. AREAS WHERE DISTINCT TRENDS ARE SEEN ARE KINDS OF MATERIAL MOST
READILY ACCEPTABLE, GROWTH RATES, AND TYPES OF USER. THE DIFFERENT POTENTIALS
OF INTERACTIVE AND NON-INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED. THE POTENTIAL THREAT
TO NEWSPAPERS IN UK AND USA IS CONSIDERED.
THE HOME TV AS AN INFORMATION TERMINAL-THE AUSTRALIAN SCENE.
     
DISCUSSES THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN A MARKET TRIAL OF
AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK USING PRESTEL. ALSO LOOKS AT A PILOT
PROJECT OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY AND THE STATE LIBRARY OF NEW SOUTH WALES TO
PROVIDE DATA FOR ATN 7'S TELETEXT SYSTEM SEVENTEXT REGARDING THE SERVICES THEY
OFFER.

IS INCLUDED AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR VENDORS. RESEARCH AND TRIALS
IN THIS AREA ARE CRITICALLY EXAMINED.
THE NEW VIEWDATA (PART 2) (IN GERMAN).
     
THE IMPORTANCE OF A COORDINATED COSTING OF VIEWDATA SERVICES FOR THE FUTURE OF
THE TECHNOLOGY IS STRESSED AND PROBLEMS OF AUTHOR COPYRIGHT OF VIEWDATA
MATERIAL ARE CONSIDERED. OTHER TOPICS DISCUSSED INCLUDE' VISUAL QUALITY OF
VIEWDATA OUTPUT; CONNECTION WITH IN-HOUSE COMPUTERS; TRANSFER OF AVAILABLE
DATA INTO A VIEWDATA SYSTEM; COMBINATION OF VIEWDATA AND VIDEO DISC SYSTEMS;
USING VIEWDATA FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL; THE NEW EUROPEAN STANDARD'S IMPLICATIONS
FOR VARIETY OF DESIGN, ACHIEVING COMPARABLE QUALITY WITH PRINT MEDIA.
ANTIOPE AND D.R.C.S.
     
THE DRCS SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN PRODUCING AN IMAGE FOR
VIDEOTEX OR TELETEXT. 3 MAIN AREAS OF APPLICATION ARE DISCUSSED. THE CHARACTER
SET FOR TEXT MATERIAL DIFFERS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. FINE GRAPHICS (FOR
EXAMPLE MAPS) AND REPEATED SYMBOLS (FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRONIC SCHEMATICS) ARE
MADE POSSIBLE USING FEW CHARACTERS. THE PROBLEMS OF USING THE DRCS SYSTEM IN
ANTIOPE ARE DISCUSSED.
TOO MUCH TOO SOON, TOY OR THREAT?.
     
THE CHOICE OF VIEWDATA SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO PRIVATE VIEWDATA PURCHASERS, I.E.
ON EXISTING MAINFRAME OR A DEDICATED SYSTEM, IS EXPLAINED. REASONS ARE GIVEN
FOR THE SLOW SALES OF PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS AND THE 3 MAIN TYPES OF SYSTEM
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ARE DESCRIBED.
GROWTH OF PRIVATE VIEWDATA.
     
INTEREST IN PRIVATE VIEWDATA AND THE GATEWAY SYSTEMS LINKING IT TO OTHER
COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR INTERNAL COMPANY FUNCTIONS INSTEAD OF ELECTRONIC
PUBLISHING IS DISCUSSED AND A TELIDON SYSTEM FOR SMALL ADS AT THE LOS ANGELES
TIMES IS DESCRIBED. THE 3 TYPES OF PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS BASED ON
STAND-ALONE, FRONT-END MINI- AND MAINFRAME COMPUTERS ARE EXAMINED.
APPLICATIONS USING KEYWORD SEARCHING AND COMBINED WITH VOICE RECOGNITION
TECHNIQUES ARE CONSIDERED. THE HOWSON ALGRAPHY HOWTEL PACKAGE CONSISTING OF
DATA BASE, VIEWDATA SET, TRAINING AND A 3 MONTHS TRIAL IS DISCUSSED. THE
LAUNCH OF THE BRITISH TELECOM GATEWAY SERVICE IS DESCRIBED AND THE FUTURE OF
VIEWDATA CONSIDERED.
PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS-A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
A VIEWDATA SYSTEM BRINGS TOGETHER COMPUTER, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND
MICROPROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE WITH A CHEAP, USER
ORIENTED INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION SERVICE. A PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEM OFFERS
FACILITIES FOR DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION OF A MORE SPECIALISED NATURE THAN
IS AVAILABLE ON PUBLIC SYSTEMS SUCH AS PRESTEL, TOGETHER WITH COMPLETE CONTROL
OF THE SYSTEM, WHICH COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE PAGES OF STOCK
LEVEL INFORMATION AS ORDERS ARE ENTERED. THIS MERGES THE CONCEPTS OF VIEWDATA
WITH THOSE OF THE CONVENTIONAL OFFICE COMPUTER. AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT THE USE OF
PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS FOR INFORMATION CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION.
VIEWDATA-THE IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION.
     
EXAMINES SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF VIEWDATA FOR EDUCATION, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO THE POST OFFICE'S PRESTEL SYSTEM. EXPERIMENTS BY POST OFFICE
RESEARCHERS HAVE INCLUDED SIMULATIONS, MULTIPLE CHOICE TESTING AND GRADED
QUIZZES. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE PUBLIC SYSTEM YET, BUT
INTERACTIVE LEARNING IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PRIORITY IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
THE NEW BILDSCHIRMTEXT (IN GERMAN).
     
THE NEW MEDIA COMMITTEE OF THE BORSENVEREIN DES DEUTSCHEN-BUCHHANDELS (WEST
GERMAN BOOK TRADE ASSOCIATION) HAVE INITIATED A DISCUSSION WITH 50 BOOK AND
NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ON THEIR OPINIONS OF THE BILDSCHIRMTEXT (VIEWDATA) TESTS
WHICH HAVE BEEN CONTINUING OVER THE PAST YEAR.
VISUAL DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
THE MOSAIK PROGRAM WHICH IS USED FOR THE GERMAN BILDSCHIRMTEXT VIEWDATA SYSTEM
IS DESCRIBED. A FIELD TEST IS PLANNED TO START IN JUNE 80 AND CONTINUE FOR ONE
YEAR. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM AND REASONS FOR ITS PARTICULAR
CHARACTERISTICS ARE DISCUSSED. EXAMPLES OF SCREEN DISPLAYS ARE GIVEN.
IN FRANCE ITS TELETEL.
     
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE VIDEOTEX TEST CARRIED OUT IN FRANCE, CALLED THE
TELETEL 3V TEST, IN WHICH 2,500 VOLUNTEER HOUSES ARE LINKED TO A NATIONWIDE
NETWORK OF INFORMATION SERVICES. TELETEL IS BASED ON FRANCE'S ANTIOPE STANDARD
AND IN THE TEST THERE ARE 60,000 PRECOMPOSED PAGES WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED BY
THE USER, WHO IS LINKED BY TELEPHONE LINES TO CII-HONEYWELL BULL MINI 6
COMPUTERS IN THE TELETEL COMPUTER CENTRE IN VELIZY. THE REACTION OF SOME OF
THE TEST USERS IS REPORTED.
A LOW COST TERMINAL FOR THE 1980'S' PROJECT GREEN THUMB.
     
THE USA GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING A VIDEOTEXT FARM INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
(FIRS) USING INEXPENSIVE HOME TERMINALS. A DETAILED ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INVOLVED. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTY
COMPUTERS ARE EXPLAINED. THESE ARE ACCESSED THROUGH A TERMINAL OR GREEN THUMB
BOX. THE ORGANISATION OF DATA IN THE SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED. THE FIRS SYSTEM IS
CURRENTLY BEING TESTED AND PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEING
USED ON A DAILY BASIS.
PROJECT GREEN THUMB PILOT' INFORMATION HARVEST FOR FARMERS.

AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION USING A VIDEOTEX PROGRAMME IS DISCUSSED. THE WAY THE
SPECIFICATIONS FOR FARMER TERMINALS AND COUNTY COMPUTERS SERVING THE TERMINALS
WERE DETERMINED, THE PROTOTYPE SOFTWARE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE TEST WAS
DEVELOPED AND A 2 COUNTY TEST WITH 100 FARMERS PER COUNTY WAS CONDUCTED ARE
DESCRIBED. PROVISION OF THE NEEDED PROJECT INFORMATION TO PERMIT EVALUATION OF
THE USEFULNESS AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE INFORMATION AND DISSEMINATION SYSTEM
IS ALSO DISCUSSED. EXTENSION OF THE PILOT TRIAL AND PLANS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE
GREEN THUMB SYSTEMS ARE DESCRIBED.
TELESOFTWARE' PRESTEL INITIATIVE WILL REMOVE THE BARRIERS.
     
PRESTEL HAS PROVIDED THE INITIAL IMPETUS FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL
COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICE AND HAS CAUSED A GREAT INCREASE IN THE
AVAILABILITY OF CHEAP MODEMS. ARGUES THAT TELESOFTWARE (INVOLVING THE
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION OF PROGRAMS AND DATA TO MICROCOMPUTERS) COULD BE 1 OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION FOR HOBBYISTS,
EDUCATION AND BUSINESS USERS. AFTER BRIEFLY DESCRIBING A TELESOFTWARE SYSTEM
DEVELOPED BY THE COUNCIL FOR EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, SUGGESTS HOW A REALISTIC
TELESOFTWARE SERVICE COULD EVOLVE ON PRESTEL.
INTELLIGENT VIEWDATA TERMINALS FOR BUSINESS APPLICATIONS.
     
AN ADVANCED TYPE OF VIEWDATA TERMINAL IS DESCRIBED WHICH HAS APPLICATIONS IN
AN ELECTRONIC OFFICE SYSTEM. THE TERMINAL SUPPLEMENTS THE USUAL VIEWDATA
TERMINAL FEATURES OF COLOUR DISPLAY, GRAPHICS CAPABILITY AND TELEPHONE NETWORK
COMMUNICATION, BY SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED MEMORY STORAGE AND PROCESSING
FACILITIES, AND IS REFERRED TO AS AN INTELLIGENT TERMINAL. A SPECIFIC FEATURE
OF THE INTELLIGENT TERMINAL IS ITS ABILITY TO RUN PROGRAMMES WHICH ARE STORED
ON A CENTRAL COMPUTER. HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND USER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH
DISTINGUISH THE TERMINAL ARE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH THOSE OF EXISTING
VIEWDATA TERMINALS. SEVERAL APPLICATIONS OF AN INTELLIGENT VIEWDATA TERMINAL
IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE ARE PRESENTED.
TELETEXT AND THE CONSUMER.
     
3 YEARS RESEARCH AMONG 600 OWNERS AND RENTERS OF TELETEXT EQUIPPED TVS MADE BY
PHILIPS VIDEO IS REPORTED. THE SURVEY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS USAGE OF THE
SYSTEM AND OBTAIN CONSUMER'S OPINIONS OF THE SERVICE. SALES AND PRICES OF
EQUIPMENT ARE DISCUSSED AND COLLECTION OF SURVEY DATA DESCRIBED. FINDINGS
RELATED TO SOCIAL CLASS, AGE, AND TV VIEWING HABITS OF TELETEXT USERS ARE
PRESENTED AND TELETEXT VIEWING HABITS RELATED TO WEEKLY USAGE, CHANNELS
WATCHED, MOST POPULAR PAGES, AND PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED ARE DISCUSSED. AN
ASSESSMENT OF THE AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF TELETEXT BY THE GENERAL
PUBLIC IS ALSO PRESENTED.
IN SEARCH OF THE ORACLE.
     
FROM ITS BEGINNINGS, THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL OF TELETEXT HAS BEEN
RECOGNISED. TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELETEXT USE IN EDUCATION AND INCLUDES
DETAILS OF EARLY CEEFAX TRIALS, SPECIAL SERVICES FOR THE DEAF, A TELESOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT RUN BY BRIGHTON POLYTECHNIC, AND THE BBC'S COMPUTER
LITERACY PROJECT.
ANTIOPE TELETEXT CAPTIONING.
     
DIGITAL CAPTIONING CAN BE USED IN TELETEXT SYSTEMS AND THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS
TECHNIQUE OVER CONVENTIONAL CAPTIONING ARE EXPLAINED. DIDON IS USED BY ANTIOPE
FOR CAPTIONING. THE USER SELECTS THE PAGE REQUIRED AND THE CAPTIONS CAN BE
TRANSMITTED IN A VARIETY OF FORMATS AND LANGUAGES. THE CAPTIONS MAY BE
SITUATED ANYWHERE ON THE TELETEXT PAGE AND MAY APPEAR IN DIFFERENT PLACES ON
THE SCREEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES.
PLAYCABLE' A TECHNOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVE FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.
     
THE PLAYCABLE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO ALLOW ACCESS TO SOFTWARE PROGRAMS
VIA A HOME TERMINAL AND A TELEVISION. THE TELETEXT AND ANTIOPE SYSTEMS ARE
BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND THE ADVANTAGES OF PLAYCABLE OVER THESE ARE EXPLAINED.
THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A COMPUTER AND CABLE ADAPTOR AND A MASTER TERMINAL.
SCHEMATIC DIAGRAMS SHOW HOW THESE ARE CONNECTED. FIELD TRIALS ARE IN OPERATION
TO TEST THE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS MARKET POTENTIAL.
THOUGHTS ON THE USE OF TELETEXT IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
TELETEXT (BILDSCHIRMTEXT) WAS 1ST SHOWN TO THE GERMAN PUBLIC BY THE FEDERAL
POSTAL SERVICES IN 1977. A COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN TELETEXT, VIDEO TEXT AND
2-WAY CABLE TELEVISION. TELETEXT IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN LIBRARIES; THE
EQUIPMENT CAN BE USED DIRECTLY BY READERS AND INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM
IT AT ANY TIME. SINCE TELETEXT IS A TEXT MEDIUM FOR THE SPEEDY PROVISION OF
TOPICAL INFORMATION IT PRESENTS NO THREAT TO THE BOOK, A MEDIUM FOR READING.
TELETEXT IS ALSO USEFUL IN LIBRARY REQUEST AND LOAN PROCEDURES AND ITS USE CAN
BE IMPLEMENTED IN STAGES, RESULTING IN THE REDUCTION OF COSTS FOR WORK
PROCEDURES AND INFORMATION PROVISION. TELETEXT CONTAINS FEWER ERRORS THAN
PRINTED MATERIAL.
DEVELOPMENT OF AN APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
A SOFTWARE PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ON-LINE SEARCHING THE INSPEC DATA
BASE. CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE PORTABILITY OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT
IT CAN BE RUN ON ANY THIRD GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEM. DETAILS OF THE PACKAGE
AND ITS UTILISATION FOR SDI SERVICE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED.
UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH VISIT AND AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE
MEETING, NEW YORK CITY. US TRIP REPORT-NOVEMBER 1978.
     
IN NOV 78 THE BRITISH LIBRARY FUNDED A VISIT TO PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY TO SEE
AT 1ST HAND THE OPERATION OF THE COMPUTER AIDED LEARNING AND SIMULATION
PACKAGES DEVELOPED FOR TEACHING ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
DATA RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING.
     
DESCRIBES PROBLEM AREAS IN THE ECONOMICS OF DATA BASE VENDING, BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA BASE PUBLISHING AND PRIMARY JOURNAL ARTICLE PUBLISHING. DISCUSSES DATA
BASE HOSTS; DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DATA BASE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY; LINKING TEXTS
AND GRAPHICS; INTEGRATED DATA BASE PUBLISHING; AND RESEARCH IN DOCUMENT
DELIVERY, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF THE ADONIS CONCEPT. CONCLUDES THAT A MUCH
CLOSER RELATIONSHIP NEEDS TO BE FORGED BETWEEN DATA BASE PUBLISHERS,
LIBRARIANS AND END USERS TO ALERT, AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE, ANY
MISMATCH BETWEEN APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND USER ACCEPTABILITY. ALSO
STRESSES THE NEED FOR USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE STANDARDS.
RELATIVE IMPACT OF PRINT AND DATABASE PRODUCTS ON DATABASE PRODUCER EXPENSES
AND INCOME-TRENDS FOR DATABASE PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS BASED ON A THIRTEEN YEAR
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS.
     
A 13-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCES OF A MAJOR DATA BASE PRODUCER ORGANISATION,
WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLISHER OF ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING PRODUCTS, INDICATES
TRENDS REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT BOTH PRINTED PRODUCTS AND DATA BASE PRODUCTS
HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE ORGANISATION. THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'
(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVE
INCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL OR
GROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THERE
HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, AND
NUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THE
NUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCT
SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,
THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FOR
PRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVE
DECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVE
REMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASED
GREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS IN
LIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROM
ANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLE
APPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,
EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOST
PROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
PRODUCTS AND SERVI CES. THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A CONSORTIUM OF DATA
BASE PRODUCERS FOR OFFERING ON-LINE SERVICES IS PROPOSED. THERE APPEARS TO BE
NO ALTERNATIVE TO INCREASING THE PRICES FOR ON-LINE USERS.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND
TRENDS.
     
DESCRIBES THE HISTORY, COMPOSITION, COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT OF DATA BASES,
PARTICULARLY THOSE COVERING THE SOCIAL SCIENCES USED IN THE USA. SUMMARISES
THE HUNGARIAN POSITION IN THIS FIELD AND STRESSES THAT THE USE OF SUCH DATA
BASES IS STILL AT AN EARLY STAGE. AN INCREASE AND COORDINATION OF EFFORT IN
THIS AREA IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.
CAS77 AND CAS7276' A REVIEW.
     
DESCRIBES THE CONTENT, ORGANISATION, SPECIFICATIONS, AND METHODS OF USE OF THE
CAS77 AND CAS7276 ON-LINE FILES OF WORLDWIDE CHEMICAL LITERATURE, PRODUCED BY

SUBJECT SEARCHING, AVAILABLE USER AIDS, AND CHARGES TO USERS ARE DETAILED.
TABLES IDENTIFY DIRECTLY SEARCHABLE DATA ELEMENTS PROVIDED BY SDC AND DATA
BASE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE CAS77 FILE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
EVALUATION OF DOCUMENTARY OUTPUTS FROM INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN CHEMICAL
INDUSTRY.
     
THE AIM OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES IN THE
CHEMICAL INDUSTRY IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA IS TO FIND A METHOD FOR THE EVALUATION OF
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS USED.
THEY ARE' CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS DATA BASE, MAGNETIC TAPE SERVICES OF CA
CONDENSATES (CAC), COMPENDEX, AND THE INTERNAL BULLETIN 2SYNTHETIC RESINS 1(IN
CZECH). CRITERIA CHOSEN FOR THE EVALUATION WERE AS FOLLOWS' THE TIME LAG
BETWEEN THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRIMARY SOURCE AND THE CREATION OF THE
SECONDARY INFORMATION; AND TOPICALITY; COMPREHENSIVENESS; INFORMATIVENESS AND
SELECTIVENESS IN INFORMING; COMPREHENSIBILITY; AND PHYSICAL FORM. THE
EVALUATION WAS MADE FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF A SMALL USER GROUP FROM THE APPLIED
RESEARCH SECTION OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY.
AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE FEASIBILITY OF SUBSTITUTING 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1
ON-LINE FOR THE PRINTED COPY IN A MEDIUM-SIZED MEDICAL LIBRARY.
     
IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER A MORE ECONOMICAL AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROVIDING THE
INFORMATION IN THE PRINTED 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1, THE REFERENCE STAFF OF THE
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY (ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI) SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LIBRARY
DESIGNED A STUDY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE ON-LINE VERSION COULD BE SUBSTITUTED
FOR THE PRINTED. FOR 13 WEEKS, PATRONS USING THE PRINTED INDEX WERE OFFERED A
FREE COMPUTER SEARCH IN EXCHANGE FOR EVALUATING THE SEARCH. ONLY 39.6%
ACCEPTED AND 62% OF THESE STILL PLANNED TO REFER TO THE ABSTRACTS LATER, WHICH
ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE PRINTED VERSION. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ON-LINE
VERSION COULD BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE PRINTED INDEX WAS THUS NOT CONFIRMED.
AGRICOLA.
     
AGRICOLA (AGRICULTURAL ONLINE ACCESS) IS A FAMILY OF DATA BASES CONSISTING OF
INDEXES TO WORLDWIDE JOURNAL AND MONOGRAPHIC LITERATURE AND US GOVERNMENT
REPORTS ON GENERAL AGRICULTURE AND RELATED SUBJECT FIELDS. IT INCLUDES
CITATIONS TO MONOGRAPHS, SERIAL TITLES AND JOURNAL ARTICLES SELECTED FROM
6,000 SERIAL TITLES FROM 1970 TO THE PRESENT, AND A FILE SIZE OF OVER 1.4
MILLION RECORDS. IT IS PREPARED BY TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, SCIENCE AND
EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION, US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. DESCRIBES ITS SUBFILES

FACTORS IN DATABASE ACQUISITION.
     
EXAMINES (1) SUBJECT CONTENT, (2) FILE SIZE, (3) TYPES OF DOCUMENTS INDEXED,
(4) RANGE OF YEARS SPANNED, AND (5) LEVEL OF INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING IN 5
DATA BASES WHICH COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE FORESTRY AND
FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRIES' AGRICOLA, 2CAB ABSTRACTS, FOREST PRODUCTS,
PAPERCHEM1 AND 2PIRA ABSTRACTS1. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE DATA BASES OVERLAP
AND COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AFFECT
DATA BASE ACQUISITION BY A COMMERCIAL ON-LINE VENDOR ARE EXPLORED. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
COMPUTER-ASSISTED PRODUCTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES IN HISTORY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA BASES IN THE
HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, MADRID 16-19 JUNE 80. DESCRIBES THE USE OF A
COMPUTERISED TEXT PROCESSING SYSTEM TO PRODUCE PRINTED AND ON-LINE VERSIONS OF
THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES IN HISTORY-2HISTORICAL ABSTRACTS1 AND 2AMERICA'
HISTORY AND LIFE1. ABSTRACTS OR CITATIONS OF BOOKS, ARTICLES AND DISSERTATIONS
ARE EDITED, SUBJECT-CLASSIFIED, AND SUBJECT AND AUTHOR-INDEXED. THE AMERICAN
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTER'S PROFILE INDEX IS A COMPUTER-ASSISTED, ROTATED STRING
INDEX, THE VOCABULARY IS A COMBINATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE KEY WORDS AND
PREFERRED SUBJECT HEADINGS SELECTED BY EDITOR-INDEXERS. THE PROCESSING SYSTEM
COMPRISES KEYBOARDING, EXTRACTION OF INDEX TERMS, EXPANSION OF ABBREVIATED
INDEX TERMS TO FULL TEXT, FILE CORRECTION, SORTING AND PHOTOCOMPOSITION OF
PAGES. FILES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES ARE SORTED FOR USE IN 1 OR MORE DATA
BASES, AND ANNUAL INDEX FILES ARE MERGED TO PRODUCT CUMULATIVE INDEXES.
A COMPARISON OF TWO WEIGHTING SCHEMES FOR BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
     
DESCRIBES 2 APPROACHES, TIED TOGETHER BY THEIR CONCEPTUAL BASIS IN FUZZY SET
THEORY, FOR REPRESENTING WEIGHTED BOOLEAN REQUESTS. ONE REPRESENTS DIRECTLY
THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPONENT BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS TO THE USER. THE OTHER
ESTABLISHES CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE A DOCUMENT CAN BE RETRIEVED.
BOTH MAY HAVE A PLACE IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS-THEIR RELATIVE
STRENGTHS SHOULD APPEAR THROUGH EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION.
MESSAGE EXTRACTION THROUGH ESTIMATION OF RELEVANCE.
     
ASSOCIATIVE RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES ARE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE WHEN A DATA BASE
CONTAINS INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF FULL TEXT AND THE COLLECTION OF TEXTS IS
LARGE AND CHANGING SO FAST THAT NO USER CAN BE FAMILIAR WITH ITS CONTENTS. THE
METER (MESSAGE EXTRACTION THROUGH ESTIMATION OF RELEVANCE) SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED
TO APPLY SUCH STRATEGIES EFFECTIVELY AND INEXPENSIVELY FOR A CHANGING DATA
BASE OF UP TO 20,000 MESSAGES (TEXTS OR DOCUMENTS) OF ABOUT 2,000 CHARACTERS
EACH, WITH NEW MESSAGES ARRIVING AT THE RATE OF 4,000-5,000 DAILY. IT RUNS ON
A DEC PDP-11/45 MINICOMPUTER WITHOUT SPECIAL HARDWARE, WITH A RESPONSE TIME OF
ABOUT A MINUTE FOR 5 SIMULTANEOUS USERS, AND WITH NEARLY 24 HOURS/DAY ACCESS.
DESCRIBES THE SYSTEM, ITS BASIC THEORY, AND ITS EVALUATION.
ESTABLISHING A BASIS FOR MAPPING NATURAL-LANGUAGE STATEMENTS ONTO A DATABASE
QUERY LANGUAGE.
     
DESCRIBES A PROJECT ON INFORMAL (NATURAL)/FORMAL (DATA BASE QUERY) LANGUAGE
MAPPING. A BASIS WAS DEVELOPED FOR PROCESSING ENGLISH-LANGUAGE REQUESTS FOR
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FROM AN EXISTING DBMS (DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM). THE
ROLE OF EACH WORD IN THE NATURAL-LANGUAGE QUERY WAS IDENTIFIED BY 2 SEPARATE
METHODS-A LEARNING ALGORITHM AND A STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE. THE PROGRAMME WAS
RUN WITH A SET OF 400 SENTENCES FROM A BASIC SCIENCE BOOK. THE RESULTS, WHICH
WERE JUDGED TO BE ENCOURAGING, ARE DISCUSSED.
A PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM FOR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR SEARCHING.
     
A DETERMINISTIC NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR SEARCH ALGORITHM IS MODIFIED SO THAT THE
USER CAN SPECIFY A MAXIMUM TOLERABLE LEVEL OF ERROR. THIS TOLERANCE ALLOWS
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ALGORITHM TO BE HANDLED PROBABILISTICALLY AND THIS, IN
TURN, ALLOWS AN IMPROVEMENT IN SEARCH SPEED DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF
ERROR PERMITTED. THUS, SEARCH TIME CAN BE TRADED OFF AGAINST SEARCH
EFFECTIVENESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM IS SUBSTANTIALLY
FASTER THAN THE DETERMINISTIC, WITH ONLY A VERY SMALL LOSS IN RETRIEVAL
QUALITY.
BROWSING THROUGH DATABASES.
     
PRESENTS THE BROWSE SYSTEM, THE GOAL OF WHICH IS TO PROVIDE BROWSING ACCESS TO
DATA BASES BY BUILDING THE SEARCH HEURISTICS DIRECTLY INTO THE DATA BASE AS
QUICK ACCESS PATHS BETWEEN RELATED RECORDS.
COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL-CLOSED OR OPEN: SOME CRITERIA FOR A CLOSED
SYSTEM.
     
DESCRIBES WHAT IS MEANT BY 'CLOSED' AND 'OPEN' COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL AND THE VARIATIONS IN BETWEEN. FACTORS SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT DEGREES
OF CONSTRAINT ARE: ACCESS TO DATA, ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM, IDENTITY OF USERS AND
METHOD OF ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM. DISCUSSES IN DETAIL THE LEXIS LEGAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM, STRESSING THE FEATURES WHICH INDICATE THAT IT IS A CLOSED
SYSTEM, EXPLAINING THE RESULTANT ADVANTAGES.
RETRIEVING TIME INFORMATION FROM NATURAL-LANGUAGE TEXTS.
     
PRESENTS A PROCEDURE (DEVELOPED DURING RESEARCH IN NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING
AT THE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LINGUISTIC STRING PROJECT) TO AUTOMATICALLY
RETRIEVE FROM HOSPITAL DISCHARGE SUMMARIES INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT'S STATE
AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING A HOSPITAL STAY AND INFORMATION ABOUT PERFORMANCE OF
CERTAIN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND THEIR RESULTS.
AN EXPERIMENT IN CLASSIFICATION: BASED ON WILLIAM GOFFMAN'S 'INDIRECT METHOD'
OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PREPARED FOR A CLASSIFICATION THEORY COURSE AT CASE WESTERN
RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO, A REVISED VERSION OF WHICH WAS PRESENTED AT A
CANADIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON, ONTARIO, MAY 78.
DESCRIBES AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCUMENT
CLASSES RETRIEVED USING GOFFMAN'S INDIRECT METHOD; HOW THESE CLASSES ARE
SIMILAR TO, OR DIFFERENT FROM, THE CLASSES OBTAINED WHEN A FACETED
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IS APPLIED TO THE SAME SET OF DOCUMENTS; AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CLUSTERS OF TERMS WHICH INTER-RELATE A DEFINABLE CLASS
OF DOCUMENTS. A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 101 ENTRIES IN THE SUBJECT INDEXING SECTION
OF 2LISA1, 1976, WERE USED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE INDIRECT METHOD
COULD HAVE SOME MERIT IN SEARCH STRATEGIES IN COMPUTERISED INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS BASED ON KEYWORDS OR A CONTROLLED VOCABULARY.
INTRA COMPANY COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS.
     
ATTEMPTS TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT IN EXISTING
COMPANY COMMUNICATIONS AS OFFICE AUTOMATION PROCEEDS. THE INCREASED USE OF
VIDEO DISPLAY UNITS WILL INCREASE THE NEED FOR HIGH SPEED DATA TRANSFERS AND
THE CENTRAL STORAGE OF GENERAL DATA MADE READILY ACCESSIBLE TO EACH USER BY
HIS OWN TERMINAL WILL PLACE MORE PRESSURE ON COMPANY COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AND DEMANDS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER EXISTING INSTALLATIONS. EXAMINES VARIOUS
ALTERNATIVES IN TERMS OF THEIR TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, VIABILITY AND RELATIVE
COSTS.
TELEMATICS AND LONG-DISTANCE TRANSMISSION (IN FRENCH).
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELEMATICS IN FRANCE IS ANALYSED. ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL
TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN CABLE
TV, SATELLITE TRANSMISSION, TELEX, FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION, TELECONFERENCING,
TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AND A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN
TELEPHONE SETS. THE HISTORY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS VIA ORBITAL SATELLITES IS
ALSO OUTLINED.
AUTOMATED OFFICE, NOT QUITE HERE YET.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUTOMATED OFFICE IS CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF A RECENT
IDC EUROCAST STUDY; 2AUTOMATED OFFICE OVERVIEWED WESTERN EUROPE1. OVER THE
NEXT DECADE, THE MAIN GROWTH WILL BE IN WORD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, PABX,
ELECTRONIC MAIL, INTELLIGENT COPIERS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. THE
MAIN MARKETS WILL BE IN WEST GERMANY, FRANCE AND THE UK; THESE COUNTRIES WILL
ACCOUNT FOR 2/3 OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET. A PROFILE OF THE OFFICE OF 1990 IS
INCLUDED AND SOFTWARE OPTIONS, AND EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE
DISCUSSED. THE EUROPEAN MARKET IS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE USA
MARKETPLACE.
INFORMATION HANDLING IN THE OFFICE OF THE FUTURE.
     
INFORMATION HANDLING IN THE OFFICE OF THE 1980S WILL ASSUME NEW CONCEPTUAL
DIMENSIONS, AS THE POWER, ECONOMY AND USER-EMPATHY OF A NEW GENERATION OF
MICROPROCESSOR-BASED EQUIPMENT OPEN UP NEW AVENUES OF SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND
APPLICATIONS POTENTIAL. DISCUSSES INCREASING ECONOMY AND RELIABILITY OF
COMPUTERS, USER-EMPATHY, INTEGRATED INFORMATION HANDLING AND COMMUNICATION.
HOMOGENISING THE CORPORATE INFORMATION RESOURCE, AND DEVISING SYSTEMS TO MAKE
IT UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO EACH POTENTIAL USER AT THE LEVEL
REQUIRED AND IS AUTHORISED TO WORK AT, CALLS FOR A NEW BREED OF INFORMATION
SCIENTIST-CUM-DIPLOMAT NOT YET SEEN ON ANY EXTANT CORPORATE SCENARIO.
CORPORATE PLANNING AND THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
REVIEWS FUNDAMENTAL ACTIVITIES OF DEPARTMENTS COMPRISING A TYPICAL
MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND DEVELOPS THE THEME FOR ELECTRONIC AND COMPUTER BASED
AIDS FOR RE-SHAPING THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION FUNCTIONS OF SUCH A COMPANY. AN
ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRIBUTION MADE TO A COMPANY OPERATION BY SUCH SPECIALISTS
AS SALES ENGINEERS, DESIGNERS, PLANNING, TOOLING ENGINEERS AND ACCOUNTANTS
SHOWS THAT OFFICES ARE TRADITIONALLY DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE GENERATION,
TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PAPER. THE ADVENT OF THE COMPUTER, V.D.U. AND
TELEVISION LINK HAVE CHALLENGED THE ROLE OF PAPER AS A COMMUNICATION MEDIUM. A
TYPICAL ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE, ARISING FROM DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SCHEME IS
SUGGESTED TOGETHER WITH A BLOCK SCHEMATIC OF A TYPICAL REMOTELY MANNED
INTERACTIVE DATA TERMINAL THAT WILL ENABLE STAFF TO WORK FROM HOME IF
REQUIRED. THE RAMIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYMENT METHODS, PROJECT MANAGEMENT
PROBLEMS, MOTIVATION AND POSSIBLE METHODS OF REMUNERATION ARE DI SCUSSED.
HUMAN FACTOR ASPECT OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
RADICAL CHANGES CAN RESULT FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OFFICE TECHNOLOGY INTO
THE WORKPLACE. SUCH CHANGES, IF BROUGHT ABOUT WITHOUT CONCERN FOR THE NEEDS OF
THE USER, WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RESULT IN NON OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE AND AN
INADEQUATE RETURN ON A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT. STUDIES THE INTERFACE BETWEEN
THE USER AND THE SYSTEM AND HAS MUCH TO OFFER IN ALLEVIATING THE PROBLEMS
WHICH ARISE WHEN THAT INTERFACE UNDERGOES CHANGE. POTENTIALLY TROUBLESOME
AREAS ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE APPROPRIATE HUMAN FACTORS ASPECTS EXPLAINED.
THESE AREAS ARE' VISUAL DISPLAYS, ENTERING THE INFORMATION, WORKSTATION
DESIGN, INSTRUCTIONS, AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY.
HUMAN CHOICES IN THE OFFICE OF THE FUTURE.
     
A KEY FACTOR IN THE WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF COMPLEX OFFICE
INFORMATION SYSTEMS WILL BE THE HUMAN FACTORS OF THE SYSTEM. MENTIONS SOME OF
THE LIKELY PROBLEM AREAS AND BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE RELEVANT HUMAN FACTORS
TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS. THE USER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
COMPONENT AND HIS REACTIONS TO THE SYSTEM WILL DECIDE WHETHER ITS INTRODUCTION
IS A SUCCESS OR FAILURE.
THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE AND THE QUALITY OF WORKING LIFE.
     
IT IS COMMONLY CLAIMED THAT THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY TO THE OFFICE
REDUCES ROUTINE LABOUR AND FREES THE EMPLOYEE FOR MORE CREATIVE WORK. DISPUTES
THIS CLAIM BY EXAMINING IN DETAIL THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ON THE JOB
CONTENT AND JOB SATISFACTION OF 2 TYPES OF CLERICAL JOBS' PRODUCTION CONTROL
AND TELE-SALES. THE SOURCE OF THE DECLINE IN THE QUALITY OF WORKING LIFE IN
THESE 2 AREAS IS LOCATED NOT IN THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF BUT MANAGEMENT AIMS AND
METHODS IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. SUGGESTS POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF WORK
ORGANISATION.
THE 'ELECTRONIC OFFICE'-THE IMPACT OF ORGANISATIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL FACTORS.
     
DISCUSSES FACTORS PROMOTING CHANGE IN THE OFFICE ENVIRONMENT-GOVERNMENTAL
ENCOURAGEMENT, TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS, GREATER EFFICIENCY FOR ORGANISATIONS,
SUPPLIERS AND THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET. ALSO DESCRIBES ATTITUDINAL,
ORGANISATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY FACTORS AGAINST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.
OUTLINES PRESSURES ON ORGANISATIONS TO ADOPT NEW METHODS AND THE ROLE OF THE
GOVERNMENT. CONCLUDES THAT IN THE NEXT DECADE SOCIETY'S ATTITUDES WILL
INFLUENCE ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICE AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHO WILL CARRY THE MAJOR
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS ARE PROPERLY DEALT
WITH.
OFFICE SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE.
     
OFFICES ARE ORGANISATIONAL UNITS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PROCESSED BY PEOPLE.
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THESE
PEOPLE BEFORE WE ATTEMPT TO DESIGN SYSTEMS FOR THEM. WE NEED MODELS OF OFFICES
AND OF OFFICE WORK, FOR USE AS A BASIS FOR SYSTEM DESIGN AND SYSTEM
EVALUATION. MODELS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH STUDIES OF OFFICES AND IN
PARTICULAR THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF HOW ELECTRONIC OFFICE SYSTEMS IMPACT OFFICE
WORK. SUMMARISES RECENT RESEARCH WORK IN THESE AREAS, AND SHOWS HOW IT CAN
ASSIST US IN DESIGNING SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OFFICE WORKERS.
COMPUTING SERVICES ASSOCIATION STUDY ON TEXT PROCESSING.
     
DESCRIBES A *61/3 MILLION CONSULTANCY STUDY BY THE COMPUTING SERVICES
ASSOCIATION ON TEXT PROCESSING. THE PROJECT HAS 3 PARTS' PART 1-BACKGROUND
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORK PROGRAMME FOR TEXT PROCESSING STRATEGY
STUDIES AND SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS FOR PART 2; PART 2-UNDERTAKING
INDIVIDUAL TEXT PROCESSING STRATEGY STUDIES FOR 10 MAJOR UK ORGANISATIONS; AND
PART 3-SUMMARY OF RESULTS TO PRODUCE REPORTS RELEVANT TO BOTH USERS AND
MANUFACTURERS OF NEW TEXT PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE STUDY WAS SPONSORED BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF TRADE.
THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
DESCRIBES THE FUNCTIONS AND EQUIPMENT OF THE FORECAST 'ELECTRONIC OFFICE' BY
CONSIDERING IN FUNDAMENTAL TERMS THE FUNCTIONS OF AN 'OFFICE' AND THE WAYS IN
WHICH MATURE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE DEPLOYED TO HELP
PEOPLE CARRY OUT SUCH FUNCTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT EVEN AFTER THE TECHNOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED, THE TIMING IS LIKELY TO BE DETERMINED BY A
COMMERCIAL STICK/SLIP PROCESS SO THAT FOR A LONG TIME THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL
HAVE LITTLE IMPACT UPON NORMAL MODES OF OFFICE WORK BUT WHEN CHANGES START
OCCURRING THEY WILL PROCEED FURTHER AND FASTER THAN WE WOULD LIKE.
AN OFFICE INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN STUDY.
     
DESCRIBES A STUDY UNDERTAKEN IN THE SUMMER OF 1979 OF THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE OF
QUEEN MARY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. ITS PURPOSES WERE' TO PROVIDE A
BETTER FEEL FOR THE TASKS AND PROBLEMS OF OFFICE INFORMATION PROCESSING; TO
DEVELOP METHODS FOR DESCRIBING OFFICES AND THE PROCEDURES EMPLOYED TO PROCESS
OFFICE INFORMATION AND TO IDENTIFY USEFUL INDICATORS OF OFFICE EFFECTIVENESS;
AND TO CREATE A DATA BASE OF PROCEDURE DESCRIPTIONS FROM WHICH A DESIGN FOR AN
EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM COULD BE DRAWN AND TESTED FOR FUNCTIONAL
COMPLETENESS. INTRODUCES PROBLEMS THAT DESIGNERS OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE MUST
CONSIDER AND SUGGESTS SOLUTIONS.
WORD PROCESSING' AN INTRODUCTION.
     
THE INTRODUCTORY REVIEW OF WORD PROCESSING, ITS DEVELOPMENT AND TERMINOLOGY,
IS FOLLOWED BY REVIEWS OF 4 WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS (P 11-35, 56-61).
INFORMATION-AND OFFICE TECHNOLOGY.
     
THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT IS TO POINT OUT SOME EXAMPLES OF MODERN
DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, PRESENTED AT THE HANOVER
FAIR 1981. EXPECIALLY CONSIDERED ARE DEVELOPMENTS IN MICROFILM, DATA- AND TEXT
PROCESSING AND GENERAL OFFICE TECHNOLOGY.
BRITISH RAIL'S ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY.
     
DESCRIBES A STUDY INITIATED IN 1976 BY BRITISH RAIL TO EXAMINE WHAT AND HOW
INFORMATION WAS PROCESSED, OPTIONS AVAILABLE, AND TO DESIGN AN ADMINISTRATIVE
COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY. THE OBJECTIVES WERE' INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY; COST
REDUCTION, AVOIDANCE AND CONTROL; IMPROVED QUALITY OF SERVICE TO THE
FUNCTIONS; IMPROVED WORK ENVIRONMENT; AND IMPROVED MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATIONS
AND CONTROL. DESCRIBES THE REASONS FOR A STRATEGY TO BE ESTABLISHED, AND AIMS
AND BENEFITS OF ADOPTING SUCH A STRATEGY WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PROVIDE FOR
CONVERGENCE OF TEXT AND DATA SYSTEMS AND FOR HIGH SPEED COMMUNICATIONS AND
ELECTRONIC MAILING BETWEEN ALL MAJOR BR LOCATIONS.
THE MICROWRITER.
     
CURRENTLY THE MICROWRITER IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW WAY OF WRITING IN ALMOST
ANY ENVIRONMENT, WITH ONLY 1 HAND, AND WITH THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY OF
BEING ABLE TO STORE, RETRIEVE, EDIT, FORMAT AND TRANSMIT WRITTEN INFORMATION
EITHER AS THE PRINTED WORD, OR IN CONVERTIBLE MACHINE LANGUAGE. SEPARATED FROM
THE MICROWRITER, THE 5 FINGER KEYBOARD COULD BE FITTED TO CONVENTIONAL
EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS TYPEWRITERS, WORD PROCESSING UNITS, TELEX AND COMPUTERS,
GIVING ACCESS TO NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND NEED TO
COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE EQUIPMENT, BUT ARE UNABLE TO MASTER THE
OPERATION OF THE QWERTY KEYBOARD EFFICIENTLY! IN THESE CASES THE MICROWRITER
KEYBOARD WILL BE A PERIPHERAL IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL KEYBOARD, AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EQUIPMENT WILL OPERATE IN THE NORMAL WAY.
A STUDY OF THE ARMY'S WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM WITH CASES.
     
DEMONSTRATES POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF A WORD PROCESSING/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM. A MODEL IS
PRESENTED ON PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND MAINTAINING A WORD
PROCESSING/ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM. A COMPARISON IS MADE OF THE GUIDANCE
CONTAINED IN AR 340-8 AND THE GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT WORD
PROCESSING LITERATURE AS PERTAINS TO THE ACTIVITIES PRESENTED IN THE MODEL.
VISUAL ASPECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
SOME OF THE VISUAL TASKS INVOLVED IN USING A VDT DIFFER IN KIND FROM THOSE
ENCOUNTERED IN A TRADITIONAL OFFICE. THE SELF-LUMINOUS NATURE OF THE SCREEN
CHARACTERS AND THE 3 TASK AREAS OF SOURCE MATERIAL, KEYBOARD AND SCREEN
PRESENT A CHALLENGE TO THE LIGHTING DESIGNER AND ERGONOMIST. SUITABLE
COMBINATIONS OF LIGHT SOURCE AND LUMINAIRE AND THE RELATIVE LOCATIONS OF ALL
THE ELEMENTS INVOLVED CAN PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS BUT DUE RECOGNITION
SHOULD BE PAID TO THE OPHTHALMIC REQUIREMENTS OF OPERATORS.
DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR OFFICE SYSTEMS.
     
CONSIDERS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN IDEAL OFFICE DISPLAY AND COMPARES CRT
(CATHODE RAY TUBES) WITH MATRIX DISPLAYS TO SEE HOW CLOSELY THEY CAN MEET
REQUIREMENTS. THE CRT CAN MEET THE DISPLAY FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS BUT IS NOT
IDEAL IN SPACE TAKEN, POWER AND WEIGHT. NO OTHER DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY CAN MEET
THE RANGE OF FUNCTION REQUIRED BUT THEY HAVE ATTRACTIONS IN SIZE AND SHAPE AND
AS TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE MAY MEET THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
DISPLAY SYSTEMS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
DESCRIBES 2 RESEARCH PROJECTS BASED IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY AT
QUEEN MARY COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. ONE PROJECT, ALREADY COMPLETED, HAS
PRODUCED A NEW PIECE OF HARDWARE-THE 'Q.M.C. TEXT TERMINAL'-WHICH IS A DISPLAY
SYSTEM INCORPORATING 2 PROCESSORS WHICH ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO PROVIDING A
HIGHLY USER-ORIENTED DISPLAY OF TEXTUAL INFORMATION. THE OTHER PROJECT, STILL
IN PROGRESS, AIMS TO DEVELOP A RADICALLY NEW DISPLAY PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY, THE
HOPE BEING THAT IT WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE SPEED OF IMAGE GENERATION
IN BITMAP DISPLAY SYSTEMS.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
THE WORK STATION OF THE EXECUTIVE OF THE FUTURE WILL EVOLVE FROM THE
COMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSOR (CWP) AND WILL INCORPORATE THE BASIC FACILITIES
PROVIDED BY THE CWP FOR INPUT, TEXT DISPLAY, TEXT MANIPULATION, HARD COPY
OUTPUT AND COMMUNICATION. THE ENHANCEMENT OF THESE FACILITIES WILL RESULT FROM
THE ADDITION OF FEATURES CURRENTLY FOUND IN STAND ALONE DEVICES. DESCRIBES
SOME OF THE MORE LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS THAT WILL EMERGE FOR INPUT, STORAGE AND
OUTPUT. ALSO DISCUSSES COMMUNICATION AND NETWORK SERVICES AND STANDARDISATION.
THE EXTENSION OF COMPUTER INTELLIGENCE.
     
THE RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL BE ACCELERATED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MICROPROCESSORS. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WILL LEAD TO THE INTEGRATION AND
EXTENSION OF MANY OF THE TOOLS OF TODAY. A COROLLARY OF THIS WILL BE THAT THE
INTELLIGENCE OF THE LARGE COMPUTERS WILL NOW APPEAR IN OTHER ITEMS OF
EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE OFFICE ENVIRONMENT.
JUSTIFYING THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE-THE NEED FOR AN 'ADDED VALUE' APPROACH.
     
SUGGESTS THAT EMPHASIS ON THE COST-SAVING ELEMENTS OF OFFICE AUTOMATION CAN
HAVE AN OVERALL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ENTERPRISE OR ORGANISATION, AND DISCUSSES
SOME APPROACHES TO AN 'ADDED VALUE' APPROACH, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS OF
ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION, ANALYSIS OF MANAGERIAL WORK, CONCEPT OF PLANNED
SUPPORT LEVELS AND 'DELIVERED SERVICE' JUSTIFICATION.
A NEW CONCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF A FLEXIBLE OFFICE SYSTEM.
     
PRESENTS OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS AS AN APPLICATION OF MICROPROCESSOR BASED
SYSTEMS. THE SMALL SIZE, LOW COST, AND REASONABLY HIGH POWER OF THESE SYSTEMS
ENABLED THEIR USE IN AUTOMATING SOME OFFICE TASKS. PRESENTS A GENERAL
DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL MICROPROCESSOR BASED OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM, THEN
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND USE OF SUCH
SYSTEMS. PROPOSES A SCHEME FOR PARTITIONING AND MODULARISING THE HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE OF THE SYSTEM, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOLUTION OF SOME
PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY, PORTABILITY AND SYSTEM EXTENSIBILITY. THE PROPOSED
SYSTEM CAN BE USED AS A UNIVERSAL BASIC CORE ON WHICH ONE CAN EASILY BUILD
LARGER WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE USER CAN, BY HIMSELF, EXTEND HIS SYSTEM BY
USING THE SAME WORD PROCESSING LANGUAGE HE USES EVERYDAY BECAUSE OF ITS
SPECIAL PROPERTIES PRESENTED HERE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO SIMPLY RECONFIGURABLE AT
THE WILL OF THE USER TO EXACTLY FI T HIS NEEDS AT ANY TIME.
SCRAPBOOK-A GENERAL PURPOSE INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM.
     
THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE OF THE FUTURE WILL REQUIRE A SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION
HANDLING FRAMEWORK ON WHICH TO BASE SUCH FACILITIES AS ELECTRONIC MAIL,
FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION AND WORD PROCESSING. SCRAPBOOK REPRESENTS AN EARLY
STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES FACILITIES FOR
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, ELECTRONIC MAIL AND WORD PROCESSING, AND MAY BE READILY
ADAPTED TO INCORPORATE MORE SPECIALISED FACILITIES FOR PARTICULAR USERS. THE
EMPHASIS IS ON FLEXIBILITY, SO THAT CHANGING USER REQUIREMENTS MAY BE MET WITH
LITTLE OR NO REPROGRAMMING EFFORT.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE ON THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE' THE LONDON PENTA
HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND, TUESDAY 22ND TO FRIDAY 25TH APRIL 1980.
     
PROCEEDINGS OF A CONFERENCE ORGANISED BY THE INSTITUTION OF ELECTRONIC AND
RADIO ENGINEERS ON THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE INSTITUTION
OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS, THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS
ENGINEERS, THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF BUILDING SERVICES AND THE BRITISH
COMPUTER SOCIETY, LONDON, 22-25 APR 80. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
PAPERS, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
PALANTYPE MACHINE SHORTHAND IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE.
     
REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SPEECH TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEM
FOR THE DEAF. THE EQUIPMENT CONVERTS PALANTYPE MACHINE SHORTHAND INTO ENGLISH
SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND DISPLAYS THE TEXT ON A VISUAL DISPLAY FOR THE DEAF
PERSON(S) TO READ. EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM TRIALS WITH DEAF BUSINESS EXECUTIVES
AND AT MEETINGS ATTENDED BY THE DEAF INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM ALSO HAS
APPLICATIONS IN THE ELECTRONIC OFFICE, AND IN VERBATIM REPORTING. THESE
SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL AND COMPARIONS ARE MADE WITH
CONVENTIONAL QWERTY KEYBOARD INPUT WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS, AND WITH
STENOGRAPH MACHINE SHORTHAND TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR VERBATIM
REPORTING IN THE USA.

WHICH ROUTE FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL?.
     
ELECTRONIC MAIL IS LIKELY TO BECOME A MAJOR BUSINESS APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT
FEW YEARS, BUT THE FORM IT WILL TAKE IS LESS CLEAR. SYSTEMS BASED AROUND
FACSIMILE OR COMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSORS COULD BE POPULAR BECAUSE WHILE
TRANSMITTING LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY, THEY REQUIRE FEW
CHANGES TO EXISTING OFFICE PROCEDURES. COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SYSTEMS REQUIRE
CHANGES IN USER HABITS, BUT ALSO OFFER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS, E.G. IMPROVED
MANAGERIAL EFFECTIVENESS AND A REDUCTION IN THE TIME SPENT ON CLERICAL TASKS.
HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE FOR COMPUTER MAIL SYSTEMS.
     
AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL FOR LARGE, DISTRIBUTED COMPUTER MAIL SYSTEMS IS
PRESENTED. THIS MODEL SPECIFIES' A MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS THAT
SUPPORTS ALL COMPUTER MAIL FUNCTIONS; THE FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURE OF EACH
COMPONENT; THE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL NEEDED FOR INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION;
AND THE ORGANISATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION DATA BASE USED TO SUPPORT
IDENTIFICATION SERVICES IN THE ARCHITECTURE. THE COMPUTER MAIL PROTOCOL OF THE
ARCHITECTURE IS SPECIFIED FOLLOWING THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REFERENCE MODEL FOR
OPEN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES PROPOSED BY THE ISO, AND EACH LAYER OF THE PROTOCOL
IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. THE ORGANISATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION DATA BASE IS
BASED ON THE SAME LAYERING CONCEPT, AND SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE ROLE
OF IDENTIFICATION SERVICES IN LARGE SYSTEMS AND THE INTERCONNECTION OF VARIOUS
SYSTEMS.
FONOFAX SF' AN AUTOMATIC DOCUMENT TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.
     
THE BRITISH POST OFFICE HAS RECENTLY COMPLETED DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED
STORE AND FORWARD FACSIMILE TERMINAL. IT PROVIDES FOR FAST DOCUMENT LOADING
AND STORAGE, HAS MANY SOPHISTICATED FACILITIES AND OFFERS A SERVICE WITH HIGH
INTEGRITY. TRANSMISSION IS EFFECTED USING STANDARD FACSIMILE METHODS TO ENSURE
MAXIMUM COMPATIBILITY WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT.
THE COMMUNICATIONS REVOLUTION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AS THE 14TH ANNUAL LECTURE AT THE ROYAL AERONAUTICAL SOCIETY,
LONDON, 9 JUN 81. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS
AND INFORMATION REVOLUTION' THE PROCESSES AND PHENOMENA WHICH WE VAGUELY BUT
DEFINITELY FEEL ARE CHANGING SOCIETY AND OUR OUTLOOK ON SOCIETY, OUR RELATIONS
TO WORK AND LEISURE, OUR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER AND OURSELVES.
AUTOMATION OF A MILITARY COMMUNICATION CENTRE.
     
IN MILITARY OPERATIONS SECURE COMMUNICATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT
INFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED SECURELY, ACCURATELY AND PROMPTLY FROM ORIGINATOR
TO ADDRESSEE. MESSAGE SWITCHING SYSTEMS HAVE IMPROVED MESSAGE AND DATA
HANDLING, THEREBY REDUCING TRANSIT TIMES TO A FEW MINUTES; HOWEVER, WITHIN
COMMUNICATION CENTRES (COMCENS), MESSAGES ARE STILL HANDLED MANUALLY AND
DELAYS OFTEN OCCUR. THE SOLUTION LIES IN THE AUTOMATION OF COMCEN ACTIVITIES
AND THE PROVISION OF DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL USERS. CONSIDERS
AUTOMATION IN TERMS OF PRESENT DAY TECHNOLOGY, AND ANALYSES THE MANUAL
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND THE FUNCTIONAL MESSAGE FLOW THROUGH THE COMCEN TO
THE USERS.
WRITING EFFECTIVE REPORTS.
     
THE RESEARCH APPLICATION AND INFORMATION GROUP'S COURSE ON REPORT WRITING IS
DESIGNED TO HELP NTRR'S AUTHORS BECOME BETTER WRITERS BY GIVING THEM
STRAIGHT-FORWARD RULES FOR BETTER STYLE, AND BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO CRITICISE
AND REVISE THEIR OWN WORK.
TYPEWRITTEN TEXTS AND TYPEWRITING' SOME POINTS ARISING FROM A DISCUSSION ON
FORMULATING A BIBLIOLOGICAL APPROACH.
     
A REPORT OF A FORUM HELD IN OCT 80 BY THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF
THE BOOK, SPONSORED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS
OF GENERAL USE OF TYPEWRITERS FOR TEACHING IN COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FOR
INFORMATICS; AND THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONSEQUENCES WORLDWIDE,
PRESENT AND FUTURE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYPEWRITERS FROM THEIR INVENTION UP TO
THE PRESENT IS TRACED, IN RELATION TO THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION OF OFFICE WORK AND PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT. THE INTRODUCTION OF
SOPHISTICATED MACHINES WHICH DISPENSE WITH TRADITIONAL OPERATORS IS CONSIDERED
AND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLISHING METHODS AND INFORMATION
COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES SURVEYED. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS DEBATED WHETHER
BIBLIOLOGY MIGHT BECOME OUTMODED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AN APPENDIX LISTS THE
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE FORUM.

BIBLIOGRAPHY, COMPRISES MATERIAL RECEIVED THROUGH LEGAL DEPOSIT OR DONATION BY
OSLO UNIVERSITY'S NORWEGIAN DEPARTMENT. IT HAS BEEN COMPUTER-PRODUCED SINCE
1972. NORWEGIAN BOOK PRODUCTION INCREASED BY 105% DURING 1970-78, WHILE
NORWEGIAN PARTICIPATION IN UBC AND ISDS HAS NECESSITATED THE INTRODUCTION OF
AACR, ISBD AND ISBN. STAFFING HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY, AND
CONSIDERABLE ARREARS OF UNCATALOGUED MATERIAL EXIST. THE 5-YEARLY CUMULATION
FOR 1971-75 IS AT PRESENT AVAILABLE IN MACHINE-READABLE FORM ONLY. A
MICROFICHE CATALOGUE OF NORWEGIAN PUBLICATIONS IS PRODUCED BI-MONTHLY, WITH
CUMULATIONS FOR 1971-75 AND 1976-78. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY DATA BASE IS ALREADY PARTLY ON-LINE. INDEXING OF PERIODICAL
ARTICLES, PLANNED FROM 1980, WILL COVER 400 PERIODICALS IN MOST SUBJECT
FIELDS. NEWSPAPE R ARTICLES CANNOT BE COVERED MEANWHILE. THE 2BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS1 (1965-) SHOULD SOON BE INCORPORATED INTO
THE DATA BASE. FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS ABOUT NORWAY (1978-) ARE INDEXED IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM.

REPUBLICS, EACH WITH ITS OWN LANGUAGE, SOME USING ROMAN AND OTHERS CYRILLIC
ALPHABETS. PUBLISHING IS VERY LOCAL AND ONLY NEWSPAPERS IN THESE MINORITY
LANGUAGES ARE OCCASIONALLY AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE AREA OF ORIGIN. BOOKS ARE
LISTED IN THE 2SOVIET NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY1, BUT ONLY IN THE RUSSIAN
LANGUAGE. EACH AUTONOMOUS REPUBLIC ISSUES ITS OWN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, THE

INDIA'S LIBRARIES ARE WAITING.
     
OUTLINES THE PRESENT UNSTABLE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN INDIA. ONLY
5 STATES HAVE LIBRARY LAWS, OPERATING WITH INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS. THE
LAWS ARE, HOWEVER, WEAK AND FINANCING OF LIBRARIES INADEQUATE. AT UNION LEVEL,
LIBRARY LEGISLATION WAS THE SUBJECT OF A COMMITTEE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD IN
1964, BUT WITH LACK OF INTEREST AMONG THE AUTHORITIES, NO ACTION HAS BEEN
TAKEN YET. IN THE MEANTIME, LIBRARIES FACE CHALLENGES FROM INCREASING NUMBERS
OF USERS, THE NEWLY LITERATE AND STUDENTS. THERE ARE MANY LIBRARY TYPES; APART
FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN CALCUTTA, THERE ARE STATE CENTRAL, DISTRICT,
BLOCK, VILLAGE, MOBILE, UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES OF
VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARIES ARE NUMEROUS. BUT THE NEED FOR
RESOURCES, AND PERHAPS A SUCCESSOR TO THE DYNAMIC S.R. RANGANATHAN, IS GREAT.
RESEARCH LIBRARIES AS REFLECTED IN THE GERMAN DAILY PRESS.
     
A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF REFERENCES TO RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE WEST GERMAN
DAILY PRESS REVEALS THAT ASPECTS OTHER THEN THE SUBSTANTIAL LIBRARY CONCERNS
DOMINATE. A GREATER INTEREST IN ISSUES DEALING WITH THE COLLECTION AND ITS
CONSERVATION CONSISTENTLY OVERSHADOWS PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE
LIBRARY. CORRESPONDING TO THIS ACCENTUATION AN UNCRITICAL SATISFACTION WITH
THE WORK OF ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES PREVAILS. IN ADDITION TO THE
SYSTEMATICAL SCOPE OF THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 326 NEWSPAPER ARTICLES
INVESTIGATED A SPECIFIC TEXT IS PRESENTED AND INTERPRETED.
AMERICAN EDUCATION LIBRARIES AND THE ACADEMIC STUDY/TRAINING DEBATE.
     
AS LATE AS 1899, NO MORE THAN 1/3 OF THE TEACHERS IN MASSACHUSETTS HAD BEEN
EXPOSED TO LIBRARY FACILITIES IN A NORMAL SCHOOL. DURING THE EARLY 20TH
CENTURY, A CHANGE TOOK PLACE WHICH AFFECTED TEACHER EDUCATION AS MUCH AS IT
DID OTHER DISCIPLINES. EDUCATION LIBRARY COLLECTIONS DEVELOPED, EDUCATION
LIBRARY SERVICES EXPANDED TO MEET A GROWING DEMAND. EDUCATION LIBRARIANS BEGAN
TO HOLD NATIONAL MEETINGS AND TO DEBATE QUESTIONS OF STANDARDS, BOTH
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE. THROUGHOUT ITS BRIEF HISTORY, EDUCATION
LIBRARIANSHIP SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BETWEEN THE PUSH FOR THE ACADEMIC
STUDY OF EDUCATION AND THE PULL FOR THE PRACTICAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS.

AMONG MEMBER LIBRARIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE, AND AN
INVITATION EXTENDED TO LATIN AMERICAN LIBRARIES IN THE FIELD TO SHARE THE
HUMAN AND INFORMATION RES OURCES THAT VMS PROVIDES.
ART LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS WORLDWIDE' THEIR HISTORY AND FUTURE.
     
(PAPER PRESENTED TO THE ART LIBRARIES SECTION AT THE IFLA CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG,
AUG 81.) THE WORLDWIDE COMPASS OF THE VISUAL ARTS AND THEIR PARALLEL
DOCUMENTATION BRINGS WITH IT THE NECESSITY FOR A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, COMMUNICATION AND ORGANISATION BETWEEN ART LIBRARIES.
THIS, AND THE PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO MATERIAL AND READERS, GIVES ART
LIBRARIANSHIP ITS DISTINCTION-ONE WHICH, WITHIN ART LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS AND
WITHIN IFLA, HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPED AND SHARED OVER THE YEARS. A
PARTICULAR DUTY OF THE ART LIBRARIAN NOW MUST BE TO HELP PRESERVE THE LOCAL
AND NATIONAL QUALITIES OF ART AND LIFE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
INTERNATIONAL SCENE.

PRESENTED AND RESOLUTIONS PASSED, AND THE CREATION OF VARIOUS NATIONAL
ASSOCIATIONS RECORDED. FINALLY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE
NEW SECTION, ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT AT ITS FOUNDATION, AND PROJECTS FOR THE
FUTURE.
THE JENA LITERARY MUSEUM 1816-1919.
     
THE MUSEUM WAS ADMINISTERED BY A GROUP OF MEMBERS WITH LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC
INTERESTS WHO WISHED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON POLITICAL AND TOPICAL MATTERS

FORESHADOWED A MODERN TREND. STOCKS WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH COOPERATIVE
AGREEMENTS WITH' THE GRAND DUKE'S LIBRARY IN WEIMAR; JENA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY,
FOR WHICH THE MUSEUM BECAME A READING-ROOM UNTIL 1915; THE WEIMAR BOOK MUSEUM;
THE CARL ZEISS FOUNDATION. MANY PRIVATE MEMBERS ALSO DONATED THEIR JOURNALS TO
THE MUSEUM. WHEN THE PUBLIC READING ROOM OPENED IN JENA IN 1896, REFLECTING
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL AND POLITICAL THOUGHT, IT FLOURISHED; THE MUSEUM,
IN CONTRAST, WISHED TO REMAIN THE PRESERVE OF A WELL-EDUCATED, FEE-PAYING
MINORITY AND THUS RESTRICTED ITS OWN DEVELOPMENT. ULTIMATELY THE MUSEUM BECAME
PART OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION (IN SWEDISH).
     
THE BLLD WAS FORMED IN 1973 THROUGH THE AMALGAMATION OF THE NATIONAL CENTRAL
LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE AIM
IS THAT ALMOST ALL ORDERS FROM OTHER LIBRARIES SHALL BE FULFILLED FROM THE
LIBRARY'S OWN STOCK AND PROCESSED THE SAME DAY. THIS NECESSITATES A
COMPREHENSIVE ACQUISITION POLICY, EFFICIENT WORK ROUTINES, AND CENTRAL
LOCATION, AT BOSTON SPA. ITS GIFT & EXCHANGE SECTION SERVES A USEFUL FUNCTION
AS DEPOSIT FOR WITHDRAWN MATERIAL FROM OTHER LIBRARIES. A MUSIC COLLECTION IS
BEING BUILT UP. THE LARGEST DEPARTMENTS ARE THOSE FOR SERIALS AND BOOKS, AND
TOTAL STOCK COMPRISES 4 MILLION VOLUMES AND 2.5 MILLION DOCUMENTS OR FICHES.
ALL PERIODICALS, BUT MAINLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE MONOGRAPHS ONLY, ARE ACQUIRED.
SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO COVERAGE OF RUSSIAN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
PUBLICATIONS. DESCRIBES THE SELECTION METHODS. THE ROUTINES ARE SIMPLE AND FEW
OF THE STAFF HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION, EMPHASIS BEI NG ON ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS.

BACK-UP LIBRARIES IS MADE, MOSTLY THE LEGAL DEPOSIT LIBRARIES. VARIOUS
CATALOGUES ARE AVAILABLE, INCLUDING THE UNION CATALOGUE OF BOOKS LISTING THE
HOLDINGS OF BLLD AND SOME OTHER LIBRARIES.
THE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN SOCIETY.
     
AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AN ANALYSIS OF FIRSTLY, THE NEED FOR AND FUNCTIONS
OF COMMUNICATION IN SOCIETY; SECONDLY, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE RECORD AS A MEANS
OF COMMUNICATION; AND THIRDLY, THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS AN AGENT OF
COMMUNICATION IN ACTIVATING THE RECORD, THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY ARE STATED AS THE ADVANCEMENT OF CULTURE, THE PROVISION OF USEFUL
INFORMATION, AND RECREATION. THEN THE QUESTION IS CONSIDERED WHETHER THE
PROVISION OF RECREATIONAL MATERIALS 2PER SE1 SHOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY AND WHETHER THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS NOT WEAKENING ITS POSITION IN
SOCIETY BY PROVIDING RECREATIONAL READING MATERIALS ON A LARGE SCALE, THUS
COMPETING WITH COMMERCIAL SOURCES OF RECREATION.

SERVICE IN WEST SUSSEX IN THE LIGHT OF BOTH CURRENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE
LEGISLATION; TO EXAMINE THE BALANCE OF THE SERVICE PROVIDED AND THE EFFECTS OF
INCREASING POPULATION IN THE COUNTY AND TO RECOMMEND A FUTURE STRATEGY, FOR
1981-1990, TO MEET THE PRIORITY NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN WEST SUSSEX WITHIN SUCH
FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AS MAY EXIST.

LATE 1980' THE THINKING TO BE DETECTED IN SUCCESSIVE DRAFTS OF RELEVANT
DOCUMENTS; THE DIMENSIONS OF BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO BE DEDUCED FROM
DATA OBTAINED; AND THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH A GIVEN AUTHORITY CAN DERIVE FROM THE
INFORMATION COLLECTED.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN FRANCE. ITS ACTUAL SITUATION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS.
     
A COMPREHENSIVE AND CRITICAL SURVEY ARGUING THE URGENT NEED TO PROVIDE EQUAL
LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR BOTH URBAN AND RURAL USERS. IN GENERAL, THE PUBLIC SEES
LIBRARIES AS OUT OF DATE, UNDER-RESOURCED, AND UNATTRACTIVE, AND IS LARGELY
UNAWARE OF RECENT NEW DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE THESE ARE RESTRICTED TO A FEW
CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE FREE COMPREHENSIVE
SERVICES FOR ALL' DESCRIBES THESE SERVICES IN DETAIL, AS THEY RELATE TO
DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION, AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. THE DIVISION OF
LIBRARY SERVICES INTO URBAN AND RURAL STRUCTURES HAS RESULTED IN INADEQUATE
SERVICES FOR COUNTRY AREAS; INSTEAD, THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE REORGANISED INTO A
NETWORK PATTERN TO EQUALISE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES. CRITICISMS OF MUNICIPAL
LIBRARIES, CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES, AND THE FRENCH PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN
GENERAL ARE SUMMARISED IN AN APPENDED MEMORANDUM, AND FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY
AN ANALYSIS OF THE ORGANISATION OF SERVICES IN THE CAMBRAI REGION.
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IN BULGARIAN LIBRARIES.
     
AFTER THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTION IN BULGARIA IN 1944, ALMOST 62% OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WERE ALLOCATED LARGER PREMISES. 5 OF THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES,
ESTABLISHED AS SUCH IN 1953, MOVED INTO NEW BUILDINGS, WHILE 2 OTHER BUILDINGS
WERE ERECTED FOR LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN SPITE OF THESE
IMPROVEMENTS, THERE IS STILL A CONSIDERABLE SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN LIBRARIES,
WHICH, IN GENERAL, ARE ALSO IN NEED OF MODERNISATION. REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT,
COMPUTER APPLICATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY MUST NOT ONLY ENSURE BETTER
LENDING SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERLENDING, BUT ALSO COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
RESOURCES AS WELL AS A WIDER DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. LIKE OTHER
COUNTRIES, MOBILE LIBRARIES SHOULD CATER FOR HAMLETS AND SMALL COMMUNITIES OF
SOME 1,000 INHABITANTS, AND ALSO FOR URBAN POPULATIONS LIVING ON NEW HOUSING
ESTATES AND/OR IN OTHER AREAS TEMPORARILY WITHOUT LIBRARIES. PURPOSE-BUILT
BUILDINGS SHOULD BE ENVISAGED FOR E VERY LIBRARY WITH 70,000 AND MORE VOLUMES.
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES, BOTH ON A NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL, SHOULD ALSO BE
PLANNED TO STORE VALUABLE BOOKS AND RARELY REQUESTED BOOKS.

OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN CUBA SINCE 1959. THE MAJOR
ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS PERIOD WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
NETWORK WITH THE NATIONAL LIBRARY JOSE MARTI AT THE HEAD. THE FUNCTION OF
LIBRARIES HAS CHANGED FROM MERE COLLECTIONS OF BOOKS TO LIVING INSTITUTIONS
TAKING PART IN THE NATIONAL CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. PUBLIC
LIBRARIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LITERACY CAMPAIGN. EXTENSION
ACTIVITIES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR WORK ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES. STATISTICAL DATA ILLUSTRATE LIBRARY PROVISION IN THE PAST 20 YEARS.

DESCRIBES DELHI PUBLIC LIBRARY, OPENED IN 1951. BORROWING IS FREE, ALTHOUGH
THERE IS AN INITIAL DEPOSIT TOO HIGH FOR MANY PEOPLE. THE LIBRARY RUNS 4
REGIONAL LIBRARIES WITH 20 BRANCH LIBRARIES, EVENTUALLY TO BE SELF-GOVERNING.
IT ALSO HAS DEPOSIT COLLECTIONS IN 3 HOSPITALS, THE PRISON, AND INSTITUTIONS
FOR THE BLIND, USING THE LIBRARY'S OWN BRAILLE BOOKS. MATERIALS HAVE TO BE IN
MANY LANGUAGES, WITH HINDI, URDU, PUNJABI AND ENGLISH THE MOST COMMON. THERE
IS AN ADULT LENDING SECTION, READING ROOM, REFERENCE SECTION, AND CHILDREN'S
SECTION; THE LATTER IS, HOWEVER, GIVEN LOW PRIORITY. THE LIBRARY ARRANGES FREE
ACTIVITIES FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, SUCH AS FILMS, BOOK-TALKS, AUTHOR
WORK-SHOPS, AND ORGANISES STUDY GROUPS. THE BOOK SELECTION PROCEDURES ARE
SOMEWHAT HAPHAZARD; STRESS IS ON INDIAN AND WESTERN CLASSICS. SOME POPULAR
SCIENTIFIC WORKS ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN HINDI. DELHI PUBLIC LIBRARY APPEARS A
TRADITIONAL WESTERN LIBRARY SERVICE, WITH LITTLE ATTEMPT TO CATER FOR THE MASS
OF ILLITERATE AND POTENTIAL USERS.

PALESTINE, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE SHA'AR ZION LIBRARY IN JAFFA AND TEL-AVIV (IN
HEBREW).

PUBLIC LIBRARY AS FORMULATED BY ITS FOUNDERS, LIBRARIANS AND THE TOWN FATHERS
DURING THE PERIOD OF THE 1ST 4 WAVES OF ZIONIST IMMIGRATION, FROM THE 1880S TO
1931. THE EMPHASIS IS ON ANALYSIS OF THE CLASH BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF THE
POPULAR PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO SERVE PREDOMINANTLY THE
IMMEDIATE AND TOPICAL NEEDS OF THE IMMIGRANTS AND HELP IN THEIR ABSORPTION,
AND THE CONCEPT OF THE SCHOLARLY PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH EMPHASISES THE
PROVISION OF SERVICES TO A LIMITED CLIENTELE OF SCHOLARS, WRITERS AND TEACHERS
IN THE FIELD OF JEWISH STUDIES. OPENS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE SOCIAL
BACKGROUND OF THE PERIOD. THE 2ND PART DEALS WITH THE ORIGINS OF THE SHA'AR
ZION LIBRARY AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE B'NAI
BRITH AND  B'NAI MOSHE ORDERS TOWARDS THE FORMULATION OF ITS MISSION. THE 3RD
AND 4TH SECTIONS ANALYSE THE DELIBERATIONS AND CONTENTIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE
TOWN COUNCIL AND OF ADVISORS WITH REGARD TO LIBRARY OBJECTIVES DURING THE
PERIOD OF THE 3RD AND 4TH WAVES OF IMMIGRATION (1919-31). IN THE LAST SECTION,
ATTEMPTS TO DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN PALESTINE IN THE PROCESS OF REALISATION OF ZIONIST IDEOLOGY,
ESPECIALLY ITS FUNCTION AS AN AGENCY FOR EDUCATING THE POPULACE IN THE SPIRIT
OF THAT IDEOLOGY, AND IN REALISING THE IDEAL OF THE CREATION OF A NEW JEWISH
SOCIETY IN PALESTINE WHICH WOULD PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN ITS CULTURAL EXCELLENCE
AND SUPREMACY.

DESCRIBES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE CAPE TOWN REGION OF SOUTH AFRICA
WITH CONSIDERATIONS OF THE 13 INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AND BRIEF DETAILS OF THE 12
DEPOTS.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND ITS SERVICES.
     
DISCUSSES VARIOUS LIBRARY SERVICES GENERALLY AVAILABLE AT THE UNIVERSITY
LEVEL. HIGHLIGHTS THE RELEVANCE AND UTILITY OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION
SERVICES THAT WERE REGARDED AS THE FEATURES OF SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. IT
POINTS OUT THE ADVANTAGES OF SUPPORTING SERVICES, SUCH AS REPROGRAPHY AND
TRANSLATION SERVICES IN THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SET-UP AND ALSO STRESSES THE
NEED FOR, AND IMPORTANCE OF EXTENSION SERVICE AS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY.
OSLO AND ITS MOST IMPORTANT LIBRARIES.
     
OSLO, WITH 456,000 INHABITANTS, ENJOYS A PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE FROM 2 MAIN
CENTRES-THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (UBO) AND THE DEICHMANSKE BIBLIOTEKET. THE UBO
SERVES BOTH AS A UNIVERSITY AND NATIONAL LIBRARY, THEREBY CREATING A SERIES OF
DIFFICULTIES IN THE STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF THE SERVICE. BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK
HAS BEEN FACILITATED BY THE USE OF COMPUTERS, AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE IN PROCESS. THE PUBLIC HAS A SINGLE ALPHABETICAL AUTHOR AND
SUBJECT CATALOGUE, AND BUREAUCRATIC FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A
MINIMUM. THE DEICHMANSKE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARIES BY
ITS WIDESPREAD SERVICE TO SCHOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES. IT AIMS TO
PROCURE AND LEND BOOKS UNOBTAINABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. BOTH LIBRARIES LEAVE
THE IMPRESSION OF AN EFFICIENT SERVICE WHICH HAS ELIMINATED ALL SOURCES OF
DISCOURAGEMENT TO USERS.
APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES FOR THE 12TH PARTY CONGRESS IN THE LIBRARY OF
THE KOSSUTH LAJOS UNIVERSITY IN DEBRECEN.
     
THESE GUIDELINES ENCOURAGE THE STAFF AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE LIBRARY TO
STRENGTHEN THE POLITICAL COMMITMENT OF THEIR ACTIVITY, INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY,
EFFECTIVENESS AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS TO ATTACH MORE IMPORTANCE TO
INFORMATION SERVICES.
UNB LIBRARY NEARS 200 YEARS.
     
A HISTORY OF THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK AND ITS
PREDECESSORS, CONCENTRATING ON THE EARLY YEARS FROM THE LATE 18TH CENTURY AND
19TH CENTURY. THE BONAR LAW-BENNET LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN 1931 AND ENLARGED IN
1950-51. IN 1967 THE NEW HARRIET IRVING LIBRARY OPENED AND THE BONAR
LAW-BENNET BUILDING BECAME THE PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES.
A MEDICAL LIBRARY SERVICE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION-LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.) THE UNIVERSITY OF
PAPUA NEW GUINEA MEDICAL LIBRARY IS DESCRIBED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRIORITIES
AND INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ASPECTS OF DEVELOPING A
NATIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY SERVICE ARE DISCUSSED.
COLLEGE LIBRARIANS AND THE NEW TRAINING INITIATIVE.
     
COLLEGES OF FURTHER EDUCATION WILL BE INVOLVED IN A PERIOD OF CURRICULUM
PLANNING PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED YOUTH TRAINING
SCHEME IN SEPTEMBER 1983. YTS COURSES WILL INCLUDE A 'BASIC SKILLS' COMPONENT
INTO WHICH 'INFORMATION SKILLS' WORK CAN BE INCORPORATED. THE FURTHER
EDUCATION UNIT REPORT 2A BASIS FOR CHOICE 1CAN BE USED TO INDICATE POINTS AT
WHICH COLLEGE LIBRARIANS MIGHT MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION TO YTS CURRICULUM
PLANNING.
GUIDELINES FOR LEARNING RESOURCES CENTER DEVELOPMENT IN TRADITIONALLY BLACK
FOUR-YEAR STATE-SUPPORTED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.
     
(PHD DISSERTATION-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) INVESTIGATION INTO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES FOR LEARNING RESOURCE CENTRES, BASED ON A STUDY OF
SELECTED CENTRES IN TRADITIONALLY BLACK 4-YEAR STATE-SUPPORTED COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES, 1972-77. ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH TITLE III,
ADVANCED INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (AIDP) FUNDING IS USED TO EFFECT
MODIFICATION OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES SO THAT THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE
LEARNING RESOURCES CENTRES AND TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES WHICH WOULD BE USEFUL IN
DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEARNING RESOURCES CENTRE DEVELOPMENT IN
TRADITIONALLY BLACK 4-YEAR STATE-SUPPORTED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

ABSTRACT.
COLLEGES OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES' THREE VIEWS.
     
DESCRIBES BRIEFLY THE REORGANISATION OF TEACHER TRAINING WHICH TOOK PLACE IN
THE UK DURING THE 1970S, AND DISCUSSES ITS EFFECTS ON COLLEGE LIBRARIES.
CONSIDERS SOME ASPECTS OF RECENT LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN THE NEW COLLEGES OF
HIGHER EDUCATION, INCLUDING THE GROWTH OF MULTI MEDIA SERVICES, AND THE
GROUPING OF ALL LEARNING RESOURCES INTO ONE DEPARTMENT. OUTLINES THE SERVICES
AND FACILITIES PROVIDED BY THE LEARNING RESOURCE CENTRES OF AMERICAN COMMUNITY
COLLEGES, WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED, CAN BE COMPARED TO BRITISH COLLEGES OF
FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION. ARGUES THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT FOR
COLLEGES OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT SO CHOOSE, TO FOLLOW THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY
COLLEGES IN THEIR INVESTMENT IN LEARNING RESOURCES FOR GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL
STUDY.
THE MEDIA CENTRE IN A VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL.
     
STUDENTS IN A VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL WILL INCLUDE FORMER PUPILS OF BOTH
GRAMMAR AND SECONDARY MODERN SCHOOLS. SOME STUDENTS WILL BE ON PART TIME, SOME
ON FULL TIME COURSES; MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE HAD SOME WORK EXPERIENCE AND MANY
WILL HAVE PRACTICAL RATHER THAN ACADEMIC ABILITY. THE MEDIA CENTRE NEEDS A
WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECT MATERIAL FOR ALL ACADEMIC LEVELS. SELF-TEACHING
PROGRAMMES ARE VERY IMPORTANT; AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA ARE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN
DEMONSTRATING THE OPERATION OF MACHINERY. SOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE LEARNING
DIFFICULTIES AND A LACK OF MOTIVATION; PROVISION OF MATERIAL FOR LEISURE AS
WELL AS ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE THE LIBRARY, WHERE
THEY MAY FIND THEIR LAST CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOR EDUCATIONAL DEFICITS. THE MEDIA
CENTRE SHOULD ALSO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF JOB FLEXIBILITY.
PERSPECTIVES ON ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES IN THE 1980S' INDICATORS
FROM A DELPHI STUDY.
     
A DELPHI STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE CHANGES IN LIBRARY ROLES AND
FUNCTIONS THAT THE DIRECTORS OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES BELIEVE
WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE METHODOLOGY IS DESCRIBED AND THE RESULTS
ARE SUMMARISED. 2 SCENARIOS RESULTED' ONE HIGHLY DESIRABLE; THE OTHER, HIGHLY
PROBABLE, AND THEY OVERLAP BY 64%. LIBRARY DIRECTORS EXPECT MODERATE
EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. USERS ARE PERCEIVED TO BE THE FORCE
MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO, WHILE TECHNOLOGY IS THE FORCE ADVANCING CHANGE.
THE ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS SEEN AS DESIRABLE AND WITHIN THE LIBRARIES' SPAN
OF CONTROL. EDUCATION AND SERVICE ROLES OF LIBRARIANS WILL EXPAND. LIBRARY AND
INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITIES ARE SEEN AS OBSTACLES TO CHANGE.
VETERINARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA 1977/78.
     
DATA ON 7 ASPECTS OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE PRESENTED AND
DISCUSSED' DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON THE SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE THE
LIBRARIES SUPPORT, NUMBER OF BOUND VOLUMES HELD AND NUMBER OF SERIAL TITLES
RECEIVED, AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS, STAFFING LEVELS AND SALARIES, MATERIALS
BUDGETS, PHYSICAL SIZE AND ACCESS TO COMPUTERISED BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES.
THE GREAT VARIABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN COLLECTION SIZE IS STRESSED AND
ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH FACTORS AS SIZE AND PROGRAMMES OF THE VETERINARY SCHOOL,
AGE OF THE SCHOOL AND LIBRARY, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, ACCESSIBILITY OF OTHER
LIBRARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE AND EXCHANGE PROGRAMMES.
SNI-FINLAND'S INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
     
DESCRIBES SUOMEN NUORISOKIRJALLISUUDEN INSTITUUTTI, THE FINNISH INSTITUTE FOR
LITERATURE FOR THE YOUNG. IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1978 IN TAMPERE, HAS A BOARD OF 15
WITH A CHAIRMAN, AND ADMITS INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANISATIONS AS MEMBERS. IT
COLLECTS ALL FINNISH BOOKS AND JOURNALS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND
TRANSLATIONS FROM FINNISH, AND THE LIBRARY COMPRISES TODAY 15,000 BOOKS AND
100 JOURNALS. NEW PUBLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED AS DONATIONS FROM HELSINGFORS
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND OTHERS. THE INSTITUTE SUPPORTS RESEARCH, HAS CONTACT
WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS,
AND UNDERTAKES PUBLISHING. A PROJECT TO RESEARCH THE HISTORY OF FINLAND'S
LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AWAITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. SNI
ORGANISES RESEARCH MEETINGS, EXHIBITIONS, AND CONFERENCES. AS FROM 1980, THE
INSTITUTE HAS BEEN RECEIVING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE AS WELL AS FROM
TAMPERE TOWN COUNCIL.
LIBRARIES AFTER THE 10TH PARTY CONFERENCE.
     
A DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR TRADES UNION LIBRARIES IN 1981 WAS DRAWN UP TO FURTHER
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS; THE PLAN'S EFFECT ON THE LIBRARY IN VEB
KOMBINAT NARVA, AN EAST BERLIN ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB FACTORY IS DESCRIBED. CLOSE
COOPERATION IS ADVOCATED WITH THE COLLECTIVES AND WITH OTHER CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS AND THE EXPANSION OF STOCKS AND INFORMATION SERVICES. STUDENTS
AT THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING SCHOOL WERE TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE LIBRARY
SERVICES AT THE START OF THEIR COURSES AND SUITABLE LITERATURE PROVIDED FOR
INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL STUDIES AND FOR LEISURE ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT
SEVERAL APPRENTICE CLASSES MADE VISITS TO THE LIBRARY AND MORE LITERARY EVENTS
AND DISPLAYS WERE ORGANISED. IT IS HOPED THAT 1981 LOANS WILL INCREASE TO
75,000 AND THAT AT LEAST 55% OF WORKERS UNDER 25 WILL BE REGISTERED LIBRARY
MEMBERS.
THE SUPPORT OF ADULT EDUCATION AND TRAINING.
     
THE ARRIVAL OF NEW PLANT AT THE PETROCHEMICAL COMBINE AT SCHWEDT MEANT THAT
RETRAINING FOR SOME STAFF AND MORE ADVANCED TRAINING FOR OTHERS HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT. THE TRADE UNION LIBRARY AT THE WORKS HAD TO PARTICIPATE BY
ACQUIRING MULTIPLE COPIES AND CLASS SETS OF SOME BOOKS AND DISCARDING OUTDATED
MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY OBTAINED TEXTBOOKS REQUESTED BY THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
SCHOOL, CHECKING AVAILABLE MATERIAL AND FILLING IN GAPS IN SUBJECT COVERAGE.
ALL STUDENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH LEAFLETS DESCRIBING LIBRARY FACILITIES. AS A
RESULT LOANS IN 1980 TOTALLED 42,400, COMPARED WITH 35,065 FOR 1979. SIMILAR
ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE LIBRARY TO PROVIDE THE MATERIAL NEEDED FOR
POLITICAL EDUCATION.
INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES.
     
EXTRACT FROM A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE FIJI LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AT THE 'MINI
CONVENTION', WESTERN REGIONAL LIBRARY, LAUTOKA, FIJI, 29 NOV 80. DISCUSSES THE
VALUE AND PURPOSES OF INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS
FIJI WHERE SPECIALISED INFORMATION AND RESEARCH ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE.
DESCRIBES THE TRAINING CENTRE RESEARCH LIBRARY OF THE FIJI ELECTRICITY
AUTHORITY.
THE DEVELOPMENT AND WORK OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
PATIENTS, AS BASED ON THE REGULATIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN THE GERMAN
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
     
LIBRARY WORK IS COORDINATED BY DISTRICT WORKING PARTIES, WITH SPECIAL GROUPS
SUPERVISING PATIENTS' LIBRARIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS WHERE BIBLIOTHERAPY
PLAYS A PROMINENT PART. CLOSE LINKS ARE MAINTAINED WITH DISTRICT MEDICAL
OFFICERS. SOME HOSPITALS ARE STILL WITHOUT PATIENTS' LIBRARIES AND EVERY
EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEDICAL
STAFF. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SELECT STOCK THAT WILL ASSIST RECOVERY; REGULAR
DISCUSSIONS ARE HELD ON SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ARRANGEMENT AND APPEARANCE OF
PATIENTS' LIBRARIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT; OLD HOSPITAL BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN
WITHOUT SUITABLE PREMISES FOR A LIBRARY. IN NEW BUILDINGS A LIBRARY ROOM IS
ALWAYS PROVIDED. IN MANY HOSPITALS THE PATIENTS' LIBRARY IS AMALGAMATED WITH
THE TRADE UNION LIBRARY, SO THAT EXTRA FINANCE AND STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.
THE LIBRARY SERVICE IN PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN KENT.
     
A DETAILED SURVEY OF THE LIBRARIES OF H.M. PRISON MAIDSTONE AND H.M. PRISON
STANDFORD HILL WITH SURVEYS OF SERVICES IN 7 OTHER PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN
KENT, UK.
LIBRARIES AND THE PHYSICALLY DISABLED.
     
THE CELEBRATION OF THE YEAR 1981 AS THE 'YEAR FOR THE DISABLED PERSONS' WAS A
PART OF THE GENERAL PROGRAMME OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO AMELIORATE THE
CONDITION OF HANDICAPPED PERSONS. LIBRARIES CAN EDUCATE AND PROVIDE RECREATION
TO THE PHYSICALLY DISABLED.
LIBRARIES AND THE UN'S INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED.
     
LIBRARIES HAVE A SPECIAL ROLE IN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS WHICH PREVENT
HANDICAPPED READERS GAINING ACCESS TO PRINTED MATERIAL. ARGUES THAT MOST OF
THE 50% IN DENMARK WHO ARE NOT LIBRARY USERS ARE MORE OR LESS HANDICAPPED.
SOME ARE HANDICAPPED FROM PHYSICAL CAUSES, AND OTHERS ARE SLOW OR NEW READERS
AND DYSLEXICS. DESCRIBES THE IMPORTANCE OF READING IN DAILY LIFE AND THE
REASONS FOR LACK OF SKILL IN READING. OUTLINES RULES FOR LANGUAGE AND LAY-OUT
WHICH MAKE A BOOK EASIER TO READ AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOK AIMED AT
DIFFERENT GROUPS ('ORDINARY' BOOKS, EASY READERS, MAGNAPRINT, BRAILLE, SPOKEN
BOOKS, BOOK 0 TAPE). THIS KIND OF MATERIAL IS GIVEN TOO LITTLE PRIORITY BY
PUBLISHERS AND LIBRARIES. SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN DESIGN OF LIBRARIES
TO MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE TO THE HANDICAPPED. THE LIBRARY MUST DISSEMINATE ITS
SERVICES WIDELY TO THE HANDICAPPED. DURING THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT LIBRARIES MAKE A SPECIAL  EFFORT AND ARE REPRESENTED ON LOCAL
ORGANISING COMMITTEES.
IYDP 1981: WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS?.
     
CHANGES IN LIBRARY SERVICES ARE BEING DEMANDED IN REFERENCE TO THE DISABLED
CLIENT. DESCRIBES FORMS OF DISABILITIES AND MAKES SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW
SERVICE TO DISABLED CLIENTS CAN BE IMPROVED. SPECIAL MENTION IS MADE OF THE
NEED FOR ATTENTION TO THIS AREA IN LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMMES.
CONSIDERING THE DISABLED IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES' ATTITUDES AND LIBRARY DESIGN.
     
WITH THE INTRODUCTION AND INCREASING PREVALENCE OF MAINSTREAMING IN SCHOOLS,
IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO COPE WITH SOME DEGREE OF
DISABILITY. DISABILITIES VARY TREMENDOUSLY, BOTH IN TYPE AND DEGREE TO WHICH
NORMAL FUNCTIONING IS IMPAIRED. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL STUDENTS BE GIVEN THE
SAME CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.
LIBRARIANS CAN CONTRIBUTE MOST BY UNDERSTANDING THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES AND
NEEDS OF THE CHILD. ABILITIES RATHER THAN DISABILITIES NEED TO BE EMPHASISED.
BESIDES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BARRIERS, THE PROBLEM OF SIMPLE PHYSICAL
ACCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED. DESIGN FEATURES THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED INCLUDE
ACCESS TO THE BUILDING, ACCESS WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND ACCESS TO ALL LIBRARY
SERVICES.
LIBRARY SERVICES TO PHYSICALLY DISABLED PERSONS.
     
THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED PERSONS 1981 HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION TO
THE 8% OF THE WORLD POPULATION WHO ARE DISABLED IN SOME WAY. CONSIDERABLE
ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF THESE PEOPLE. IN ORDER TO
OFFER THEM EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AS ABLE PERSONS IN THE
LIBRARY, SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PHYSICAL LAY-OUT AND EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED. BLIND PERSONS HAVE A WELL-COORDINATED SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARY
SERVICE WITH BOOKS IN BRAILLE OR MOON PRINT AND BOOKS ON TAPE AT THEIR
DISPOSAL. ALMOST ALL OTHER DISABLED PERSONS CAN RELY WITH CONFIDENCE ON THE
SERVICE OF THEIR NEARBY LIBRARY. SPECIAL ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO SUPPLY THEM
WITH BOOKS, IN GENERAL AS WELL AS AIMED AT THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. E.G. HOW TO
ADAPT TO THEIR WAY OF LIVING AS DISABLED PERSONS (DEALING WITH THE PRACTICAL
ASPECTS LIKE CLOTHING AND HOUSING) AND HOW TO ACCEPT REALITY (HEALING OF THE
MIND).
A NATIONAL GUIDE TO LIBRARIES FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN BRAZIL.
     
THE GUIDE, COMPILED BY A WORKING PARTY SET UP BY THE BRAZILIAN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION, IS PRESENTED IN FULL, WITH A BRIEF INTRODUCTION BY THE
COORDINATOR OF THE GROUP. THE LIBRARIES ARE LISTED BY REGION; UNDER EACH ENTRY
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE PARENT INSTITUTION, COLLECTIONS, AND SERVICES.
ALPHABETICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL INDEXES ARE SUPPLIED.
LITERATURE FOR THE BLIND AND FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGHT PROBLEMS: THE PUBLISHING
PROGRAMME OF THE GERMAN CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND.
     
THE GERMAN CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND (DEUTSCHE ZENTRALBUCHEREI FUR BLINDE)
WAS OPENED IN LEIPZIG IN 1894, THE 1ST LIBRARY OF ITS KIND IN GERMANY. CURRENT
STOCKS OF BRAILLE WORKS TOTAL 7,700, COMPRISING 26,700 VOLUMES, SINCE WORKS IN
BRAILLE REQUIRE MORE VOLUMES THAN NORMAL PRINT BOOKS. BOOKS INCLUDE FICTION
AND NON-FICTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND LITERATURE IS ALSO PROVIDED ON
TAPES (67,000), CASSETTES (25,000) AND RECORDS. SOUND RECORDINGS ARE
PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR THE ELDERLY, WHO FIND IT HARD TO LEARN BRAILLE. MOST
CONTACTS WITH READERS ARE MADE BY POST OR TELEPHONE, BUT THERE IS A PUBLIC
READING ROOM WITH CATALOGUES IN NORMAL PRINT AND BRAILLE. THE LIBRARY HAS
STAFF AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BRAILLE BOOKS, TALKING BOOKS AND THE
REPRODUCTION OF TAPES AND CASSETTES. A LIST OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF LARGE
PRINT BOOKS IS INCLUDED.
THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (PART) II.
     
PART I OF THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN 2BIBLIOTEKSBLADET1 66 (6) 1981 (+S+E+E
82/573). THE PUBLISHING OF THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (TPB) IS
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE SUPPLY OF TALKING BOOKS. 1200 TITLES ANNUALLY ARE
PRODUCED FOR LOAN IN LIBRARIES, OF WHICH THE TPB ACCOUNTS FOR 900. THE
SELECTION OF BOOKS INCLUDES ALL EASY READERS AND 25% OF PRODUCTION ARE BOOKS
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. THE AGED FORM THE LARGEST USER GROUP. BRAILLE
BOOKS ARE NOW IN A MINORITY; THEY ARE LENT DIRECTLY TO READERS. CATALOGUES OF
THE TPB'S STOCK AND NEW ACQUISITIONS ARE BEING PREPARED USING THE BUMS DATA
BASE. SOME BOOKS FOR IMMIGRANTS ARE AVAILABLE. AS A LOAN CENTRE THE TPB IS
OBLIGED TO LEND TO DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND COLLATE INFORMATION ON LOCAL
LIBRARY STOCKS. IT AIMS TO DEVELOP THE DECENTRALISATION OF TALKING BOOK
PROVISION AND THEREFORE WISHES TO TRANSFER TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIRECT LENDING TO INDIVIDUALS AND PURCHASE OF AN ADEQUATE
STOCK FROM THE LIBRARY SERVICE.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO HEARING IMPAIRED CHILDREN.
     
DESCRIBES HEARING IMPAIRMENT AND THE RESULTING MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR THE HEARING
IMPAIRED CHILD. UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS AND THEIR EFFECTS AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION ARE OUTLINED. THE PROGRAMME OFFERED AT THE
GLENDONALD SCHOOL FOR DEAF CHILDREN IS DESCRIBED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO
LIBRARY SERVICE.
MORE ATTENTION TO SENIOR READERS.
     
1982 BEING PROCLAIMED BY UNESCO AS THE YEAR OF AGE CONCERN, A THOUGHT SHOULD
BE GIVEN TO SENIOR READERS. THERE ARE OVER 2,400,000 POTENTIAL READERS IN
CZECHOSLOVAKIA WHO ARE OVER 60 AND THEIR NUMBER IS LIKELY TO INCREASE IN
FUTURE. THIS, 1ST PART OF A SERIES ON THIS THEME, IS LOOKING AT OLD AGE AS A
NATURAL PROCESS AND RECOUNTS CARE AFFORDED TO SENIOR CITIZENS IN
CZECHOSLOVAKIA.
VISITING LIBRARY SERVICES' A SURVEY OF ONTARIO'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
PRESENTS RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF ONTARIO PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO THE PROVISION OF
VISITING LIBRARY SERVICES TO OLD PEOPLES' APARTMENT BUILDINGS, NURSING HOMES
AND HOSPITALS STAFFED BY VOLUNTEER STAFF AND VOLUNTEER/PROFESSIONAL STAFF.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND AN AGEING POPULATION.
     
THE ROLE OF CANADIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OLD
PEOPLE IS REVIEWED.
LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
REPORT ON THE IFLA/UNESCO SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON
LIBRARY WORK FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE, LEIPZIG, AUG 81. THE BASIC THEME
WAS DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN
AMERICA, WHERE MANY CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL ONLY BRIEFLY OR NOT AT ALL, SO THEY
REMAIN ILLITERATE. MANY PARENTS ARE ALSO ILLITERATE SO READING IN LEISURE
HOURS IS NOT ENCOURAGED. WHAT SCHOOL BOOKS AND LESSONS THERE ARE EXIST ONLY IN
AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, GENERALLY THAT OF A COLONISING POWER. THERE IS A LACK OF
PUBLISHED MATERIAL IN LOCAL LANGUAGES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER EVEN BEEN
WRITTEN DOWN. IN THESE COUNTRIES A LIBRARY NETWORK MUST BE ESTABLISHED AND THE
GROWTH OF READING ENCOURAGED WITH THE HELP OF PROFESSIONAL AND VOLUNTARY
STAFF. LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE HANDICAPPED POSE SPECIAL PROBLEMS.
THE PRE-SESSION SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, LEIPZIG,
DDR, 10-15 AUGUST 1981.
     
THE UNESCO/IFLA PRE-SESSION SEMINAR FOR EXPERTS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WAS
DEVOTED TO LIBRARY WORK FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. THE PRINCIPLES FOR THE
ORGANISATION OF THE SEMINAR ARE LISTED.
THE PRESENT SITUATION OF LIBRARIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN BRAZIL.
     
A BRIEF HISTORICAL SKETCH IS GIVEN OF THE EVOLUTION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES IN
BRAZIL; NUMBERS ARE STILL SMALL BUT PLANS TO AROUSE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT
INTEREST ARE IN HAND. EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY, IN
PREPARING THE CHILD FOR THE ADULT WORLD AND DEVELOPING THE READING HABIT;
DESCRIBES THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MEDIA TO BE MADE AVAILABLE; CONSIDERS THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY; AND DISCUSSES
VARIOUS EXTENSION ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE
AREA OF THE LIBRARY. EMPHASISES THE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LIBRARIES
AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES ALREADY IN OPERATION.
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES IN MALI' PROBLEMS AND DEVELOPMENT.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE IFLA/UNESCO SEMINAR IN LEIPZIG, AUG 81. IN PRE-COLONIAL
TIMES EDUCATION IN MALI WAS PROVIDED WITHIN THE FAMILY; IN THE COLONIAL
PERIODS, THE MEDIAEVAL BERBERS AND 19TH CENTURY FRENCH ESTABLISHED SOME
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. BETWEEN 1960 AND 1980, AFTER INDEPENDENCE, THE
EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS REFORMED AND A LITERACY CAMPAIGN PROMOTED IN THE
COUNTRY'S 4 MAIN LANGUAGES. SINCE THE 1970S 46 PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN
OPENED, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT. KEYPOINTS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES ARE THE PRODUCTION OF SUITABLE LITERATURE,
STOCK EXPANSION AND STAFF TRAINING, A PROGRAMME COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BAMAKO. LIBRARIANS, AUTHORS AND
PUBLISHERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL LEGENDS AND
STORIES, ORGANISE CULTURAL EVENTS AND ENCOURAGE LIBRARY USE.
TWO NOTABLE EXPERIMENTS IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES: CLAMART, FRANCE AND SAO
PAULO, BRAZIL.
     
FOLLOWING A VISIT TO THE CLAMART 'JOY THROUGH BOOKS' PROJECT IN 1979, THE
LIBRARIAN IN CHARGE OF THE SAO PAULO CHILDREN'S LIBRARY NETWORK COMMENTS ON
THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE 2 SCHEMES, BOTH DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR
RESPECTIVE USERS PLACES WHERE CHILDREN CAN LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD AND BECOME
AWARE OF THE VALUE OF BOOKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE ORGANISATION AND
OPERATION OF THE 2 SCHEMES, WHERE CONVENTIONAL LIBRARY PRACTICES HAVE BEEN
REPLACED BY MORE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE IFLA/UNESCO SEMINAR IN LEIPZIG, AUG 81. GENERAL
CONDITIONS ARE ILLUSTRATED BY A DESCRIPTION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES IN BENDEL
PROVINCE, WHERE CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE THE 1970S. REFERENCE DEPARTMENTS IN
LARGE LIBRARIES ALSO STOCK SOME MATERIAL FOR CHILDREN. LIBRARY STAFF ORGANISE
READING SESSIONS, FILMS, DANCING AND ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES AND HOPE TO DEVELOP
THESE FURTHER AND TO EXPAND READERSHIP. BENDEL'S SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE IS
ADMINISTERED BY A CENTRE IN CHARGE OF ALL PURCHASING AND LOANS. SHORT TRAINING
COURSES ARE ORGANISED FOR TEACHER-LIBRARIANS AND PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSISTANTS
ALSO HELP IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC/SCHOOLS LIBRARY SYSTEM FOR MALTA.
     
(FLA THESIS.) PROVIDES A PLAN TO STANDARDISE DEVELOPMENT IN THE
STATE-CONTROLLED PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN MALTA, OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD,
IN LIGHT OF THE FAILURE OF THE 7-YEAR MALTA DEVELOPMENT PLAN TO MENTION
LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. STRESSES THE FACT THAT MALTA HAS A SUFFICIENTLY WELL
EDUCATED AND APPRECIATIVE POPULATION TO EMBARK ON SUCH A PROGRAMME OF
INTEGRATED SERVICE AND PROVISION.
SCHOOL LIBRARIES-A DREAM OF THE 1970S.
     
EDUCATIONAL REFORM CANNOT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF THE BASIC
CULTURAL TECHNOLOGY. PARTICULAR SUCCESS IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE 3
COMBINED SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN HANOVER, WHICH CONTAINS A WIDE RANGE
OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT FOR CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL STUDY AND FOR LEISURE
ACTIVITIES. IF PURCHASING, PROCESSING AND CONTROL OF SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
STOCKS ARE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO CENTRALISED PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THE
RIGHT TO FINANCIAL PROVISION MUST BE GUARANTEED. MORE CLARITY IS NEEDED
REGARDING THE CALCULATION OF PROCESSING COSTS; STAFFING COSTS SHOULD BE BORNE
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MATERIAL AND BINDING COSTS BY THE SCHOOLS. SOME PROBLEMS
CONCERNING THE ORGANISATION OF USE PROCEDURES, E.G. TICKET WRITING AND FINE
COLLECTION, REMAIN UNSOLVED.
THE MINISTER HAS BEEN LED ASTRAY.
     
THE CONTRIBUTION BY A MEMBER OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE TO A DEBATE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HELD AT THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING, OCT 81. ARGUES THAT THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN
ITS LIBRARY BILL HAS DISREGARDED THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS FOR SCHOOL
LIBRARIES. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH LIBRARIES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1964 LIBRARY
ACT, A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITH THE INCLUSION OF SCHOOL
LIBRARIES. THE IDEAL OF UNITY IS NOW BEING SET ASIDE. BUT IF THE SCHOOL
LIBRARIES ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS, THE MINIMUM DEMAND TO ENSURE
THEIR EXISTENCE MUST BE BY-LAWS GOVERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AND A SEPARATE BUDGET. THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE CONFIRMED BY THE
MINISTER OF CULTURE. YET THE LIBRARY BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF THEM AND REDUCES
THE SEPARATE BUDGET TO AN ACCOUNTING ITEM IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FINANCES. THE
BILL IS, THEREFORE, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE DANISH LI BRARY ASSOCIATION.
SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN LOWER SAXONY.
     
LECTURE GIVEN TO THE CONFERENCE OF LIBRARIANS IN LOWER SAXONY, CELLE, APR 81.
SINCE 1979 THE SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRE IN HANOVER HAS PROVIDED CENTRALISED
PURCHASING, PROCESSING AND ADVISORY SERVICES FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN ITS
AREA. THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RUN BY LIBRARIANS
OR TEACHERS IS STILL DISPUTED. SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN'
THE REFORMED GRAMMAR SCHOOL, WHERE THEY PROMOTE INDEPENDENT STUDY AND
COOPERATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PUPILS; SCHOOLS OPEN ALL DAY, WHERE THE
LIBRARY BECOMES A COMMUNICATION CENTRE CATERING FOR LEISURE AS WELL AS
ACADEMIC ACTIVITY; VOCATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOLS, WHERE THEY CATER FOR STUDENTS
FROM ALL LEVELS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, PROVIDE SPECIAL HELP FOR FOREIGN
STUDENTS WITH LANGUAGE PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP POSSIBILITIES FOR JOB FLEXIBILITY.
CLEAR, PREFERABLY BINDING, REGULATIONS ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE NEEDED.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC.
     
SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA CAME TO LIFE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST
CENTURY, BUT THEIR FULL DEVELOPMENT BEGAN AFTER WORLD WAR II. IN 1976 A
REORGANISATION TOOK PLACE AIMED AT TEACHING PUPILS TO FIND OUT REQUIRED
INFORMATION INDEPENDENTLY AND CREATIVELY. THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WITH ITS
RESULTING TASKS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES IS DISCUSSED.
DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING 1981.
     
REPORT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE 1981 ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION BY LISE OSTERGAARD. THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE TRANSFER OF
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FROM
THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IS REVIEWED. IT IS THE TASK OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES,
HOWEVER, TO ENSURE THE OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES, SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER IN PROMOTING CULTURAL, INFORMATIONAL AND
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE CHANGE IN THE LAW GOVERNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES IS A
STEP FORWARD, STRENGTHENING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARY
CONTROLLED BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. PRODUCTION OF BOOKS
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IS IMPORTANT AND HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN
DENMARK OVER THE LAST 10-20 YEARS, LARGELY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES. 80% OF ALL DANISH CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE PURCHASED BY PUBLIC, SCHOOL
AND INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES. THE FUT URE OF SUCH BOOKS DEPENDS ON THE
WILLINGNESS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IN SPITE OF BUDGETARY PROBLEMS, TO PROVIDE
YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A BROAD RANGE OF LITERATURE.
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND BASIC EDUCATION IN FIRST AND SECOND GRADE SCHOOLS IN THE
STATE OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL.
     
DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS AS
PRESCRIBED BY BRAZILIAN STATE LEGISLATION, AND SUGGESTS CLOSER INTEGRATION OF
SCHOOL AND LIBRARY TASKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE STRUCTURE OF SCHOOL
ORGANISATION, WHICH ASSIGNS THE LIBRARY TO THE CATEGORY OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT
FOR TEACHING PROGRAMMES AND DESIGNATES IT AN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY.
CRITICISES THIS AS AN INADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY'S ROLE, AND ARGUES
FOR ACTIVE COLLABORATION IN THE TEACHING PROCESS, AS A BACK-UP MULTI-MEDIA
RESOURCE CENTRE. EXAMINES THE OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY, AND SHOWS HOW
INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF EVEN ITS NOMINAL
TASKS. IN CONCLUSION A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS PROPOSED,
PERMITTING TOTAL INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND TEACHING PROGRAMMES AT ALL LEVELS.
LIBRARIES IN TANDEM. THE COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL AND PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES, BRIEFLY, THE FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRES
AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THEIR INTERACTION AND COOPERATION IN NEW ZEALAND.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN PAPUA NEW
GUINEA THROUGH A DISCUSSION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, A
STATE OF THE ART REVIEW OF THE CURRENT SCHOOL LIBRARY SITUATION, AND A SUMMARY
OF THE EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND. STRESSES THE NEED FOR A
RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF RESOURCE-BASED EDUCATION, AND SUGGESTS A STRATEGY
FOR CHANGE, PROPOSALS FOR A COURSE FOR TEACHER-LIBRARIANS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY STANDARDS.
THE TEACHER AND THE MEDIA CENTRE-PROBLEMS AND DISTURBANCES IN USE.
     
THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES AS
INDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEEN
DISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLY
NOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLY
ON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OF
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THE
TEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNING
SITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULD
PROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE AND
ECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOM
AND MEDIA CENTRE, FLEXIBLE TIMETABLES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.
A DAY IN THE MEDIA CENTRE AT THE BUDENBERG SCHOOL, HAIGER.
     
THE SCHOOL CATERS FOR ABOUT 90 EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. THE MEDIA
CENTRE IS RUN BY TEACHERS WITH AN ASSISTANT ON CIVILIAN SERVICE DUTY; IT IS
HOUSED IN A MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM OF ABOUT 300 SQ. M. THE CENTRE OPENS AT 7.30
A.M. SO THAT CHILDREN CAN USE IT FOR LEISURE AND READING ACTIVITIES UNTIL
LESSONS START AT 8 A.M. THE CENTRE CONTAINS BOOKS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON
PICTORIAL MATERIAL, RECORDS, VIDEO GAMES AND CASSETTES. PUPILS ARE GIVEN
INSTRUCTION ON USING THE CENTRE. THE SCHOOL IS THE REGIONAL CENTRE FOR THE
LOAN OF TEXTBOOK SETS. DANCING AND FILM SESSIONS ARE ALSO HELD IN THE CENTRE
AND PUPILS CAN COME IN AGAIN FOR LEISURE ACTIVITIES WHEN LESSONS FINISH,
BEFORE GOING HOME AT 1 P.M. DURING AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS THE CENTRE IS USED
FOR CONFERENCES, PARENTS' MEETINGS AND SENIOR CITIZENS' ACTIVITIES.
HAS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SCHOOL LIBRARIES FINISHED?.
     
SINCE THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, THE VALUE OF A CENTRALLY SITUATED SCHOOL LIBRARY
OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ENCOURAGING A LIFE-LONG LEARNING PROCESS HAS
BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED. THE DISCUSSION RECEIVED FRESH IMPETUS AFTER 1970 WITH
THE DEVELOPMENT OF USA, UK AND SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES AND RENEWED
INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
CLASSROOMS MUST BE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE; THEIR
EVOLUTION INTO CLASS MEDIA CENTRES HAS ONLY OCCURRED SO FAR IN PRIMARY
SCHOOLS, A CHANGE DEMANDING GOOD ORGANISATION AND CLOSE LINKS WITH THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP CLASSROOM-SCHOOL MEDIA
CENTRE-PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN BE EQUATED WITH EMUNDS' '3-TIER' LIBRARY SYSTEM;
EACH COMPONENT MUST HAVE ITS TASKS CLEARLY DEFINED.
THE EVOLVEMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARY RESOURCE CENTRES IN KENYA.
     
(MA DISSERTATION.) AIMS TO HELP THE KENYAN EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS
TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY RESOURCE CENTRE IN THE EDUCATIONAL
PROCESS AND IN THE SCHOOL PROGRAMME, AND THUS EMBARK ON A PLAN TO DEFINE ITS
OBJECTIVES AND UNDERTAKE A PROGRAMME OF CONSTRUCTION FOR THEIR REALISATION.
LIBRARY WORK WITH HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN A BRANCH LIBRARY.
     
THE LIBRARIAN AT A BRANCH LIBRARY IN POTSDAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH TEACHERS AT
THE SPECIAL SCHOOL NEARBY, DISCUSSING SUITABLE LIBRARY MATERIAL AND ARRANGING
SPECIAL EVENTS SUCH AS AUTHORS' VISITS. CHILDREN FROM THE LOWER FORMS ARE
BROUGHT INTO THE LIBRARY TO SAMPLE THE BOOKS AND LEARN ABOUT THE LIBRARY
SERVICE; THE CHILDREN ENJOY THEIR VISITS AND OFTEN RETURN AGAIN DURING LEISURE
HOURS. STOCKS MOST USEFUL TO THEM ARE LARGE PRINT BOOKS AND PICTORIAL
MATERIAL. THE LIBRARIAN HAS ACQUIRED A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUAL READERS
AND THEIR INTERESTS. THROUGH CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES,
HANDICAPPED READERS FROM OTHER AREAS OFTEN COME TO USE THIS LIBRARY. GOOD
CONTACTS WITH PARENTS ARE ALSO VALUABLE; A MEETING IS PLANNED TO INTRODUCE
PARENTS TO LITERATURE ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF HANDICAP.
THE AFRICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH AFRICA-ITS ROLE ON THE BLACK LIBRARY
SCENE.
     
THE AFRICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH AFRICA HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR 17
YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD IT HAS CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE PROMOTION OF THE
READING HABIT AMONG BLACKS AND WITH THE UPGRADING OF THE QUALITY OF PERSONS
ENGAGED IN LIBRARY WORK BY MEANS OF VACATION SCHOOLS AND SEMINARS. IT HAS MADE
REPRESENTATIONS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL THOSE
CONCERNED WITH THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR BLACKS, EITHER TO START
LIBRARY SERVICES WHERE THESE WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE OR TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING
ONES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LOCAL INHABITANTS.
PUBLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.
     
IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO
OFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ON
THE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILE
THE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.
IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.
IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THE
BASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.
AS SOME 66% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THE
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESE
CHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THE
SUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLE
LIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACH
IS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
ASPECTS CONCERNING THE PROGRESS IN THE USE OF THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION (IN
ENGLISH AND RUMANIAN).
     
PRESENTS CONCLUSIONS FROM A STUDY OF USERS' INFORMATION HABITS CONCERNING THE
DEGREE OF USE OF SOME TYPES OF INFORMATION SOURCE IN 3 STAGES' THE
DISCIPLINE-ORIENTED; THE GOAL ORIENTED; AND THE PROBLEM-ORIENTED. THE
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE STAGES IS THE PROCESS OF GRADUAL UNDERSTANDING
OF INFORMATION WHICH MODIFIES THE INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF THE USERS.
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE CONCERNING THE APPROACH OF SECONDARY INFORMATION
SOURCES TO THE CONCRETE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF USERS CONFRONTED WITH
PRACTICAL PROBLEMS.
USER FLUCTUATION AS THE TOTALITY OF USER MOVEMENT.
     
STATISTICS PRODUCED BY KOPENICK DISTRICT LIBRARY IN BERLIN BETWEEN 1969-79
SHOW THAT EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF NEW USERS ARE REGISTERED ALTHOUGH
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF READERS GROWS ONLY SLOWLY. THESE FIGURES REFLECT NATIONAL
TRENDS. THE USE OF THE TERM FLUCTUATION IN THIS CONTEXT IS DISCUSSED. USERS
MAY LEAVE A LIBRARY FOR VARIOUS REASONS' UNAVOIDABLY, THROUGH ILLNESS OR
DEATH; FROM SOCIAL NECESSITY, AS WHEN TRANSFERRING FROM THE CHILDREN'S TO THE
ADULT LIBRARY; FOR SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE REASONS, E.G. MOVING HOUSE, MILITARY
SERVICE; UNDESIRABLY, BECAUSE THEY FIND THE LIBRARY SERVICE UNSATISFACTORY.
ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE STATISTICS SHOWS THAT 2/3 OF THE KOPENICK RESIDENTS
DO NOT USE THE LIBRARY AT ALL, WHICH AGAIN REFLECTS A NATIONAL TREND.
USER STUDIES' A REVIEW OF IDEAS.
     
BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSE WORK PREPARED IN 1979, BASED ON A REVIEW OF
THE LITERATURE. RECENT STUDIES HAVE TENDED TO ADOPT A SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH'
THE MOST COMMONLY USED SURVEY TECHNIQUES ARE OUTLINED, AND THEIR LIMITATIONS
CRITICISED. SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF STUDIES OF USERS OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION ARE SUMMARISED, TO ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING HOW
USERS INTERACT WITH INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE CHIEF FACTORS DETERMINING USER
BEHAVIOUR ARE ISOLATED, AND THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH EMPHASISED.
CONSIDERS THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
AN AREA HITHERTO VIRTUALLY UNRESEARCHED. THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING MORE ABOUT
POTENTIAL USERS HERE IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE.
THE MEETING OF READING RESEARCH SPECIALISTS.
     
REPORTS ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH MEETING OF READING RESEARCH SPECIALISTS
FROM EASTERN EUROPE, USSR AND CUBA THAT TOOK PLACE IN BERLIN 18-21 NOV 80. THE
ASPECTS OF READING RESEARCH DISCUSSED INCLUDED' METHODOLOGY OF COMPARATIVE
READING ANALYSIS, DYNAMICS OF READING AND READING REQUESTS IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES, THEORY OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO RESEARCH RESULTS
AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, THE SCIENCE OF READING AND ITS HISTORY,
READER-LIBRARIAN RELATIONSHIP, PRINCIPLES OF THE STUDY OF READING AND THE USE
OF LIBRARIES, WORK WITH YOUNG READERS IN LIBRARIES AND THE STUDY OF READERS'
INTERESTS. OTHER PAPERS REPORTED ON THE STATE OF THE ART OF READING IN
PARTICULAR LOCATIONS, BOTH NATIONAL AND LOCAL.
THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WALTER HOFMANN AND RUDOLF ANGERMANN TOWARDS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF USER RESEARCH METHODS, PART I.
     
HOFMANN AND ANGERMANN CARRIED OUT THEIR RESEARCH AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
CENTURY, DURING THE PERIOD OF THE MOVEMENT FOR POPULAR EDUCATION. THEY FELT
THAT LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KNOW ABOUT EACH READER'S REQUIREMENTS FROM AND
MOTIVATION TOWARDS READING SO THAT THE LIBRARY COULD PERFORM EFFECTIVELY ITS
EDUCATIVE FUNCTION. HOFMANN ADVOCATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACT
BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS AND OF TYPOLOGICAL GROUPING OF READERS WITH THE AID
OF LOAN FREQUENCY STATISTICS. HIS NEW CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR SUBJECT
INDEXES WAS USED IN COMPILING CATALOGUES OF THE LEIPZIG BUCHERHALLE. HOFMANN
ALSO FAVOURED THE USE OF SELECTIVE INDEXES AIMED AT TARGET GROUPS IN ADDITION
TO THAT OF GENERAL CATALOGUES.
THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN QUEBEC IN RELATION TO CERTAIN INBUILT VARIABLES.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL IN 1980-81, TO
INVESTIGATE UNDER-USAGE, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUCH ELEMENTS IN THE INTERNAL
SYSTEM OF LIBRARY ORGANISATION AND OPERATION AS THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS
AVAILABLE, STAFFING ARRANGEMENTS, AND HOURS OF OPENING. DATA WERE COLLECTED
FROM A SAMPLE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF POTENTIAL USERS BY INTERVIEW AND
QUESTIONNAIRE, AND ANALYSED MANUALLY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF CALCULATIONS TO
ESTABLISH THE RATE OF UNDER-USE, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EFFECT OF THE
VARIABLES TESTED. FINDINGS SHOWED HOURS OF OPENING TO HAVE THE GREATEST
INFLUENCE ON USE. CONCLUDES THAT ULTIMATELY THE LEVEL OF STAFFING IS CRUCIAL
IN PROMOTING LIBRARY USE, AND RECOMMENDS THAT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ON
LIBRARY PERSONNEL TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT.
LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SECONDARY TEACHING. RESULTS OF RECENT
AMERICAN AND CANADIAN RESEARCH.
     
EXTRACT FROM A PROJECT FOR A THESIS IN EDUCATION SCIENCES PREPARED FOR THE
UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL. AMERICAN THESES FROM 1976-77 TO 1980-81 ON SECONDARY
SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE FOCUSSED ON THE TOPICS OF MEDIA PROGRAMMES, PERSONNEL,
AND USE, WHEREAS IN QUEBEC INTEREST HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED CHIEFLY ON USE. THE
RESULTS OF RESEARCH ON USE ARE SUMMARISED, AND THE SITUATION IN THE USA IN
GENERAL COMPARED WITH QUEBEC. QUEBEC SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE, AND IS FAR FROM
MOVING TOWARDS THE AMERICAN CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY AS CENTRAL TO ALL
TEACHING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH THE REASONS FOR THIS
DEVELOPING CRISIS.
THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TOWARDS THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING
OF STUDENTS.
     
THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED OF A PILOT SURVEY CARRIED OUT AT THE HUMBOLDT
UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN. THE 60 STUDENTS INTERVIEWED STRESSED THAT PERSONAL
CONTACT BETWEEN LECTURER AND STUDENT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT AID TO EDUCATION,
WHEN ADVICE ON READING AND WORK METHODS COULD BE GIVEN; THEY ALSO VALUED
READING SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHER STUDENTS. AT LEAST 1/2 THE STUDENTS INTERVIEWED
FOUND THE LIBRARY STAFF HELPFUL IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON LITERATURE STUDY. THE
LIBRARY WAS A GOOD PLACE FOR WORKING, ALTHOUGH DELAYS IN OBTAINING BOOKS
SOMETIMES HELD UP THE STUDY PROGRAMME. SOME STUDENTS FELT THAT CONCENTRATION
ON EXAMINATIONS IMPEDED THE GROWTH OF CREATIVE ABILITY. CLOSE CONTACT BETWEEN
LECTURERS AND LIBRARIANS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS AND STUDY
METHODS.
THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IN ORGANISATION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION
LIBRARIES AND IN THEIR SPECIALISED INFORMATION ACTIVITY (IN ENGLISH AND
RUMANIAN).
     
THE PROMPT SUPPLY OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION REQUIRED BY EDUCATION, RESEARCH
AND PRODUCTION, AND REDUCTION OF RESEARCH TIME ARE THE ULTIMATE AIMS OF HIGHER
EDUCATION LIBRARIES. PROPOSES THE REDUCTION OF 'DEAD TIME' IN SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH BY' IMPROVEMENT OF THE READING CONDITIONS BY PROMPT SERVING OF THE
READER; KEEPING SPECIALISED STOCK IN SPECIALISED LIBRARIES; SHORTENING TIME
DEVOTED TO BIBLIOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT. SUGGESTS THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEANS OF
OBTAINING MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN MINIMUM TIME AND WITH MINIMUM EFFORT.
WHAT ABOUT THE NON-USERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY?.
     
THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF
THE USER 2VERSUS1 THE NON-USER OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS CONSIDERED. THE
IMPLICATION IS THAT THE LIBRARY CAN BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF IT APPLIES ITS
RESOURCES TOWARDS MEETING THE CULTURAL NEEDS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. SOUTH
AFRICA IN THE MAIN LACKS RESEARCH ON COMMUNITY NEEDS RELEVANT TO LIBRARY
SERVICES. RESEARCH ON THE NON-USER IN THE UK, THE USA AND SOUTH AFRICA IS
BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE LIBRARY SHOULD MEET CULTURAL NEEDS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF
THE USER AND NOT OF THE LIBRARIAN. THIS MAKES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY THE MOST
COMPLEX OF ALL LIBRARY TYPES BECAUSE OF ITS DIVERSE USER TYPES. AN EXAMPLE IS
GIVEN OF HOW THE CAPE TOWN CITY LIBRARIES CHANGED ITS POLICY IN SELECTING
CHILDREN'S BOOKS TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDS MORE ADEQUATELY.
THE PROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION OF QUEBEC AND OF CANADA.
     
PRESENTS STATISTICAL DATA COMPARING QUEBEC WITH CANADA AS A WHOLE, ON THE
PROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ADULT POPULATION; AND ON THE PROPORTION OF
READERS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MATERIAL IN THE ELDERLY (OVER 65) POPULATION. THE
POSITION OF THE ELDERLY POPULATION IS THEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE TOTAL
ADULT POPULATION, AND IN CONCLUSION DISCUSSES THE PROBABILITY THAT THE NUMBER
OF ELDERLY READERS, AND PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS, WILL INCREASE, NECESSITATING
EXPANSION OF LIBRARY FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS.
UTILIZATION OF SOME INFORMATION SOURCES BY STUDENTS IN TERMS OF THE PURPOSE
FOR WHICH THE INFORMATION IS USED.
     
STUDY OF THE INFORMATION SOURCES USED BY STUDENTS, IN RELATION TO THEIR
INFORMATION NEEDS. FOR COURSE MATERIAL THEY USE HANDBOOKS, TEXTS AND
STANDARDS, BUT FOR STUDY OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS THEY USE JOURNAL ARTICLES. OTHER
RESULTS ARE PRESENTED, AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FOR THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION FIELD.
THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE READER.
     
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE EVINCE A GROWING DEMAND FOR BOOKS. BUT WHERE WILL THE PAPER
FOR MULTI-MILLION EDITIONS COME FROM? TRANSITION TO AN URBAN LIFE STYLE HAS
LED TO A GREATER DEMAND FOR BOOKS. MANY, WHO ARE NEW TO BOOK CULTURE, CONSIDER
BOOKS AS PROUD POSSESSIONS, NOT FOR USE. THE DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS BEGINNING TO
RESEMBLE THAT FOR THE MASS MEDIA. BESTSELLERS EXACERBATE LIBRARIES' PROBLEM
SITUATION. BESTSELLER TEXTS SHOULD IN FUTURE BE TRANSLATED TO ANOTHER
INFORMATION CARRIER AND BE DISSEMINATED BY LIBRARIES OR THE TRADE. HOMES AND
LIBRARIES WILL STILL NEED THOSE BOOKS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
READER.
INVESTIGATION OF EFFICIENCY WITH FEEDBACK CARDS.
     
IN ORDER THAT AN INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF
RELEVANCE, PERTINENCE, CURRENCY AND OFFER COMPLETE INFORMATION, CONSTANT
CONTROL AND ASSESSMENT REPORTS FROM USERS ARE NEEDED. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FEEDBACK. NOWADAYS, IN THE FIELD OF MANUAL SERVICES THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF FEEDBACK IS GROWING. AFTER DESCRIBING SOME METHODS OF FEEDBACK
AND FEEDBACK CARDS, INTRODUCES A SUBJECT FIELD OBSERVING SERVICE OFFERING
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA WHICH IS CARRIED OUT BY THE HUNGARIAN MEDICAL INFORMATION
INSTITUTE AND LIBRARY. DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT TO FIND OUT, WITH THE HELP OF
FEEDBACK CARDS, THE SUBSCRIBERS' OPINION ON SERVICES.
WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DO TO INCREASE LITERACY?.
     
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS A RESOURCE FOR CULTURALLY
ADVANCED AND LITERATE PEOPLE. SOUTH AFRICA HAS BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING
COMMUNITIES. WHILE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY USUALLY FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OF
ESTABLISHED READERS, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL CASE FOR PROVIDING INNOVATIVE
FORMS OF SERVICE TO ILLITERATE AND NEO-LITERATE COMMUNITIES, AND FOR ACTUALLY
PROMOTING LITERACY THROUGH THE LIBRARY. THE CONCEPT OF LITERACY IS DISCUSSED
IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING SECTORS, AND LITERACY IS PLACED IN
ITS CULTURAL CONTEXT. THE PROBLEMS OF SEMI-ILLITERACY AMONG EDUCATED PEOPLE
ARE SEEN AS PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF ILLITERACY, WHICH EXTENDS FROM FORMALLY
EDUCATED PEOPLE WITH POOR READING ABILITY TO UNEDUCATED RURAL DWELLERS. THE
ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH REGARD TO LITERACY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IS
DISCUSSED, WITH SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS GIVEN FOR TASKS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
CAN UNDERTAKE TO PROMOTE LITERACY.
READING AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES.
     
CRITICISES THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO READING IN SCHOOLS, WHERE BOOKS ARE
USED ESSENTIALLY FOR DIDACTIC PURPOSES. INSTEAD ARGUES THAT THE USE OF BOOKS
SHOULD BE GEARED TO AROUSING INTEREST IN READING, AND PROPOSES THE
INTRODUCTION OF TEXT-BASED GAMES, SERVING THE DUAL PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING THE
CAPACITY FOR REFLECTIVE THOUGHT AS WELL AS LEADING THE CHILD TO READ WITH
ENJOYMENT. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF 3 TYPES OF GAMES FOR PARTICULAR AGE GROUPS,
WITH FULL DETAILS OF OBJECTIVES, MATERIALS REQUIRED, AND PROCEDURE.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION ('VOLKSHOCHSCHULEN') IN WEST GERMANY.
     
EXAMINES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION IN
WEST GERMANY COOPERATE. DISCUSSES THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND' POLITICAL
PROGRAMMES CONCERNING THE CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF WEST GERMANY AS A WHOLE, AND
THEIR INFLUENCE ON POLITICAL DECISIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL, GIVING NORTHRHINE
WESTPHALIA AS AN EXAMPLE. ALSO COMPARES THE PROGRAMMES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND
ADULT EDUCATION AND REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH ORGANISATIONS FORMULATE THOUGHTS,
PLANS AND CONCEPTS REGARDING COOPERATION, WHICH REVEAL MUTUAL RELATIONS. 4
EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THIS COOPERATION WORKS IN REALITY.
ADULT EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES.
     
A COLLECTION OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT 2 SEMINARS DEALING WITH THE ROLE OF INDIAN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE PROMOTION OF READING AND ADULT EDUCATION.
THE LIBRARY ROLE IN ADULT EDUCATION' AN EXPERIMENT AT BROADSTAIRS,
SITTINGBOURNE AND FAVERSHAM LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES COOPERATION IN SEPT 80 BETWEEN BROADSTAIRS, SITTINGBOURNE AND
FAVERSHAM PUBLIC LIBRARIES (KENT, UK) WITH LOCAL ADULT EDUCATION CENTRES AND
OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ADVICE TO THE PUBLIC. THE COMMON AIM
WAS TO HELP INTENDING ADULT STUDENTS TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE FROM THE WIDE
RANGE OF LOCAL OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN THE COMING AUTUMN PROGRAMME. ALSO
BROADSTAIRS LIBRARY TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE WAYS IN WHICH IT CAN HELP STUDENTS TO
MAKE THEIR COURSES MORE EFFECTIVE.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS IN COOPERATION.
     
THE ADULT EDUCATION MOVEMENT BUILT UP LIBRARIES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH
CENTURY, BUT WHEN THESE WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ORGANISATIONS AND LIBRARIES LARGELY CEASED. CONSCIOUS
OF THIS, OREBRO REGIONAL LIBRARY IN CONJUNCTION WITH 4 PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND 4
ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS DREW UP A PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE CULTURAL
COUNCIL FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD OF 1 YEAR, WITH A PART-TIME LIBRARIAN AS
ORGANISER. THE AIM WAS TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE LEADERS, EXAMINE THE
ASSOCIATIONS' NEEDS AND HOW THE LIBRARY COULD MEET THEM. DIRECT CONTACT WITH
THE CLASS LEADERS PROVED DIFFICULT AND ADVANCE NOTICE OF BOOKS NEEDED HARD TO
OBTAIN. STUDY VISITS TO THE LIBRARY WERE MADE BY SOME GROUPS, AND SPECIAL AND
BACKGROUND LITERATURE WAS LENT TO THE GROUPS ON LONG LOANS. CONCLUDES THAT THE
LIBRARIES OFTEN LACKED STAFF AND TIME TO TAKE THE NECESSARY INITIATIVES, AND
THAT THE STUDY GROU P LEADER IS THE KEY TO ANY FRUITFUL CONTACT.
REFERENCE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND STUDENTS IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
CONSIDERS THE SERVICE RENDERED BY THE BLOEMFONTEIN PUBLIC LIBRARY SOUTH
AFRICA. THE REASONS WHY PUPILS IN THE 11-16 YEARS AGE GROUP USED THE LIBRARY
AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ARE GIVEN AS DETERMINED THROUGH A SURVEY. STUDENTS
WERE NOT SIMILARLY SURVEYED BUT IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR LIBRARY USE ARE GIVEN.
ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED OF LIBRARIANS SERVING THESE 2
GROUPS, AND TO METHODS OF DEVELOPING THESE CAPABILITIES. SOURCES OF
INFORMATION MUST PROVIDE MANY LEVELS OF ENTRY TO INFORMATION TO CATER FOR
CHILDREN AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF SWIFT ADVANCEMENTS IN
THE EDUCATION OF BLACK CHILDREN, SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN EXPECT
GREAT STRAINS IN THE 1980S IN PROVIDING THE REQUIRED REFERENCE SERVICES.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARIAN AS ADULT LEARNERS' ADVISOR-AN INNOVATION IN HUMAN
SERVICES.
     
CONCERNS THE SERVICING OF THE ADULT LEARNER WHO IS PURSUING STUDY PROJECTS FOR
CREDIT OR FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT AND WHO USES THE LIBRARY AS A RESOURCE
CENTRE. FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN AS A LEARNERS' ADVISOR, ONE WHO
ASSISTS THE PATRON IN MODES SPECIFIED BY THE NATURE OF THE LEARNING PROJECT,
THE EXTENT OF THE COLLECTION AND SERVICES OFFERED BY THE LIBRARY, AND THE
DEMANDS OF THE PROGRAMME THAT THE LIBRARY IS IMPLEMENTING.
TRENDS IN MODERN BIBLIOTHERAPY.
     
GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO AUTHOR'S OWN WORK CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION WITH THE
PSYCHIATRIC DEPARTMENT OF THE DISTRICT MEDICAL CENTRE. PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS
ARE GIVEN 1 HOUR PER WEEK OF GROUP READING, DISCUSSIONS, AND WRITING SHORT
ESSAYS ON SELECTED LITERATURE IN THE PRESENCE OF A LIBRARIAN, A PSYCHOLOGIST
AND A PSYCHIATRIST. BIBLIOTHERAPY AIMS AT BREAKING THE SILENCE BARRIER AND
HELPING SELF-EXPRESSION. NEW TRENDS ARE BEING INTRODUCED WHICH TAKE
BIBLIOTHERAPY FROM CLINICS INTO LIBRARIES FOR PATIENTS RELEASED FROM
INSTITUTIONAL CARE. SCHOOLS OF LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST, AS
SPECIALISED LIBRARIANS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS WORK.
SEMINAR ON BIBLIOTHERAPY.
     
PAPERS PRESENTED AT A SEMINAR ON BIBLIOTHERAPY APPLIED TO OLDER ADULTS AND
CONDUCTED BY THE LIBRARY SCHOOL, WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY AT MADISON, 21-23 JUNE
78 WITH CO-SPONSORSHIP BY THE FAYE MCBEATH INSTITUTE ON AGING AND ADULT LIFE
AND FUNDING FROM THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION ON AGING. THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE
PRESENTED; 'TOWARD A RESEARCH BASIS FOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
EDUCATIONAL/HUMANISTIC AND CLINICAL MODES OF BIBLIOTHERAPY', BY FRANKLIN M.
BERRY; 'RELATION OF BIBLIOTHERAPY TO PSYCHIATRIC THEORY', BY LOIS HINSETH;
'BIBLIOTHERAPY WITH OLDER ADULTS IN THE LIBRARY CONTEXT', BY RHEA JOYCE RUBIN;
'BIBLIOTHERAPY IN PRACTICE WITH OLDER ADULTS', BY CLARA E. LACK; 'RESEARCH IN
BIBLIOTHERAPY APPLICABLE TO SELF-ACTUALIZATION IN OLDER ADULTS', BY RHONDA
GANDEL; 'EDUCATION OF THE BIBLIOTHERAPIST', BY ARLEEN HYNES; 'EDUCATION OF
LIBRARIANS FOR BIBLIOTHERAPEUTIC SERVICE', BY MARGARET E. MONROE; 'AN
ORIENTATION TO THE BIBLIOTHERAPEUTIC PROCESS FOR LIBRARIANS', BY MARGARE T E.
MONROE.
BIBLIOTHERAPY IN THE CONTEXT OF PSYCHOTHERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH NERVOUS
DISORDERS.
     
NEUROTICALLY DISTURBED PATIENTS UNDERGOING GROUP THERAPY TREATMENT WERE
PRESENTED WITH 6 LITERARY TEXTS, INCLUDING WORKS BY BOLL AND SAINT-EXUPERY;
THEIR REACTIONS TO THEM WERE ANALYSED AND COMPARED WITH THOSE OF A GROUP OF
PEOPLE IN NORMAL HEALTH. THE PATIENTS REGARDED THE TEXTS SUBJECTIVELY, USING
THEM AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSION OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES; THE OTHERS
SAW IN THE TEXTS AN OBJECTIVE REFLECTION OF GENERAL SOCIAL PROBLEMS. THE
HOSPITAL LIBRARIAN HAD TO FIND TEXTS THAT WOULD HAVE A SUITABLE SIGNIFICANCE
FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDE A STARTING POINT FOR THE REQUIRED THERAPY. IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MEDICAL STAFF IN
SITUATIONS INVOLVING BIBLIOTHERAPY.
MEDICAL LIBRARIES' CHANGES BETWEEN 1970-1978 AND CONDITIONS IN 1979.
     
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN SPECIAL LIBRARIES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1970, 1974, AND 1978. FROM
THE AVERAGE OF 100 SPECIAL LIBRARIES 13 WERE MEDICAL LIBRARIES. HOLDINGS IN
THE ANALYSED SPECIAL LIBRARIES AMOUNTED TO 28.5 MILLION VOLUMES IN 1970, TO
43.6 MILLION IN 1974, AND TO 51.5 MILLION VOLUMES IN 1978. INCREASES 1970-74
AMOUNTED TO 15 MILLION VOLUMES WHILE ACQUISITIONS DECREASED TO 8 MILLION
VOLUMES 1974-78. COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA REVEALED THAT DURING THE EARLY 70S
HOLDINGS IN LOCAL, INSTITUTIONAL, LIBRARIES HAD BEEN AUGMENTED TO A LARGER
EXTENT THAN IN THE 2ND HALF OF THE DECADE. THE SAME TREND WAS VALID FOR THE 13
MEDICAL LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES THE USE OF SPSS (STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES) IN A
BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY OF THE 2BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN NIGERIA1.
RESOURCES FOR ORGANISING A BRAILLE LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES THE 3 CHIEF FIELDS OF ACTIVITY IN BRAILLE LIBRARIES' PRODUCTION OF
BRAILLE BOOKS AND TAPES, WITH DETAILS OF THE EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL REQUIRED;
CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION OPERATIONS, WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR LOCATION AND
ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTIONS; AND USER SERVICES, INCLUDING BOTH INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION, AND PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES FOR THE VISUALLY
HANDICAPPED. THE NECESSITY FOR TRAINING VOLUNTEER HELPERS IS EMPHASISED AND
THEIR ROLE DESCRIBED.
REACHING PEOPLE' A MANUAL ON PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIES SERVING BLIND AND
PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED INDIVIDUALS.
     
DIRECTED TOWARDS LIBRARY STAFF MEMBERS INVOLVED IN PUBLIC EDUCATION, THIS
MANUAL PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR MAKING COMMUNITY MEMBERS AWARE OF TALKING BOOKS
AND BRAILLE MATERIALS PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE BLIND
AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED. THE 1ST SECTION COVERS PUBLICITY THROUGH LOCAL
MASS MEDIA. SUGGESTIONS FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATIONALLY PREPARED
INFORMATION, AND FOR PREPARING LOCAL EXHIBITS AND PUBLICITY MATERIAL ARE
PROVIDED IN THE 2ND SECTION. THE 3RD SECTION OFFERS TIPS FOR REACHING CURRENT
AND POTENTIAL USERS THROUGH MAILINGS, LOCAL ORGANISATIONS AND EVENTS, AND
SPEAKERS BUREAUX. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ORGANISING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS COLLECTION.
     
IN ORDER TO PROMOTE AN AWARENESS AMONG LIBRARIANS OF LOCAL DOCUMENTS AS AN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION RESOURCE, AN 18 MONTH LOCAL DOCUMENTS PROJECT WAS
INITIATED IN NOV 76, SPONSORED BY THE ILLINOIS REGIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL OF
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. THE END PRODUCTS ARE A REPORT, A DIRECTORY OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS COLLECTIONS IN CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THIS MANUAL
COVERING THE ACQUISITION, ORGANISATION, CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION, AND
PUBLICITY OF LOCAL DOCUMENTS COLLECTIONS. AIMS TO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF LOCAL
DOCUMENTS AMONG BOTH LIBRARIANS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR
UNIQUE VALUE AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR LOCAL INFORMATION AND LOCAL HISTORY.
GOVERNMENT INFORMATION IN THE 80S' A SYMPOSIUM.
     
DESCRIBES A SYMPOSIUM ON US AND CANADIAN GOVERNMENT MATERIALS SPONSORED BY THE
FACULTY OF LIBRARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, ONTARIO, 19-21 NOV 81. THE
PROGRAMME COVERED COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT, ORGANISATION, ACCESS TO INFORMATION
AND ON-LINE RETRIEVAL.
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SEARCH FOR EXTERIORICA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO BULGARICA
COLLECTIONS IN BULGARIA.
     
AFTER THE DEFINITION AND A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF
EXTERIORICA IN LIBRARIES, DESCRIBES THE HOLDINGS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
PROCESSING OF BULGARICA IN THE NARODNA BIBLIOTEKA KIRIL I METODII (CYRIL AND
METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY) AND ITS BULGARIAN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE. BOTH
CURRENT AND RETROSPECTIVE WORK ARE COVERED IN DETAIL. 2ND PART OF THE STUDY
CONCENTRATES ON BULGARICA COLLECTIONS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ABOUT
THEM IN OTHER LIBRARIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES IN BULGARIA. CONCLUDES WITH A
NOTE ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE FRAMEWORK OF BULGARISTICA UNIFIED
INFORMATION SYSTEM (BULGARISTICA IS A NARROWER TERM THAN BULGARICA)
FUNCTIONING SINCE 1978, AND PROSPECTS FOR ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
TO THE TAIGA FOR MANUSCRIPTS.
     
FOR 16 YEARS THE SIBERIAN DEPARTMENT OF THE AN SSSR ARKHEOGRAFICHESKAYA
KOMISSIYA, (USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ARCHAEOGRAPHIC COMMISSION), HAS SOUGHT,
LISTED AND DESCRIBED EARLY BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS FROM BEYOND THE URALS.

INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES-A SOURCE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
     
SINCE 1966, A CENTRALISED COLLECTION OF INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES AND TECHNICAL
NEWSLETTERS HAS BEEN BUILT UP AT THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY
IN BULGARIA. IN 1979 ABOUT 350,000 ITEMS WERE LISTED. THEY WERE SUPPLIED BY
13,000 COMPANIES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY WERE FROM WEST
GERMANY, MATERIALS IN GERMAN MAINTAINING A STEADY 36%. BOTH ENGLISH (30%) AND
RUSSIAN (9%) ARE ON THE INCREASE AND WHILE 15% OF THE CATALOGUES ARE IN
FRENCH, THE TREND SHOWS A SLOW DECLINE. NEW ACQUISITIONS ARE LISTED IN A
SPECIAL BULLETIN PUBLISHED TWICE A MONTH AND DISTRIBUTED TO SOME 600
SUBSCRIBERS. REGULAR EXHIBITIONS TAKE PLACE AND WITH THIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION
BULGARIA IS AN ACTIVE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SPECIAL INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM ON INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES, COMPUTERISED IN 1980. THE SCHEME SERVES THE
COMECON COUNTRIES ABOVE ALL AND IS HEADED BY THE STATE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY I N MOSCOW.
GERMAN MEDIAEVAL MANUSCRIPTS FROM MONASTERY LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA.
     
THERE ARE ABOUT 1,350 GERMAN MEDIAEVAL MANUSCRIPTS, KNOWN TODAY AS 2CODICES
GERMANICI MONACENSES, 1IN THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY, ABOUT 2/3 OF WHICH CAME
TO MUNICH THROUGH THE SECULARISATION OF THE MONASTERIES. THE GERMAN CODICES

OPEN.
THE PAPYRUS COLLECTION OF THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY AND ITS CATALOGUES.
     
THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY PAPYRUS COLLECTION OF 700 ITEMS WAS BEGUN ABOUT 80
YEARS AGO. NOT ALL ITEMS HAVE BEEN EDITED AS YET SINCE CATALOGUING HAS NEVER
KEPT PACE WITH STOCK INCREASES. THE STUDY OF PAPYRI IS THE YOUNGEST DISCIPLINE
CONNECTED WITH ANTIQUITIES, BEING DEVELOPED BY MOMMSEN IN THE 19TH CENTURY. IN
THE 1970S, WHEN THE COLLECTION WAS MOVED TO LARGER AND BETTER ACCOMMODATION,
WORK BEGAN ON A NEW CATALOGUE. THIS CATALOGUE OFFERS PRIMARILY EDITING, WITH
DESCRIPTIONS OF CONDITION, DATING AND TEXTUAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS ARRANGED
IN 2 MAIN SECTIONS' (1) LITERARY TEXTS; (2) OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE LETTERS, EACH
SECTION BEING SUBDIVIDED INTO EDITED AND UNEDITED WORKS. INITIAL MANUSCRIPT
PREPARATION SHOULD BE COMPLETED AT THE END OF 1981.

ONE. THE ARCHIVES SURVEYED IN PART I ARE: ARCHIVO DE LA CARONA DE ARAGON,
BARCELONA; ARCHIVO GENERAL DE SIMANCAS; ARCHIVO GENERAL DE INDIAS, SEVILLA;
ARCHIVO HISTORICO NACIONAL, MADRID; ARCHIVO GENERAL DE LA ADMINISTRACION,
ALCALA DE HENARES; ARCHIVO-BIBLIOTECA DE LA PRESIDENCIA DEL GOBIERNO, MADRID;
ARCHIVO DEL INSTITUT O NACIONAL DE PREVISION, MADRID.
AMERICAN ARCHIVAL THEORY' THE STATE OF THE ART.
     
CONCLUDES THAT AMERICAN ARCHIVAL THEORY DOES NOT EXIST AS A SYSTEMATICALLY
FORMULATED BODY OF IDEAS BUT IS AN AGGREGATION OF IDEAS DRAWN FROM WELL-TESTED
AND WIDELY ACCEPTED EUROPEAN ARCHIVAL PRINCIPLES AND OF PRAGMATIC CONCEPTS
DEVELOPED TO MEET SPECIAL NEEDS OF AMERICAN ARCHIVAL ADMINISTRATION AND
DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS.
FACULTY PAPERS AND SPECIAL-SUBJECT REPOSITORIES.
     
THE GROWTH OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES AND THE PROLIFERATION OF
REPOSITORIES COLLECTING DOCUMENTS ON SPECIFIC SUBJECTS, HAVE CREATED A COMPLEX
SITUATION REGARDING THE DISPOSITION OF PAPERS OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY
FACULTY MEMBERS. HENCE PAPERS BY FACULTY MEMBERS WORKING IN FIELDS FOR WHICH
SPECIAL-SUBJECT ARCHIVES EXIST MAY BE SOUGHT BY 2 OR MORE COMPETING
INSTITUTIONS. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH SPECIAL-SUBJECT ARCHIVES CAN COOPERATE

LIBRARY IN MUNICH.
     
THIS LIBRARY CONTAINS 1 OF THE 3 LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF HISTORICAL CHILDREN'S
BOOKS IN GERMANY, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING CATALOGUED BY THE DEUTSCHE
FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION). THE OTHER COLLECTIONS
ARE AT BRUNSWICK TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AND THE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH INTO
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AT FRANKFURT UNIVERSITY. THE LIBRARY IN MUNICH WAS
FOUNDED IN 1948 BY JELLA LEPMAN WHO ENCOURAGED THE COLLECTION OF AN
INTERNATIONAL RANGE OF MODERN MATERIAL AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF BOOKS AS GIFTS
FROM PUBLISHERS, INSTITUTIONS AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. WALTER SCHARF, WHO
SUCCEEDED HER IN 1958, BEGAN COLLECTING HISTORICAL AS WELL AS CONTEMPORARY
WORKS AND ACQUIRED SEVERAL LARGE COLLECTIONS FROM OTHER LIBRARIES. THE MUNICH

PLANNING FIELD; BRIEFLY DESCRIBES SOME INFORMATION SOURCES; AND REVEALS SOME
LESSER-KNOWN SOURCES.
POLITICAL LITERATURE IN SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES.
     
BEARING IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION OF EVERY SINGLE
CITIZEN IN A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, THE STAFF IN SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES ARE BOUND TO
PAY DUE ATTENTION TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL
SCIENCES. IT IS DESIRABLE TO SET UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE TO FIND WAYS
OF MAXIMISING THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL LITERATURE UPON READERS. RESOLUTE
POLICIES MUST BE PURSUED, STARTING WITH ACQUISITION, WHICH, IN PARTICULAR WITH
RESPECT TO FOREIGN POLITICAL LITERATURE, MUST BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE. CATALOGUING
AND BUILDING UP OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES MUST SATISFY THE READERS' NEEDS IN
SPEEDY CURRENT AWARENESS. EXHIBITIONS ON THE OCCASION OF IMPORTANT POLITICAL
ANNIVERSARIES AND TOPICAL EVENTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIALISED READING AND
STUDY ROOMS, AND ALSO MORE INTENSE RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF POLITICAL
LITERATURE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE SUGGESTIONS TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS TO STUDY
THIS KIND OF LITERATURE PERMANENTLY AND TO BENE FIT BY IT IN THEIR
PROFESSIONAL CAREERS.
LOST WITHOUT TRACE': CANADIAN ARCHIVAL CLUES TO MARINE DISASTERS.R
     
EVIEW OF CANADIAN SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON MARINE DISASTERS, WITH DETAILS OF

CITATION INDEX ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS CONFUTED THE ORTEGA Y GASSET HYPOTHESIS
OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS WHICH, THEY SAY, ATTRIBUTES MUCH OF THE GROWTH OF
SCIENCE TO THE WORK OF THE AVERAGE SCIENTIST WHO, IT IS SUGGESTED, HAS PAVED
THE WAY WITH HIS 'SMALL' DISCOVERIES FOR THE MEN OF GENIUS. THE CASE STUDY
POINTS OUT THE INCOMPETENT APPLICATION OF CITATION INDEX ANALYSIS AS A
RESEARCH METHOD.
THE CHALLENGE OF NUCLEAR POWER DEVELOPMENT RECORDS.

CONVALESCENCE. IN COOPERATION WITH THE ART CENTRE AT WEIMAR PUBLIC LIBRARY,
WEIMAR HOSPITAL BORROWS PICTURES FOR LONG-TERM LOAN, DISCUSSING REQUIREMENTS
WITH PATIENTS AND HOSPITAL STAFF. 2 YEARS' EXPERIENCE HAS REVEALED THAT'
PICTURES IN ROOMS AND CORRIDORS MAKE THE HOSPITAL SEEM MORE ATTRACTIVE;
PICTURES FOR BED-RIDDEN PATIENTS SHOULD BE LARGE AND CLEARLY VISIBLE, WITH
COLOURS AND SUBJECTS THAT STIMULATE RATHER THAN EXCITE, LANDSCAPES BEING
ESPECIALLY POPULAR; SOME PATIENTS WILL BUY A COPY OF ONE OF THESE PICTURES FOR
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO HOME; AND MEN AND WOMEN OFTEN ENJOY THE SAME PICTURES.

AGGRESSIVELY THEIR SPECIAL COLLECTIONS OF HISTORICAL MATERIALS AND TO BE MORE
AWARE OF THE NEEDS OF HISTORICAL RESEARCHERS.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE DEALT WITH AS THEY RELATE TO' DOUBLE
CONTROL OVER MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES AFFILIATED TO THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARY
SERVICES; THE UNSATISFACTORY PLACE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE MUNICIPAL
HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE; THE DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP OF THE LIBRARY TO SOME
MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS; INADEQUATE FINANCING DUE TO FINANCIAL STRICTURES PLACED
ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES; AND STAFFING SHORTAGES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SKILLED
MANPOWER, POOR PAY AND UNSATISFACTORY ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.
PLANNING SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
A SCHOOL LIBRARY IS A LIBRARY FIRST AND FOREMOST AND MUST ALLOW THE SMOOTH
PROCEDURE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING SUITED TO USERS'
NEEDS. A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OLDER SCHOOL BUILDINGS IS THE LOCATION OF A
CENTRALLY SITUATED ROOM OF SUITABLE SIZE. CAREFUL PRELIMINARY PLANNING BY
ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, LIBRARY AUTHORITIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND THE
ARCHITECT IS ESSENTIAL; THEY MUST ESTABLISH THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THE SCHOOL,
TEACHERS' REQUIREMENTS AND WHETHER THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL USE THE LIBRARY.
QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED INCLUDE BUILDING MATERIALS, FURNITURE, LIGHTING,
FLOORING AND COLOUR SCHEMES. THEN THE ARCHITECT CAN PREPARE PLANS FOR WHICH,
AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION, ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE.
THE ALTERNATIVES OF THE 80S.
     
REPORT ON A CONFERENCE ON THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY,
ORGANISED BY THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND HELD IN SEPT 81. THE
CONFERENCE DISCUSSED' THE NEED FOR A CHANGE OF THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF
LIBRARIES; NEED FOR STRUCTURAL CHANGE OF THE LIBRARY'S INTERNAL ACTIVITIES AND
ADMINISTRATION; AND NEED FOR CHANGE OF ATTITUDES. THE IMPORTANCE OF PERMANENT
LIBRARY PREMISES WAS STRESSED. THE MAIN POINTS OF THE CULTURAL COUNCIL'S
HANDBOOK' 2PUBLIC LIBRARY PREMISES1 WERE OUTLINED. IT OPERATES WITH
SUGGESTIONS FOR 3 TYPES OF MAIN LIBRARY, WITH WELL DEVELOPED INFORMATION
ACTIVITIES CENTRED IN AN 'INFORMATION ZONE'. PREFABRICATED, TRANSPORTABLE
'CULTURE KIOSKS' WERE PUT FORWARD AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BRANCHES AND MOBILES.
IT WAS ARGUED, WITH REFERENCE TO THE PROJECT CHANNEL 2000, A TELEDATA BASED
INFORMATION SYSTEM USED BY COLUMBUS PUBLIC LIBRARY, OHIO, THAT PUBLIC
LIBRARIES SHOULD WELCOME TELECOMMUNICATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE MUST ALSO BE
CONSCIOUS OF  A LOSS OF HUMAN CONTACT.
PLANNING OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND LIBRARY LEGISLATION IN AUSTRIA' THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. THE REFORM OF AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIES STARTED WITH THE
ESTABLISHMENT IN 1970 OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH UNDER
WHOSE JURISDICTION NOW BELONGS 60% OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE CENTRALISATION
HAS PROVED BENEFICIAL FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. IN 1975 THE LAW ON
UNIVERSITY ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS PASSED RESULTING IN THE REORGANISATION
OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITH THE AIM OF BUILDING A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED
LIBRARY SYSTEM BASED ON UNIFIED PRINCIPLES. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE,
FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. CONCLUDES WITH A
REVIEW OF OTHER LAWS RELATED TO LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
LOCAL LIBRARY PERIODICALS.
     
COOPERATION AND COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LITERATURE SUPPLY ARE THE
ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF THE LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS WHICH WERE SET UP IN THE
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE WAKE OF THE UNIVERSITY REFORM. HOWEVER, THE NEW
STRUCTURES REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CURRENT AND CONTINUOUS EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS. LOCAL LIBRARY JOURNALS CAN
CONTRIBUTE CONSIDERABLY TO COMMUNICATION ON THE PREMISES. THEY MAKE THE
LIBRARY SYSTEMS INTELLIGIBLE AND THEY SERVE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND
STRENGTHEN THE CONTACTS BETWEEN LIBRARIES. AS THEY PROMOTE COOPERATION BY THE
INTERLOCKING AND SUPPLY OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, THEY PROVIDE FURTHER
RATIONALE FOR COOPERATION IN LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY AND THE ROYAL LIBRARY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SWEDISH-RUSSIAN
LIBRARY COOPERATION DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS. AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS
RESPECT WAS THE BILATERAL EXCHANGE AGREEMENT IN 1964 WHICH BECAME THE MAINSTAY
OF THE ROYAL LIBRARY'S RUSSIAN COLLECTION. ALTHOUGH THE GOSUDARSTVENNAYA
PUBLICHNAYA BIBLIOTEKA SSSR IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATE LIBRARY) IS THE
LARGEST PARTNER, COOPERATION IS ALSO ESTABLISHED WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE
USSR. OVER THE YEARS MANY PERSONAL CONTACTS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BETWEEN
RUSSIAN AND SWEDISH LIBRARIANS AND EXTENSION ACTIVITIES, BASED ON MATERIALS
FROM THE USSR ORGANISED.

PUBLIC LIBRARIANS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE NECESSITY OF LIBRARIES IN
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
     
INTERVIEWS KAREN KOBBERO, LIBRARIAN AT BALLERUP GYMNASIUM AND AUTHOR OF A
REPORT: PROJECT LIBRARY AND EDUCATION IN BALLERUP. 6 PARTS DEAL WITH SENIOR
SECONDARY SCHOOLS, PREPARATORY COURSES, COMMERCIAL COLLEGES, TEACHER TRAINING
COLLEGES, NURSERY SCHOOL TRAINING, AND TECHNICAL COLLEGES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES
CARRY OUT LIBRARY SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND IT IS
TIME THAT THEY BEGAN TO CLARIFY THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN SERVICE TO STUDENTS.
NO INSTITUTION HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIBRARY SERVICES TO INTERMEDIATE
EDUCATION, AND INTERESTED TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS ARE DISCOURAGED BY THE
AUTHORITIES. TASKS SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND
THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DEALING WITH INTERLENDING AND
THE COLLEGE WITH MATERIAL FOR PROJECT ORIENTED TEACHING DEMANDING MULTIPLE
COPIES. DISCUSSES THE KIND OF MATERIAL WHICH SHOULD BE FOUND I N THE SENIOR
SECONDARY SCHOOL. THE COLLEGES CANNOT BE SELF-SUFFICIENT IN LIBRARY MATERIAL
AND USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE REGIONAL RESOURCE CENTRES WILL ALWAYS BE
NECESSARY. REGISTRATION OF OLD MATERIAL AND WITHDRAWALS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT
FOR THE COLLEGES BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES.
VIEWPOINT' CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BRAZIL. THE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATOR.
     
DISCUSSES THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF A NETWORK SYSTEM, OUTLINING ITS
DEVELOPMENT FROM THE 1ST LIBRARY IN 1937. A DETAILED ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE
NETWORK STRUCTURE, SHOWING THE DIVISION INTO CENTRALISED AND DECENTRALISED
ACTIVITIES. THE EQUIPMENT AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE ARE DESCRIBED, IN RELATION
TO CONVENTIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND WIDER RECREATIONAL PROJECTS, AND FINALLY
CONSIDERS THE IMPORTANCE OF TELEVISION IN CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND THE ROLE OF
THE LIBRARY AS MEDIA SUPPORT.
PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AS SEEN FROM A MULTISTATE NETWORK.
     
COOPERATION AMONG US LIBRARIES IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IS OF LONG STANDING
AND IS AN EXAMPLE OF REGIONAL COOPERATION AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER
LIBRARIES THROUGH INTERLIBRARY LOAN, UNION CATALOGUE, UNION LISTS, COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS BETWEEN 2 COUNTRIES AND OVER A
LARGE AND SPARSELY POPULATED REGION. NETWORKING HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED
SERVICES TO LIBRARY USERS AND IN INCREASED EFFICIENCIES IN LIBRARY OPERATIONS.
IT HAS ALSO INTRODUCED A WHOLE SET OF NEW PROBLEMS THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED IN
THE FORUM PROVIDED AS A RESULT OF THE COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE NEED TO
EXTEND THEM INTO THE FUTURE.
THE PLACE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SYSTEM.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM IS DIVIDED INTO 2
SECTIONS-NATIONAL LIBRARIES (SERVING THE GENERAL PUBLIC) AND SPECIAL
(INCLUDING UNIVERSITY, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES). THE FUNCTION
OF THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY IS HELD BY THE ROYAL LIBRARY; THE COORDINATING
ROLE RESTS WITH THE COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE TENDENCY TOWARD
CENTRALISATION RESULTED, IN 1975, IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COUNCIL FOR
INFORMATION SERVICES WITH THE FUNCTION OF CENTRAL COORDINATION AND PLANNING OF
THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE ORGANISATIONAL ROLE IN THIS SPHERE RESTS
WITH THE ROYAL LIBRARY.
THE BACKGROUND TO A ZEELAND AMALGAMATION' THE ZEELAND PROVINCIAL LIBRARY AND
THE MIDDLEBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PROVINCIAL COUNCIL OF ZEELAND AND THE CITY COUNCIL OF
MIDDLEBURG IN 1981 AGREED JOINTLY TO PROVIDE *67 MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A NEW LIBRARY. THE BUILDING WHICH IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN 1974 WILL HOUSE
THE COMBINED PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES TOGETHER WITH THE ZEELAND CENTRAL
MUSIC LIBRARY. LACK OF SPACE IN THE PRESENT LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THE NEED FOR
CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL AND CITY LIBRARIES LED TO THE
DECISION TO COMBINE THEIR SERVICES. THE NEW BUILDING WILL HAVE A SURFACE AREA
OF 12,000 SQ.M. ON 5 FLOORS WITH SPACE FOR 100 STAFF AND EMPHASIS WILL BE
PLACED ON THE USE OF NEW TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS AUTOMATION AND THE ACQUISITION
AND STORAGE OF NEW TYPES OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, INCLUDING AUDIO-VISUAL

AMALGAMATIONS AND LIBRARIES.
     
IN 1982, 30 AUSTRALIAN COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION, PRINCIPALLY
TEACHER-TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, WILL BE AMALGAMATING. THIS STUDY, UNDERTAKEN
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE VICTORIAN POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,
CONSIDERS THE PROBLEMS LIKELY TO FACE THE LIBRARIES OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS
BECAUSE OF AMALGAMATION AND MULTI-SITE OPERATION. THE AUTHOR VISITED UK
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN OCT 81 AND PRODUCED GUIDELINES FOR ADMINISTRATORS AND
LIBRARIANS OF AUSTRALIAN COLLEGES DERIVED FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL POLYTECHNIC
EXPERIENCE OF SUCH PROBLEMS.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND SOCIAL DEMAND IN BRAZIL.
     
A PAPER DELIVERED AT A 1978 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE DISCUSSING THE FAILURE OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO BECOME AN ACCEPTED COMMUNITY INSTITUTION. CONSIDERS THEIR
ACTUAL STATE AT PRESENT' HOUSED IN SUBSTANDARD BUILDINGS, UNDER-RESOURCED,
STAFFED BY UNTRAINED PERSONNEL, AND USED MAINLY BY STUDENTS. THE IMPORTED
MODEL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVING THE NEEDS OF ALL THE COMMUNITY IS
INAPPROPRIATE TO THE SOCIAL REALITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE SOCIAL STRUCTURE IS BASED
ON CLASS DIVISION. STATISTICS ARE PRESENTED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF POTENTIAL
DEMAND, BUT DESPITE RECENT EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AND THE GROWTH OF
PUBLISHING, THE POPULATION OF NON-USERS REMAINS CONSTANT, AND READING
CONTINUES TO BE AN ELITE LEISURE ACTIVITY. THE INITIATION OF A CULTURAL POLICY
TO BREAK THE CHAINS OF SOCIAL DEPENDENCE AND DEVELOP PLANS FOR SOCIETY AS A
WHOLE IS ADVOCATED.
THE STRUGGLE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW-1975 (IN
HEBREW).
     
WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD
FINANCE 75% OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BUDGETS. THE SITUATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
YEARS HAS BEEN THAT AN EVER-GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THE BUDGET IS COVERED BY
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THIS HAS NOT ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT A DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICES, BUT MAY LEAD TO A SITUATION IN WHICH THE LIBRARIES SECTION
OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE WILL BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE THE HIGH
STANDARDS IT HAS SET, SINCE IT WILL NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO PASS ON TO
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. DOCUMENTS THE ACTIONS AND EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW SINCE ITS FORMATION IN JUNE
78. THESE INCLUDE CORRESPONDENCE AND MEETINGS WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT AND
PARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS AND A PUBLIC EFFORT TO ACHIEVE IMPLEMENTATION, THE
HEIGHT OF WHICH WAS A NATIONAL LIBRARIANS' DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE MINISTRY
OF E DUCATION AND CULTURE IN JERUSALEM IN JAN 80.
ARCHIVAL LEGISLATION 1970-1980.
     
REVIEWS THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO ARCHIVES IN 58 COUNTRIES
DURING THE PERIOD 1970-80.
THE FIRST CENSUS OF AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
DISCUSSES THE 1ST AACOBS (AUSTRALIAN ADVISORY COUNCIL ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SERVICES) TASK FORCE ON STATISTICS, 1973-81 AND PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION AND
EVALUATION IN RELATION TO THE COLLECTION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
STATISTICS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP. SHORTCOMINGS WHICH EMERGED IN THE TASK FORCE'S
NECESSARILY EXPLORATORY APPROACH ARE ACKNOWLEDGED, AND THERE IS SOME COMMENT
ABOUT THE RELATIVE VALUES OF DIFFERING MATERIALS HELD BY AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES,
AND OF DIVERGENCIES IN APPROACHES TO LIBRARY MEASUREMENT IN SOME SECTORS OF
THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY.
PROBLEMS IN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
     
COMPRISES 22 CASE STUDIES STRUCTURED TO MEET THE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING NEEDS
OF STUDENTS AND THE FACILITATIVE TEACHING NEEDS OF INSTRUCTORS. EACH CASE IS
DRAWN FROM AN ORGANISATION OF PRACTISING LIBRARIANS, MEDIA SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS, AND PAPERS ARE GROUPED UNDER THE FOLLOWING BROAD
HEADINGS-PLANNING; ORGANISING; STAFFING; DIRECTING; AND CONTROLLING.
APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE 12TH IASLIC CONFERENCE, ROORKEE, 26-29 DEC 79.
THE WORK OF THE CENTRE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, 1 MARCH 1980-28
FEBRUARY 1981.
     
RECORDS THE ACTIVITIES OF CLAIM DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF A 3 YEAR PERIOD OF
GRANT, FOLLOWING A RE-ASSESSMENT OF ITS AIMS AND OBJECTIVES. THE PROGRAMME
REFLECTS A BROADENING OF INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SECTOR TOGETHER WITH
AN AWARENESS OF PROBLEMS FACING MANAGERS AT A TIME OF STRICT CASH LIMITS BEING
APPLIED TO UK LIBRARIES.
RESPONSIBILITY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY.
     
A TALK GIVEN AT A COURSE ON LEADERSHIP-PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES' HIGH SCHOOL, NOV 81. DISCUSSES POLITICIANS' EXPECTATIONS OF THE
LIBRARY AND ITS STAFF. COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL POLITICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IS
OFTEN HAMPERED BY THE LIBRARIANS' PREFERENCE FOR CENTRALLY IMPOSED NORMS
INSTEAD OF ADAPTATION TO LOCAL NEEDS. BUT IMPOSITION OF OBLIGATIONS TAKES AWAY
SPONTANEITY. OBJECTS TO SELF-APPOINTED MORALISTS GUIDING THE PEOPLE'S CULTURAL
NEEDS IN A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION. COMPREHENSIVENESS, ONE OF THE
LIBRARY OBJECTIVES, CANNOT BE ON THE BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BOOK, WHICH MUST
NECESSARILY PRESENT A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT, BUT MUST BE AN OVERALL GUIDELINE.
THE LIBRARY LAW, LIKE MODERN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LAWS, SHOULD SPECIFY AN
OBLIGATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY, NOT LAY DOWN
EXTERNAL STRUCTURAL NORMS WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE LEADING
LIBRARIAN AND THE LEADING HEAD TEACHER MUST HAVE EQUAL  SAY ON THE CULTURAL
COMMITTEE TO SECURE LIBRARIES' INDEPENDENCE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER FROM
THE EDUCATION SERVICE. LIBRARIES MUST NOURISH THE QUALIFIED DOUBT AND SUPPLY
THE MEANS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY IN THE
DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS. LIBRARIES AND LOCAL POLITICIANS MUST
COOPERATE IN KEEPING ART AND CULTURE INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL
INFLUENCE.
SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES ABROAD' A FEW LESSONS OF AN
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY.
     
THE HUNGARIAN CENTRE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE AND METHODOLOGY CONDUCTED AN
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY BY QUESTIONNAIRE IN 1979/80 OF 47 SUBJECT
DEPARTMENTALISED PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ON THE BASIS OF THE REPLIES RECEIVED, THE
FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS WERE MADE' UNDER 3,000 SQ.M. BASIC AREA AND 300,000
VOLUMES IT IS NOT WORTHWHILE ESTABLISHING FULL SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS; MOVING TO
A NEW BUILDING GENERALLY ENCOURAGES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS;
THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES DEVELOP THE NEW STRUCTURE NOT IN 1 STEP BUT
GRADUALLY; SUBJECTIVE STANDPOINTS PREVAIL OFTEN IN THE DEMARCATION OF SUBJECT
DEPARTMENTS; WHEN SELECTING SPECIAL STAFF THOSE WITH LIBRARY QUALIFICATIONS
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER SPECIALISTS WHO ARE NOT LIBRARIANS.
DECISION TABLE' A TOOL OF SYSTEMS STUDY.
     
DESCRIBES THE PURPOSE AND USE OF DECISION TABLES. DECISION TABLES CAN BE
EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LIBRARIANS AND COMPUTER
PROGRAMMERS. THIS TABULAR APPROACH CAN BE USED NOT ONLY TO EXPRESS THE
DECISION LOGIC IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM, BUT CAN ALSO BE OF IMMENSE HELP IN THE
ANALYSIS OF A DECISION PROBLEM.
THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND SYSTEMS THEORY.
     
OUTLINES THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMS THEORY AND APPLIES THEM TO UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY ORGANISATION, AS PART OF THE GENERAL UNIVERSITY SUPRA-SYSTEM. ANALYSIS
COVERS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LIBRARY; THE PRODUCTION INPUTS, I.E. BOOKS AND
PERIODICALS; MAINTENANCE, TECHNICAL, SUPPORT AND ADAPTATION SUBSYSTEMS; AND
THE OUTPUTS, I.E. SERVICES.
MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES APPLIED IN A SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.
     
MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF
AN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. THE PREREQUISITES ARE THAT THE
INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN MUST GRASP THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A
SERVICE FUNCTION OPERATES IN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THESE
FUNCTIONS. HE MUST ALSO ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
ORGANISATION HE SERVES AND ARRANGE HIS SERVICES TO MAKE A DEFINABLE
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES. THE
OBJECTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE USED AS PREMISES FOR
DETERMINING WHERE THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTION SHOULD OPERATE AND HOW
ITS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE INFORMATION SERVICE (WHICH CONSISTS OF 3
SECTIONS, A LIBRARY, TRANSLATION BUREAU AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION) OF THE
SOUTH AFRICAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION (ISCOR) IS USED AS A
WORKING EXAMPLE. THE USE OF MBO BY ISC OR IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND THE
OBJECTIVES OF ISCOR AND ITS GENERAL MANAGER ARE MENTIONED. FROM THESE
OBJECTIVES AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY ARE DERIVED AND IDENTIFIED IN THE FORM OF
THE DIFFERENT ISCOR DEPARTMENTS.
LIBRARIANS AS POLITICAL ACTIVISTS.
     
DESCRIBES HOW LIBRARIANS AT BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA SUCCEEDED IN ENABLING THEIR
LIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN THEIR POSITIONS, OR EVEN GROW, IN SPITE OF THE GENERAL
SHRINKAGE OF LOCAL BUDGETS IN THE STATE. THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE
INFLUENCE OF DIRECT POLITICAL ACTION AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL.
GERMAN LIBRARIES' THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
     
LECTURE GIVEN TO A MEETING OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN BERLIN. GERMANS ARE
PROUD OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION IN SPEECH AND IN
WRITING, YET THIS VERY FREEDOM CAN CAUSE CONFUSION. SINCE INFORMATION CAN BE
UNSCRUPULOUSLY MANIPULATED A RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE MUST BE MAINTAINED.
INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION FOR STOCK PURCHASE AND LOANS IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP
COSTS DOWN. LIBRARIES OFTEN RANK LOW IN LISTS OF CULTURAL PRIORITIES OWING TO
A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND A LACK OF PUBLIC INTEREST;
MARKET ECONOMY CRITERIA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM. THE PROVISION OF
INFORMATION AND LITERATURE MUST BE PLANNED RATIONALLY. MANY LIBRARIES HAVE HAD
TO ACCEPT CUTS IN THEIR BUDGETS ALTHOUGH THE PRICES OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS
HAVE RISEN; COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE BOOK TRADE MUST BE IMPROVED.
LIBRARY NEWS.COVE
     
RS SOME OF THE MAJOR ITEMS OF U.S. NATIONAL NEWS AFFECTING LIBRARY FUNDING AND
SUPPORT DURING 1980.
THE FINANCING OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCING METHODS FOR SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS
SKETCHED, FROM THE SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY TO THE PARTNERSHIP SYSTEM IN WHICH
COSTS OF LOCAL LIBRARIES ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARY SERVICES
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE VARIOUS APPROACHES FOLLOWED IN THE 4 SOUTH
AFRICAN PROVINCES ARE INDICATED. A GREAT NEED EXISTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON
THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE LARGE CITIES
ESPECIALLY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FINANCING.
SOME PROMISES KEPT' THE PETERBOROUGH TOWN LIBRARY.
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN PETERBOROUGH, NEW HAMPSHIRE,
THE OLDEST TAX-SUPPORTED LIBRARY IN THE WORLD. DESCRIBES THE FINANCING OF THE
LIBRARY SINCE ITS FOUNDATION IN 1833, AND DISCUSSES ITS BUDGET FOR 1981,
APPROXIMATELY 80% OF WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY TAX SUPPORT.
ZZZZ.
     
DESCRIBES THE CAMPAIGN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIANS IN VIRGINIA TO INCREASE STATE AID
WITH THE HELP OF A LOBBYIST. THE GREATEST VICTORY WAS THE CREATION OF A JOINT
SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE FUNDING OF LIBRARIES.
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'FREE' PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THEIR AUTHORITIES, IN COMPETITION
WITH OTHER MORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ORIGINATED IN THE UK
DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THEIR MAIN FUNCTION BEING THE UPLIFTING
OF THE UNEDUCATED. TODAY PUBLIC LIBRARIES MAINLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SUPPLYING
OF LIGHT READING MATTER, ESPECIALLY NOVELS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE, FROM A
LITERARY POINT OF VIEW, OF A DUBIOUS NATURE. THE ARGUMENTS USED DURING THE
LAST CENTURY TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SERVICES ARE NO LONGER VALID
TODAY. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE NEITHER FULLY PART OF
THE WORLD OF EDUCATION NOR THE WORLD OF RECREATION, WITH THE RESULT THAT ITS
IMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS OBSCURE. CONSIDERS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONTINUED
FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT IS
NECESSARY, NO VALID OBJECTION CAN BE FOUND TO CHARG E USERS FOR THOSE SERVICES
WHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE AIMS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY PURSUES.
CAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES STILL AFFORD FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES?.
     
THE VIEWS THAT VARIOUS MEMBERS OF A SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNITY MAY HAVE ON THE
PROVISION OF A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY ARE
EXPLORED. IDENTIFIES 3 GROUPS OF LIBRARY USERS' RATE-PAYER/LIBRARY MEMBERS,
RESIDENT NON-RATEPAYERS AND NON-RESIDENT LIBRARY MEMBERS, AND LOOKS AT THE
JUSTIFICATION FOR A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE TO EACH GROUP. HE CONCLUDES THAT THE
1ST GROUP IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE GIVEN A FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICE BY A LOCAL AUTHORITY.
A COMPARISON BETWEEN MOBILE AND STATIONARY LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS WITH
REFERENCE TO COSTS AND PERFORMANCE.
     
THERE IS STILL DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER MOBILE OR STATIONARY LIBRARIES
PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE FOR RURAL AREAS WITH POPULATIONS UNDER 5,000. MOBILE
LIBRARIES PERMIT FLEXIBLE ORGANISATION AND CAN COME CLOSE TO USERS' HOMES;
THEY ARE OPERATED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO BRING A LARGE AND VARIED BOOK
STOCK SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL RESERVES. SINCE THEY ARE ONLY IN 1 PLACE FOR A
SHORT TIME, HOWEVER, THEY CANNOT EASILY BECOME CULTURAL CENTRES. SMALL
STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS HAVE SMALL, RESTRICTED STOCKS AND
ARE RARELY SERVED BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF. A COMPARISON OF INITIAL AND RUNNING
COSTS FOR MOBILE AND SMALL STATIONARY BRANCH LIBRARIES IN MIDDLE FRANCONIA
REVEALS THAT MOBILE LIBRARY PROVISION IS THE CHEAPER METHOD AND A COMPARISON
OF PERFORMANCES, THAT IT IS THE MORE EFFICIENT.
LIBRARY SERVICE IN GREAT BRITAIN' STANDING FAST.
     
EXAMINES THE EFFECT ON LIBRARIES IN THE UK OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS. COMPARES THE SITUATION IN TOWER HAMLETS AND
LANCASHIRE, WHERE DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN LIBRARY SPENDING HAVE TAKEN PLACE,
WITH THAT IN CAMDEN, WHERE SPENDING HAS NOT BEEN CUT, BUT WHERE RATEPAYERS ARE
HAVING TO BEAR AN INCREASING LEVEL OF TAXATION FOR LIBRARIES AND OTHER
SERVICES. DESCRIBES HOW PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME IN 2 AUTHORITIES' IN
SUTTON WHERE REVENUE-RAISING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VIDEO GAMES HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCED; AND IN BRENT, WHERE THE COMMUNITY BASED LIBRARY SERVICE, BECAUSE
OF ITS MAJOR COMMITMENT TO OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMES HAS BEEN
TREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. NOTES THE RESPONSE OF THE
UNIONS AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO THE SPENDING CUTS.
THE CULTURAL POLICY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
     
THE TEXT OF A TALK GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARIES IN THE ICY WIND OF
CULTURAL POLICY, HELD IN JARFALLA, MAY 81. IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE CULTURAL
POLICY THE CULTURAL PRODUCERS MUST INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE WHOLE SPHERE OF
LOCAL POLITICS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,
AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED. AFTER THE BOOM IN THE 60S AND 70S, THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES HAVE TO MAKE CUTS; AS THEY CANNOT REDUCE PREVIOUS CAPITAL
INVESTMENT THEY CUT CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS
AND LIBRARIES, ALTHOUGH MONEY SEEMS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR SPORT, BUREAUCRACY
AND DATA TECHNOLOGY. THE REAL POWER OF DECISION-MAKING LIES NOT WITH THE
CULTURAL, BUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUDGETING.
CULTURAL CONSUMERS SHOULD BE AS POLITICALLY ACTIVE AS THE PRESSURE GROUPS FOR
SPORT AND TRY TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POLITICIANS,  IF A CATASTROPHE FOR CULTURE IS
TO BE AVERTED.
ZERO-BASE BUDGETING FOR LIBRARIES' A SECOND LOOK.
     
ZERO-BASE BUDGETING (ZBB) WAS GIVEN CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT
LITERATURE DURING THE LATTER 1970S. ZBB OFFERS MANY CONCEPTS AND BUDGETING
TECHNIQUES THAT MAY PROVE ESPECIALLY USEFUL TO LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN THE
BUDGET-TIGHT 1980S. INCLUDES A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE KEY FEATURES OF ZBB AS A
BUDGETING/PLANNING SYSTEM, A DISCUSSION OF THE APPLICATIONS OF ZBB REPORTED IN
THE LITERATURE, AND A SUMMARY OF THE SPECIAL BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS FOR
LIBRARIES THAT USE OF CONCEPTS DERIVED FROM ZBB, IF NOT ZBB ITSELF, MIGHT
PROVIDE.
FUTURE LIBRARIES' THE ELECTRONIC ENVIRONMENT.
     
ARGUES THAT THE LIBRARY, AND ITS ABILITY TO HANDLE INFORMATION EFFICIENTLY
COULD WELL BE AT THE CENTRE OF CHANGE AS THE NEW ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY BEGINS
TO HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. CONCLUDES THAT
ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY HOLDS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE LIBRARY A MORE
HUMANISTIC INSTITUTION BY ROUTINISING JOBS FORMERLY DONE BY PROFESSIONALS,
THEREBY MAKING THE LIBRARY MORE EFFICIENT AND FREEING THESE PROFESSIONALS TO
INTERACT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE USERS OF INFORMATION.
DEVELOPING COMPUTER-BASED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
     
AIMS TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL GUIDANCE FOR THE LIBRARIAN, UNTRAINED IN SYSTEMS
DEVELOPMENT AND POSSIBLY UNFAMILIAR WITH COMPUTERS, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
DEVELOPING A COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM.
AUTOMATION OF LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSES ON THE PAGES OF PROFESSIONAL
PUBLICATIONS IN THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES.
     
ACHIEVEMENTS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE REVIEWED ON THE
BASIS OF PUBLISHED MATERIALS. ASPECTS COVERED ARE' DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERISED
DATA BASES IN LIBRARIES, COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, ACQUISITION SYSTEMS
AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS APPLIED IN LIBRARIES IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES.
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSING IS AN AREA WHERE COMPUTERS HAVE MOST OFTEN BEEN
UTILISED. SEVERAL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING MARC, AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SERVICES AND ON-LINE SYSTEMS ARE MENTIONED. COOPERATION CONNECTED WITH THE USE
OF COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES AND THE RESULTING ECONOMICALLY EFFECTIVE PROCESSING
ARE FACTORS OF A GREAT INTEREST TO SOVIET LIBRARIANS.
MARKS OF INSUFFICIENCY: LESSONS OF A MEETING AND OF A THEMATIC ISSUE OF A
JOURNAL.
     
THE PROFESSIONAL MEETING HELD IN AUTUMN 81 IN KECSKEMET AND THE THEMATIC ISSUE
OF THE PERIODICAL INFORMACIO/ELEKTRONIKA (16 (5) 1981) DEALING WITH LIBRARY
MECHANISATION HAVE RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING HUNGARIAN
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION. THE PROBLEMS RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THE
DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS AND FROM THE DRAWING UP OF CATALOGUES FOLLOWING FROM
THEM. ON THE BASIS OF THEIR EXAMINATION, POINTS TO THE FACTS HINDERING
DEVELOPMENT' FOREIGN RESULTS OF AUTOMATION ARE TAKEN OVER WITH DIFFICULTY;
LIBRARY MECHANISATION IS UNCOORDINATED; THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION IS
UNDEVELOPED AND TERMINOLOGY IS NOT CLEAR.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL EIGHTIES.
     
THE HISTORY OF COMPUTERISATION IN THE EAST LONDON PUBLIC LIBRARY (SOUTH
AFRICA) IS OUTLINED. AN EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT STATUS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM
IS DATED IN RELATION TO NEW TECHNOLOGY. A CHANGE TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM IS
FORESEEN. SINCE AACR2 AND SAMARC WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL
COMPUTERISATION, THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEM-A FACTOR THAT
WILL AFFECT COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE NETWORK. THE
POSSIBLE USE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES OF COMPUTERS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES, SUCH AS READING AIDS FOR THE BLIND, IS DISCUSSED AND PUBLIC
LIBRARIANS ARE URGED TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING AND ENTERPRISING IN ADOPTING
INNOVATIONS.
AUTOMATION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE UNILEVER RESEARCH LABORATORY IN VLAARDINGEN.
     
THE LIBRARY OF THE UNILEVER RESEARCH LABORATORY AT VLAARDINGEN IN THE
NETHERLANDS SERVES APPROXIMATELY 450 LABORATORY STAFF. THE COLLECTION CONTAINS
SOME 10,000 BOOKS AND 800 CURRENT PERIODICALS, COVERING EDIBLE OILS AND FATS
AND SOAP PRODUCTS, AND HAS A STAFF OF 7. AT PRESENT THE PRODUCTION OF THE
ANNUAL PERIODICALS LIST, THE SDI OF NEW PERIODICAL ARTICLES, THE PERIODICALS
ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONTROL OF THE LIBRARY BUDGET ARE CARRIED OUT ON THE
LABORATORY'S MINI-COMPUTER, TO WHICH THE LIBRARY IS LINKED BY MEANS OF A
VISUAL DISPLAY UNIT. IN ADDITION, THE BOOK CATALOGUE IS PRODUCED ON MICROFICHE
USING THE HEADQUARTERS COMPUTER IN ROTTERDAM. IN THE NEAR FUTURE IT IS PLANNED
TO AUTOMATE THE LOAN SYSTEM AND THE BOOK-ORDERING AND INVOICE SYSTEM.
MALMO CITY LIBRARY-MOST ASSIDUOUS USER OF TELETYPE WITHIN LIBRIS.
     
NOW THAT THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES' INFORMATION SYSTEM LIBRIS HAS BEEN
TRANSFERRED TO A NEW CENTRAL COMPUTER THE POSSIBILITY OF USING TELETYPE (TTY)
CONNECTIONS TO THE LIBRIS SYSTEM IS OPEN TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARY BESIDES THOSE
ALREADY LINKED TO LIBRIS. TTY ENABLES SEARCHING OF THE LIBRIS DATA BASE, WHICH
CONTAINS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA ON NEW ACQUISITIONS IN SWEDISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES
SINCE THE END OF THE 1960S. EACH REGISTERED BOOK TITLE IN LIBRIS HAS ITS OWN
OBJECT NUMBER AND CAN BE PRESENTED IN UP TO 5 DIFFERENT TRANSACTION PICTURES
WITH DIFFERENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA, FROM VERY FEW DATA IDENTIFYING AND LOCATING
THE OBJECT, TO A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION. CATALOGUE CARDS TO SUIT THE INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARY'S PRACTICE OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION CAN BE ORDERED.
AUTOMATION AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE SPHERE OF NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. DUE TO AUTOMATION THE LAST DECADE WAS A PERIOD
OF MANY CHANGES FOR MOST SWEDISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE DEVELOPMENT AND
FUNCTIONS OF SWEDEN'S 2 AUTOMATED SYSTEMS-LIBRIS AND BUMS-ARE DESCRIBED AND
PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEW CATALOGUING RULES MENTIONED.
THE NEW RULES WERE ADOPTED BY THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE FOR USE IN
CENTRALISED CATALOGUING IN 1975 AND IN 1977 FOR THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. IN
1978 THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY WAS AUTOMATED AND BECAME AVAILABLE FOR
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL EXCHANGE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.
FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF NETWORKING AND RESOURCE SHARING.
     
LIBRARY COOPERATIVES WILL EVOLVE MORE INTO AUTOMATED LIBRARY NETWORKS WHICH
ARE GENERALLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE, LESS LABOUR-INTENSIVE, AND PROVIDE MORE AND
BETTER SERVICE. THE MORE SUCCESSFUL US NETWORKS ARE THOSE WHERE THE MEMBER
LIBRARIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT WITH FUNDS FROM THEIR LOCAL LIBRARIES'
OPERATING BUDGETS AND WHICH VIEW THE SERVICES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR
ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS. COST-EFFECTIVE NETWORKS ARE CHARACTERISED BY GREATER
COMPETITION, LESS STATE AND FEDERAL CONTROL, AND MORE RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT. THE NETWORK'S ECONOMIC REVOLUTION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS
BEGINNING TO OCCUR WHERE AUTOMATED NETWORKS HAVE EXTENDED SERVICES DIRECTLY TO
THE USERS IN THEIR HOMES.
COMPUTERTOWN, USA! USING PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
     
.COMPUTERTOWN, USA IS A COMPUTER LITERACY PROJECT FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL
SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND BASED AT MENLO PARK PUBLIC LIBRARY, CALIFORNIA. 5 SMALL
PERSONAL COMPUTERS ARE INSTALLED IN THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY AND AT VARIOUS
TIMES THE LIBRARY HOLDS COMPUTER CLASSES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS, SPECIAL
COMPUTER AWARENESS WORKSHOPS FOR THE COMMUNITY AND A PROGRAMME THAT PROVIDES
OPEN ACCESS TO COMPUTERS FOR ANYONE WHO COMES INTO THE LIBRARY. THE HARDWARE
CONSISTS OF 3 COMMODORE PETS, A RADIO SHACK TRS-80 AND AN ATARI 400 HOOKED TO
A COLOUR TV.
STALKING MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE.
     
WHEN PONTIAC HIGH SCHOOL'S MEDIA CENTRE PURCHASED A MICROCOMPUTER, THEY
ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS IN LOCATING SUITABLE PROGRAMS. A LIST OF PROGRAMS FINALLY
LOCATED IS GIVEN WITH DETAILS OF THE MANUFACTURERS AND NOTES ON USE. THE
ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN SOFTWARE PACKAGES ON APPROVAL, IN THE SAME WAY AS OTHER
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS, WAS NOT TOTALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT 28 PROGRAMS OUT OF THE
37 REQUESTED WERE AVAILABLE FOR PREVIEW. SUGGESTS THAT THE REASONS FOR
WITHOLDING APPROVAL MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEWNESS OF THE EDUCATIONAL
MARKET COUPLED WITH FEARS OF COPYRIGHT ABUSE.
MINIS & MICROS-SMALLER COMPUTERS FOR SMALLER LIBRARIES.
     
PARTIAL PROCEEDINGS OF A CONFERENCE HELD BY THE SCOTTISH SECTION OF THE
COLLEGES OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION GROUP OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN
EDINBURGH, 5 DEC 79. AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT COMPUTERS ARE NO LONGER THE
PRESERVE OF BIG LIBRARIES AND TO INVESTIGATE IN PARTICULAR THEIR USE BY
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN MECHANISING THEIR IN-HOUSE DATA BASES AND IN ASSISTING IN
THE CONTROL OF MINI SYSTEMS OR SUBSYSTEMS IN THE LIBRARY'S MANAGEMENT; FOR
EXAMPLE, RESERVE BOOK COLLECTIONS, SUBJECT DIVISIONS OF BUDGETS, AND
NEWSLETTERS. INCLUDES LIST OF SUPPLIERS OF PACKAGED INFORMATION HANDLING
SYSTEMS AND OUTLINES OF THE BIRMINGHAM LIBRARIES COOPERATIVE MECHANISATION
PROJECT (BLCMP) AND THE SOUTH WEST ACADEMIC LIBRARIES COOPERATIVE AUTOMATION
PROJECT (SWALCAP).
BURNOUT' FROM A LIBRARIAN'S PERSPECTIVE.
     
INTENDED TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON LIBRARIANS' NEEDS REGARDING COPING WITH MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL OCCUPATIONAL STRESS, THIS REPORT SUMMARISES THE ACTIVITIES OF A
WORKSHOP ON THE CONCERNS OF LIBRARIAN INSTRUCTORS HELD IN 1979 BY THE
CALIFORNIA CLEARINGHOUSE ON LIBRARY INSTRUCTION (CCLI); DISCUSSES THE VARIOUS
DEFINITIONS OF BURNOUT; AND PRESENTS A SELECTIVE, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
WORKS ON (1) TEACHER/LIBRARIAN BURNOUT, STRESS, AND JOB SATISFACTION; (2)
BURNOUT AND STRESS IN OTHER PROFESSIONS; AND (3) MISCELLANEOUS WORKS ABOUT
BURNOUT. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
KBF HAS GOT 10,000 (KRONER) TOWARDS A PILOT PROJECT ON WORK ENVIRONMENT AND
AUTOMATION.
     
IN JUNE 80 THE NORWEGIAN MINISTRY OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS AND EMPLOYMENT GRANTED
THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS (KBF) FUNDS FOR A PILOT PROJECT
TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE GROUNDS FOR MORE EXTENDED RESEARCH ON WORK
ENVIRONMENT, AUTOMATION AND THE LIBRARY. THE ASSOCIATION HAS POINTED OUT THAT
PREVIOUS REPORTS ON COMPUTERISATION IN LIBRARIES IGNORED PROBLEMS OF WORKING
CONDITIONS AND EMPLOYMENT, AND THAT THE EMPLOYEES' ORGANISATIONS SHOULD TAKE
THE INITIATIVE IN INVESTIGATING THEM. THEY AIM TO CHART PROBLEMS ARISING FROM
THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION IN (1) WORKING CONDITIONS-PHYSICAL, JOB
STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT, STAFF/READER RELATIONS; (2) POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF
EMPLOYEES ON PLANNING AND INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS; (3) EMPLOYMENT AND
FINANCE' WILL AUTOMATION FREE STAFF FOR OTHER WORK OR LEAD TO DISMISSALS? AND
WILL THE EXPENSE OF COMPUTERISATION MEAN CUTS IN OTHER ASPECTS OF LIBRAR Y
SERVICE?.
SERIALS DEPARTMENT STAFFING PATTERNS IN MEDIUM SIZED RESEARCH LIBRARIES.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF SERIALS DEPARTMENT STAFFING IN MEDIUM
SIZED US RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THIS SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE' HOW
MANY OF THESE LIBRARIES HAVE ORGANISED SOME OF ALL OF THEIR SERIALS RELATED
ACTIVITIES INTO AN INTEGRATED SERIALS DEPARTMENT; OF THE LIBRARIES THAT HAVE A
SERIALS DEPARTMENT, WHICH TASKS DO THEY HANDLE; AND WHAT LEVEL OF PERSONNEL
ARE CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THESE TASKS. COMBINES THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY WITH
AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE JOBS PERFORMED IN THE SERIAL DEPARTMENT
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO LIBRARY.
PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION IN LIBRARIES.
     
COVERS MANY ASPECTS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT IN USA LIBRARIES. CHAPTERS
INCLUDE' THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF PERSONNEL BY ARTHUR CURLEY; STAFFING PATTERNS
IN LIBRARIES BY MARGARET MYERS; PERSONNEL PLANNING AND UTILISATION BY SHEILA
CRETH; RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION BY BILLY R. WILKINSON; LABOR RELATIONS BY
FREDERICK DUDA; STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINUING EDUCATION BY SHEILA CRETH;
PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL IN LIBRARIES' PURPOSE AND TECHNIQUES BY MAXINE RENEKER;
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BY JENERCE GUY.
WHAT TO DO UNTIL THE LAWYER COMES...AND AFTER.
     
ADVICE TO SENIOR LIBRARIANS WHO FIND THEMSELVES DISMISSED ON THE COURSE OF
ACTION THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN, ADVICE THAT MAY BE GIVEN BY LAWYERS AND SOME OF
THE PITFALLS THAT MAY EXIST.
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT IN LIBRARIES.
     
EXPLORES THE FACTORS THAT MOTIVATE THE MEMBERS OF LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL STAFF
TO PERFORM THEIR FUNCTION OF ACCUMULATION, PRESERVATION AND DISSEMINATION OF
KNOWLEDGE. PART I DEALS WITH THEORETICAL FORMULATIONS OF HOW TO MOTIVATE STAFF
TO WORK MOST EFFICIENTLY AND PART II DEALS WITH PUTTING THESE THEORIES INTO
PRACTICE AND EVALUATING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TRAINING AND THE EDUCATIONAL LIBRARY.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY TRAINING. CALLS FOR THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF 10-12 LIBRARIES, EMBODYING ALL IMPORTANT TYPES OF LIBRARY, IN
WHICH HUNGARIAN LIBRARY STUDENTS WOULD PERFORM ALL THEIR OBLIGATORY
PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE. THESE LIBRARIES COULD SET THE TOPICS OF STUDENT THESES
AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MODIFICATION OF THE CURRICULUM. THE
MOST OUTSTANDING SPECIALISTS IN THE LIBRARIES COULD LECTURE STUDENTS ON THE
USE OF MODERN LIBRARY METHODS IN THE LIBRARIES.
PROMOTING IN-SERVICE TRAINING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM
(DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) FOR A SCHEME OF IN-SERVICE
TRAINING FOR DUTCH LIBRARIANS THE NBLC IN 1977 CREATED A DEPARTMENT TO PROMOTE
THE ACQUISITION OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE BY PRACTISING LIBRARIANS. THE
DEPARTMENT OFFERS COURSES ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS THE HANDLING OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS, AUTOMATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, CHILDREN'S STORY HOURS, AND
CATALOGUING. THE COURSES ARE GIVEN BY NBLC STAFF WITH THE HELP OF PRACTISING
LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY SCHOOL LECTURERS AND LAST FROM 5 TO 10 DAYS. IN ORDER
TO RELATE THE SYLLABUS TO PRACTICAL LIBRARY SITUATIONS STUDENTS' PRACTICAL
EXPERIENCES ARE USED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE THEORETICAL ASPECTS
OF THE COURSES. THE NBLC PLANS TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS.
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
REPORT ON THE ADVANCED TRAINING SEMINAR ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA PROVISION IN LIBRARIES HELD BY THE BAVARIAN SECTION OF THE
VEREIN DER BIBLIOTHEKARE AN OFFENTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF
LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES) OCT 81. TOPICS COVERED INCLUDED' FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MEDIA MARKET, WITH REFERENCE TO THE RADIO EXHIBITION IN
BERLIN; COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES; PROBLEMS CAUSED BY POP MUSIC IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES; DEVELOPMENT OF
MEDIA CENTRES IN THE PUBLIC AND GRAMMAR SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN HERZOGENAURACH;
AND TELECOMMUNICATION IN LIBRARIES AND THE RELEVANCE OF NEW COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS FOR SMALL LIBRARIES.
LIBRARIAN PERFORMANCE IN DATA PROCESSING CENTRES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 14TH BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON INFORMATICS AND LIBRARY
SCIENCE, SAO PAULO, 16-23 OCT 81, DESCRIBING INTERACTION BETWEEN LIBRARIANS
AND DATA PROCESSING PROFESSIONALS AT THE ENGINEERING SCHOOL DATA PROCESSING
CENTRE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF SAO PAULO, AS A MODEL FOR GENERAL APPLICATION IN
BOTH UNIVERSITY AND BUSINESS SETTINGS WHERE LIBRARIANS WORK AS PART OF A TEAM
OF SPECIALISTS. AN ANALYSIS IS PRESENTED OF LIBRARIAN PERFORMANCE IN LIBRARY
OPERATIONS; DOCUMENTATION OF PROJECTS DEVELOPED BY THE CENTRE; SUPPORT
ACTIVITIES FOR SPECIALIST TEAMS; DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS; PERSONNEL TRAINING; AND PUBLICATIONS. DRAWS ATTENTION TO
THE NEED FOR LIBRARY SCHOOLS TO PREPARE LIBRARIANS FOR A COLLABORATIVE ROLE IN
INFORMATION WORK.
THE SACRED COW' LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN.
     
ARGUES THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN IN THE UK SUFFERS FROM THE 2
ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES WHICH CHARACTERISE ITS PROVISION. 1 STRUCTURE SEPARATES
WORK WITH CHILDREN COMPLETELY FROM WORK WITH ADULTS, AND REGARDS IT AS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF SPECIALISTS' THE OTHER ASSUMES, IN CONTRAST, THAT CHILDREN
HAVE NO SPECIFIC NEEDS, AND STAFF NEED NO TRAINING IN DEALING WITH THEM.
ADVOCATES A STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE EXECUTION OF CHILDREN'S WORK IS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY LIBRARY STAFF, TRAINED AND SUPPORTED BY
SPECIALISTS.
WOMEN LIBRARIANS AS INTERPRETERS OF THE VISUAL ARTS.
     
EXAMINES THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN LIBRARIANS WHO PROMOTED PUBLIC
AND SCHOLARLY UNDERSTANDING OF THE VISUAL ARTS. A PRELIMINARY ACCOUNT OF
UNDERLYING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ART MUSEUMS LEADS ON TO A
BRIEF ANALYSIS OF CONDITIONS FAVOURING WOMENS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VISUAL
ARTS. BIOGRAPHICAL EXAMPLES OF WOMEN WHOSE CAREERS DEMONSTRATE ACHIEVEMENT AS
LIBRARIANS AND INTERPRETERS OF THE VISUAL ARTS.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION AS A PROFESSION FOR WOMEN.
     
SURVEYS THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND, THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND UP TO THE 1920S, THE
QUALIFICATIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS REQUIRED OF WOMEN IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, AS WELL AS THEIR PART IN LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. WOMEN FIRST
BECAME ACCEPTED IN LIBRARIANSHIP WHEN THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF MEN
AVAILABLE. THE WOMEN, MOSTLY FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, RUSHED INTO A PROFESSION
WHICH DID NOT DETRACT FROM SOCIAL PRESTIGE. STEREOTYPED IDEAS CONCERNING
FEMALE QUALITIES MADE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE PROFESSION EASIER' ACCURACY,
INDUSTRY, SELF-DENIAL AND SUBORDINATION ON THE ONE HAND; SOCIAL SENSITIVITY,
MOTHERLY FEELING AND INSIGHT INTO PEOPLE'S NATURE ON THE OTHER. THE GROWING
NUMBER OF WOMEN IN LIBRARIANSHIP MADE AN ORGAN FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR
INTERESTS DESIRABLE. THE 'VEREINIGUNG BIBLIOTEKARISCH ARBEITENDER FRAUEN',
FOUNDED IN 1907, MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PAYMENT, INFORM INTERESTED PEOPLE
ABOUT THE PROFESSION AND ABOUT ED UCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, AND PROVIDED AN
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY. THE ASSOCIATION WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE 'REICHSVERBAND
DEUTSCHER BIBLIOTHEKSBEAMTER UND-ANGESTELLTER' IN 1920.
MORNINGTON PENINSULA REPORT.
     
REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA. THE AUTHOR
VISITED 85 SCHOOLS IN THE MORNINGTON PENINSULA AREA (JUST SOUTH OF MELBOURNE),
QUESTIONING THEIR LIBRARIANS ON HOW THE STAFF AND PRINCIPAL VIEW THE ROLE OF
THE LIBRARY AND TEACHER-LIBRARIAN IN THE SCHOOL, THE BASIC ROLE OF THE
TEACHER-LIBRARIAN, MAIN PROBLEMS, QUALIFICATIONS, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR
WORKSHOPS, SEMINARS, OR STUDY COURSES. PRESENTS THE RESPONSES, WITH
EXPLANATORY NOTES.
COGNITIVE STYLE AS AN APPROACH IN PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION.
     
IN A PROJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND RESEARCHERS ARE INVOLVED IN
DETERMINING THE COGNITIVE STYLES OF INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS AND RELATING
COGNITIVE STYLE TO TASK PERFORMANCE. COGNITIVE STYLE IS A CHARACTERISTIC AND
PERVASIVE MODE OF FUNCTIONING IN BOTH PERCEPTUAL AND INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITIES.
DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF COGNITIVE STYLE AND INDICATES ITS USEFULNESS AS A
MEANS OF ANALYSING PROBLEM-SOLVING OR DECISION-MAKING BEHAVIOUR. DESCRIBES
SOME COGNITIVE STYLE DIMENSIONS AND MODELS WHICH SEEM USEFUL FOR ANALYSING
INFORMATION SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS AND DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
RESEARCH FOR PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.
EMPHASISES THE MCKENNEY-KEEN MODEL DEVELOPED AT THE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS MODEL FOR DESCRIBING THE COGNITIVE STYLE OF
INFORMATION SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS IS BEING TESTED IN THE MARYLAND PROJECT.
STRATEGIES FOR UPDATING KNOWLEDGE OF REFERENCE RESOURCES AND TECHNIQUES.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS IN LARGE AND
MEDIUM-SIZED PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES TO FIND OUT HOW THEY KEPT UP TO
DATE ON REFERENCE MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES. THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED METHODS
WERE THROUGH PROFESSIONAL READING, STAFF MEETINGS, STAFF SHARING AND
CONFERENCES/WORKSHOPS.
BURNOUT AT THE REFERENCE DESK.
     
BURNOUT IS DEFINED AS A SYNDROME OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION
INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE JOB ATTITUDES AND LOSS OF CONCERN FOR
CLIENTS. DISCUSSES THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS TO BURNOUT, THE
SYMPTOMS AND SUGGESTED REMEDIES BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AFFLICTED AND
CO-WORKERS/MANAGERS.
THE COGNITIVE STYLE OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS.
     
REPORTS ON RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THE COGNITIVE STYLE OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS
ON THE FIELD DEPENDENCE/FIELD INDEPENDENCE DIMENSION AND TO RELATE COGNITIVE
STYLE TO PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS ROLE PERCEPTION, TYPE OF
LIBRARY AFFILIATION AND GRADUATE QUALIFICATION. COGNITIVE STYLE IS DEFINED AS
A PERSON'S HABITUAL METHOD OF FUNCTIONING IN PERCEPTUAL AND INTELLECTUAL
ACTIVITIES AND FIELD DEPENDENCE/INDEPENDENCE CLASSIFIES PEOPLE ACCORDING TO
THEIR TENDENCY TO VIEW AN OBJECT AS INTEGRATED WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS.
REFERENCE LIBRARIANS WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES QUALIFICATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE THE
MOST FIELD DEPENDENT GROUP AND THOSE WITH ARTS AND SCIENCE QUALIFICATIONS WERE
FOUND TO BE THE MOST FIELD INDEPENDENT.
NEW BUILDING AND MECHANISATION OF THE CITY LIBRARY, ROTTERDAM.
     
IN 1983, THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF THE CITY LIBRARY, ROTTERDAM WILL MOVE TO A NEW
BUILDING. DESCRIBES THE PREPARATION AND PLANNING FOR THE MOVE. THE DEVELOPMENT
OF A RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION IS ALSO IN PROGRESS.
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF LIBRARIES.
     
IN NOV 81, THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STANDARDISATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AND EQUIPMENT OF LIBRARIES WAS HELD IN PRAGUE. ADAPTATION OF BUILDINGS FOR
LIBRARY SERVICES AS WELL AS WORKING TECHNIQUES IN LIBRARIES WERE ALSO ON THE
AGENDA. 57 PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONFERENCE CAME FROM 8 SOCIALIST COUNTRIES,
INCLUDING CUBA AND VIETNAM. LECTURES AND DISCUSSIONS WERE COMPLEMENTED BY
VISITS TO THE CZECH STATE LIBRARY AND TO THE PATENTS LIBRARY. THE PURPOSE OF
THE CONFERENCE WAS NOT ONLY TO DISCUSS THE LATEST INFORMATION BUT ALSO TO
OUTLINE PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE, AND TO ENCOURAGE CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN
THE COMECON COUNTRIES. IT WAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT EXPANSION OF LIBRARIES
MUST NOT BE HAMPERED BY THE INEVITABLE ECONOMIC CRITERIA. THE TECHNICAL CENTRE
FOR CZECHOSLOVAK LIBRARIES IN PRAGUE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST, AND IT
WAS SUGGESTED THAT SIMILAR ESTABLISHMENTS BE SET UP IN ALL SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES.
LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION IN AUSTRIA.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURED LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. REVIEWS THE CURRENT SITUATION IN LIBRARY PLANNING AND DESIGN IN
AUSTRIA. SEVERAL SEMINARS DEVOTED TO THE SUBJECT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN RECENT
YEARS AND AUSTRIAN SPECIALISTS ALSO PARTICIPATED IN SIMILAR CONFERENCES
ABROAD. MAIN PROJECTS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION, EXTENSION AND NEW BUILDINGS ARE
PRESENTED FOR BOTH RESEARCH AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES, COMPRISING BOOK STORAGE
FACILITIES, READING ROOMS, AND OFFICE ACCOMMODATION. MAJOR UNDERTAKINGS OF THE
RECENT YEARS WERE THOSE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY NEUE HOFBURG WING, VIENNA
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND THE GRAZ, INNSBRUCK AND SALZBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
A NEW HOSPITAL LIBRARY IN SAN DIEGO' PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION.
     
A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL CENTER, SAN
DIEGO, PROVIDES 7,100 SQ. FT., SEATING FOR 100 READERS, AND A STOCK CAPACITY
OF 23,000 VOLUMES. THE BUILDING CONTAINS 3 SPLIT-LEVEL FLOORS WITH
CONVENTIONAL REFERENCE AND CIRCULATION SERVICES, A COMBINATION OF GROUP AND
SINGLE SEATING, RAPID COPYING MACHINES, AUDIO-VISUAL FACILITIES, A PUBLIC
ELEVATOR AND AN ELECTRONIC SECURITY SYSTEM FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS. THE LIBRARY, INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE USE OF HEALTH CARE
PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS IN THEIR 3RD AND 4TH YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL,
SERVES A TEACHING HOSPITAL AND ITS ASSOCIATED RESEARCH FACILITIES.
LIBRARY ACCESS FOR THE HANDICAPPED' A GUIDE TO MATERIALS, SERVICES AND
PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY OF PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN THE NEW YORK
METROPOLITAN AREA.
     
THE DIRECTORY COVERS PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.
FOR EACH ENTRY, INFORMATION IS GIVEN UNDER THE HEADINGS; SPECIAL EQUIPMENT,
SPECIAL MATERIALS, SERVICES AND ACCESSIBILITY.
THE ABCS OF REMODELING/ENLARGING AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY BUILDING' A PERSONAL
STATEMENT.
     
A BRIEF LISTING OF THE FACTORS THAT PROBABLY WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE SIZE
AND NATURE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY BUILDINGS FOR INEXPERIENCED BUILDING PLANNERS.
BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE TYPICAL KEY CONDITIONS THAT MAKE A BUILDING INELIGIBLE
FOR REMODELLING AND ENLARGING AND PRESENTS STEPS USEFUL IN ANALYSING A
BUILDING FOR REMODELLING OR FOR REPLACEMENT. GIVES EXAMPLES OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF NORTHERN IOWA, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH ALABAMA, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT
SANTA BARBARA AND BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY.
MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS, SOMETHING FOR HARD TIMES' LIBRARY, KINDERGARTEN,
BRIDGE-CLUB ETC.
     
62% OF NORWEGIAN BRANCH LIBRARIES SERVE POPULATIONS UNDER 1000, 97% ARE
SMALLER THAN THE RECOMMENDED MINIMUM OF 100 SQ.M., AND 80% OPEN 6 HOURS OR
LESS PER WEEK. THERE IS NEED FOR A MASSIVE LIBRARY BUILDING PROGRAMME, OR,
MORE REALISTICALLY, COOPERATION WITH SIMILARLY PLACED ORGANISATIONS. ALREADY
18% OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHARE PREMISES WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND 20% WITH
OFFICES ETC. MULTI-PURPOSE PLANNING MUST RECOGNISE THE NEEDS OF ALL POTENTIAL
USERS AND INVOLVE THEM IN DISCUSSIONS. THE LIBRARY IS TRADITIONALLY USED FOR
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MEETINGS AND CONCERTS. OTHER POSSIBILITIES INCLUDE
COOPERATION WITH NURSERY SCHOOLS, WHICH HAVE SHORT OPENING HOURS IN SPARSELY
POPULATED COMMUNITIES, OR WELFARE SERVICES, WHICH NEED CENTRAL PREMISES.
LIFE STYLE RESEARCH' AN AID TO PROMOTING PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES A LIFE STYLE RESEARCH STUDY OF 423 RESIDENTS AGED 25-64 IN THE
5-COUNTY METROPOLITAN AREA OF COLUMBUS, OHIO, COMMISSIONED BY THE GREAT TRAIB
BROADCASTING COMPANY TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ITS RADIO AUDIENCE. THE
DATA, ANALYSED BY OCLC, SUGGESTS AN APPROACH TO LIBRARY USE PROMOTION THAT
EXPRESSIVELY DEMONSTRATES HOW LIBRARY SERVICES CAN FIT INTO PREEXISTING NEEDS
AND INTERESTS. THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE SHOWN HOW LIBRARY SERVICES CAN HELP TO
SOLVE REAL LIFE PROBLEMS. THE LIFE STYLE VARIABLES CAN HELP PINPOINT THESE
PROBLEMS AND SUGGEST PROMOTIONAL THEMES AND IDEAS.
SCHOOL LIBRARY STAFF ON A SCHOOL TRIP.
     
2 LIBRARY STAFF MEMBERS ACCOMPANIED A CLASS OF 14-YEAR OLDS AND THEIR TEACHERS
FROM A KASSEL COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL ON A HOLIDAY TRIP TO SYLT. THE LIBRARY
STAFF TOOK WITH THEM ABOUT 140 BOOKS ON GAMES, MODELLING, THE IDENTIFICATION
OF SEA CREATURES AND SOME CHILDREN'S FICTION. EVERY EVENING THE CHILDREN AND
TEACHERS USED THESE BOOKS AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE DAY'S ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT
THE LIBRARY STAFF DEVELOPED CLOSE CONTACT WITH SOME TEACHERS AND PUPILS WHO
HAD HITHERTO BEEN SEEN ONLY RARELY IN THE LIBRARY. SOME OF THESE CHILDREN WHO
HAD TENDED TO MISBEHAVE IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY WERE SHOWN TO BETTER ADVANTAGE
IN THE HOLIDAY SITUATION. STORY SESSIONS WERE ALSO ORGANISED AND WERE RECEIVED
ENTHUSIASTICALLY, EVEN BY CHILDREN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY SHOWN LITTLE INTEREST IN
LITERATURE.
EFFICIENCY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WORK IN DISTRICT LIBRARIES.
     
THE STARTING POINT FOR THE FORMULATION OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM MODEL IS THE
INTERACTION BETWEEN BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES AND ITS USER CATEGORIES; THIS TAKES
INTO ACCOUNT USERS' BIBLIOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS, AND MUST ALSO ANTICIPATE THEM
AND STIMULATE THEM IN AGREEMENT WITH BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY'S NEEDS. VERY
IMPORTANT IS THE COOPERATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SERVICES WHICH SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO A WIDER BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM. A STUDY
OF THE ACTUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISTRICT LIBRARIES SHOWED, HOWEVER, SOME
SHORTCOMINGS.
DATA/DIRECT INFORMATION-DATA DOCUMENTATION.
     
DATA IS ALSO DESCRIBED AS NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; QUANTITATIVE DATA OR
TEXTUAL DATA. HANDLING, TYPES AND SOURCES OF SUCH DATA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. DATA INDEXING IN
DOCUMENTATION IS POSSIBLE BY INDICATIVE (FLAG) AND MORE DETAILED (TAG)
INDICATORS. EXAMPLES JUSTIFY THE NECESSITY OF STRENGTHENING THE LINK BETWEEN
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DATA INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.
THE INFORMATION BROKERS' HOW TO START AND OPERATE YOUR OWN FEE-BASED SERVICE.
     
A PRACTICAL GUIDE EXPLAINING THE BASIS OF SETTING UP AN INFORMATION BROKER
BUSINESS AND SHOWING HOW ONE CAN BEGIN AN OPERATION. THE POTENTIAL
ENTREPRENEUR IS TAKEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BECOMING AN INFORMATION
BROKER-FROM CONDUCTING AN INITIAL MARKET STUDY IN THE COMMUNITY, TO SETTING UP
AN OFFICE, AND GETTING AND KEEPING CLIENTS.
INFORMATION BROKERS/FREE-LANCE LIBRARIANS' AN ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE.
     
EXAMINES THE PROFESSION OF INFORMATION BROKERAGE THROUGH A LOOK AT TYPES OF
SERVICES PROVIDED, AND THROUGH A DISCUSSION OF MAJOR ISSUES, INCLUDING THAT OF
USER FEES. THE TYPES OF INFORMATION BROKER AND FREE-LANCE LIBRARIAN SERVICES
ARE IDENTIFIED' (1) NON-PROFIT REFERENCE AND RESEARCH SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS' (2) LARGE FOR-PROFIT REFERENCE
ORGANISATIONS WHICH PROVIDE A VARIETY OF INFORMATION SERVICES, SUCH AS THE
GATHERING, ORGANISATION, PACKAGING, AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION' (3)
MAJOR FOR-PROFIT BUSINESSES WHICH PRODUCE SUCH INFORMATION PRODUCTS AS INDEXES
AND CURRENT AWARENESS PACKAGES' AND (4) SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE INDIVIDUAL
FREE-LANCE LIBRARIAN. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES ARE
TRACED WITH REFERENCE TO REPRESENTATIVE INFORMATION CONSULTING SERVICES AND
ORGANISATIONS. ISSUES VIEWED AS HOLDING MAJOR IMPORTANCE IN THIS PROFESSION
INCLUDE  THE ETHICS OF USER FEES AND CONSEQUENT RAMIFICATIONS ON DEVELOPMENT
OF PAY LIBRARIES, THE ATTITUDE OF SOME LIBRARIANS TOWARD PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT
FOR THE NEW BREED OF INFORMATION WORKER, AND THE CONCEPT OF PROFESSIONALISM AS
IT PERTAINS TO FREE-LANCE LIBRARIANS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ON THE WORK OF THE ADVANCED METHODS SCHOOL FOR INFORMATION WORKERS.
     
DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION AND EXCHANGE OF EXPERIENCES IN THE WORK OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION ORGANS OF THE MINISTRY OF GEOLOGY,
UKRAINIAN SSR.
THE RECORDING OF INFORMATION.
     
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE ACADEMIC GENERAL CENTRAL
LIBRARY IN POTSDAM IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT' TIME-CONSUMING QUERIES SHOULD BE
RECORDED ON SPECIAL FORMS, HERE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL; SELECTED FORMS FOR
ELABORATE QUERIES SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO A KEYWORD CATALOGUE FOR FUTURE
REFERENCE, THE CATALOGUE BEING DIVIDED INTO 2 FILES, 1 FOR TIME-CONSUMING
QUERIES AND 1 FOR BRIEF LITERATURE REFERENCES AND MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION
OFTEN REQUIRED; TOPICS MOST IN DEMAND SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED AND EVERY TOPIC
PUT INTO A CLASSIFIED LIST WHICH CAN THEN BE USED FOR STOCK EXPANSION; AND A
TELEPHONE INFORMATION SERVICE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED.
EXPLOITING PATENT INFORMATION IN INDUSTRY.
     
A SHORT REVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF PATENT LAW LEADS UP TO A DISCUSSION OF RECENT
INTERNATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN REGARD TO PATENT LAW. THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW
RELEVANT TO PATENTS AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED. METHODS OF
FINDING INFORMATION IN PATENTS ARE TREATED, INCLUDING THE CLASSIFICATION OF
PATENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SEARCHING FOR PATENTS. AN INDICATION IS
GIVEN OF THE SPECIAL TRAINING NEEDED BY PERSONS WANTING TO USE PATENTS AS A
SOURCE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
THE REGIONAL AND SUPRAREGIONAL SUPPLY OF LITERATURE IN CONNECTION WITH PATENT
DOCUMENTATION IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.
     
SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTIONS OF PATENT DOCUMENTS AT THE PATENT INSPECTION
CENTRES AND IN THE READING ROOMS IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE GERMAN PATENT OFFICE
IN MUNICH AND ITS BRANCH IN BERLIN, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE TENDENCY TOWARDS
ACHIEVING A COMPLETE COLLECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE
PROBLEMS OF SUPPLYING PATENT LITERATURE AND PATENT DOCUMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN
PATENT OFFICE (EPA) AND THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES ORGANIZATION (WIPO)
ARE DISCUSSED AND NEW CATALOGUING POSSIBILITIES FOR PATENT DOCUMENTS AS A
RESULT OF SERVICES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION CENTRE
(INPADOC) ARE MENTIONED.
DOES CURRENT AFFAIRS DOCUMENTATION INCREASE LIBRARY USE?.
     
IN MODERN SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS THROUGH LIBRARIES TO
INFORMATION ON ALL MATTERS AFFECTING THEIR LIVES. FOR THIS PURPOSE COLLECTIONS
OF MATERIAL RELATING TO MATTERS OF CURRENT, SOCIAL CONCERN SHOULD BE FORMED IN
LOCAL LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, MATERIAL OF THIS NATURE IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
AND TO ORGANISE. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH MATERIAL IS OFTEN
SHORT, THE LIBRARIAN MUST ENSURE THROUGH CAREFUL PUBLICITY THAT THE COLLECTION
IS USED AS HEAVILY AS POSSIBLE. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) PLANS TO
ORGANISE A MEETING IN 1982 FOR LIBRARIANS TO DISCUSS THE ORGANISATION AND
EXPLOITATION OF SUCH COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
THE LIBRARY AS A MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRE' A DANISH EXAMPLE.
     
WITH THE EVER-INCREASING AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION AT NATIONAL AND
LOCAL LEVEL IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL CITIZENS HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT
THEIR RIGHTS AND DUTIES. AT LYNGBY-TAARBAEK IN DENMARK A DEPARTMENT OF
COMMUNITY INFORMATION WAS CREATED IN 1977 TO PROVIDE SUCH A SERVICE. THE
COLLECTION INCLUDES MATERIAL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING, MINUTES OF LOCAL
COUNCIL MEETINGS, AND THE ADDRESSES AND SERVICES OF LOCAL ORGANISATIONS.
EXHIBITIONS ARE HELD ON TOPICS OF CURRENT INTEREST AND A LARGE PART OF THE
COLLECTION IS AVAILABLE FOR LOAN. AT THE START OF THE SERVICE A PUBLICITY
CAMPAIGN WAS HELD WITH ADVERTISING POSTERS AND NOTICES IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS,
AND THE DEPARTMENT NOW ANSWERS SOME 300-400 ENQUIRIES PER MONTH.
INFORMATION SERVICE TO LAYMEN.
     
THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICE IS EXPLAINED. THE REASONS FOR THE
EXISTENCE OF SUCH SERVICES ARE INDICATED AND THEIR HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT IS
SKETCHED. THE OBJECTIVES OF COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES ARE SHOWN AND THE
ACTIVITIES THEY UNDERTAKE ARE TREATED. IT IS SHOWN THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES FORM
A SUITABLE BASE FOR SUCH SERVICES. THE POSSIBILITIES FOR RENDERING COMMUNITY
INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE EXAMINED. STEPS NECESSARY FOR
INSTITUTING A SERVICE ARE TREATED AND THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF STAFF INVOLVEMENT IS
SHOWN.
NEWCOMER SERVICES OF THE ONTARIO GOVERNMENT.
     
THE NEWCOMER SERVICES BRANCH OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND RECREATION
PROVIDES AN INFORMATION SERVICE TO IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ENTERING ONTARIO.
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN 16 LANGUAGES AND INCLUDES SUCH TOPICS AS
APPLICATION FOR A SOCIAL INSURANCE NUMBER, EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITIES, GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMMES.
MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCES OF BUSINESS INFORMATION IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY' BASED
LARGELY ON OBSERVATIONS IN NOTTINGHAM BUSINESS LIBRARY.
     
(MSC DISSERTATION-LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.) DEFINES BUSINESS
INFORMATION. DISCUSSES THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF PUBLIC BUSINESS LIBRARIES'
RESOURCES (BASIC STOCK, ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL, AND PRESTEL); EXPLOITATION OF
RESOURCES (CLASSIFICATION, ARRANGEMENT, ACCESS, AND EXTERNAL SOURCES); USERS
(COMMUNITY PROFILE, NUMBER AND TYPE OF USER, USER NEEDS, AND PUBLICITY); STAFF
(QUALITY, KNOWLEDGE, PROFESSIONAL DUTIES, AND SERVICES TO FIRMS AND
INDUSTRIES); AND THE FUTURE (NEW TECHNOLOGY, CHARGING, AND THE CASE FOR A
NATIONAL BUSINESS LIBRARY).
INFORMATION SERVICES TO TRADE, INDUSTRY AND THE PROFESSIONS.
     
THE LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY, SUCH AS THE JOHANNESBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY, SOUTH
AFRICA, THAT IS SITUATED IN AN AREA WITH MANY SPECIAL LIBRARIES, CAN PROVIDE
AN INFORMATION SERVICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO ARE WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE
SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SUCH A LIBRARY CAN OFTEN PROVIDE REFERENCE MATERIAL WHICH
IS NOT SPECIALISED ENOUGH FOR THE SPECIAL LIBRARY WHILE NOT POPULAR ENOUGH FOR
THE SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY. AT LEAST SOME INFORMATION SOURCES ON A VERY WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS ARE REQUIRED. THE LIBRARY STAFF CANNOT BE EXPERTS ON ALL
THESE FIELDS. THEY CONSEQUENTLY REFER USERS TO INFORMATION SOURCES AND EXPECT
USERS TO DO THEIR OWN SEARCHING. USERS OFTEN FALL IN THE SMALL BUSINESS
CATEGORY AND ARE WITHOUT LIBRARIES OF THEIR OWN. THE INFORMATION THEY NEED MAY
SOMETIMES NOT BE AVAILABLE IN A FORM APPLICABLE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN
SITUATION. THE JOHANNESBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVES AS A DEPOSITORY FOR THE
JOURNALS RECEIVED BY MANY SCIENTIFIC A ND TECHNICAL SOCIETIES IN JOHANNESBURG,
AND IN SOME CASES THE LIBRARY MANAGES AND MAINTAINS THE LIBRARY OF A SOCIETY
WITHIN THE JPL BUILDING. RENDERING INFORMATION SERVICES IS ONE WAY TO SHOW
THAT THE LIBRARY IS USING PUBLIC MONEY TO GOOD ADVANTAGE.
INFORMATION AND EDUCATION' THE PART PLAYED BY INFORMATION IN DEVELOPING
TECHNICAL-SCIENTIFIC CREATIVITY IN PUPILS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A SEMINAR ON INFORMATION AND EDUCATION, SPONSORED BY THE
RUMANIAN CENTRAL PEDAGOGIC LIBRARY, 18-19 DEC 80. DISCUSSES THE CORRELATION
BETWEEN INFORMATION USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVE INTELLECTUAL SKILLS. AFTER
ASSIMILATION IN THE STUDENT'S MIND, INFORMATION IS ORGANISED INTO COMPLEX
ASSOCIATIVE SYSTEMS. INFORMATION RELATIONSHIPS ARE DEVELOPED, COMBINED AND
CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE CREATIVE TECHNICO-SCIENTIFIC ACT.
THE POSSIBILITIES OF MICROGRAPHICS IN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS.
     
KEEPING IN MIND THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM IN HUNGARY, PREDICTS A POSSIBLE BOOM IN THE APPLICATION OF
MICROGRAPHICS, DISCUSSES GENERAL ASPECTS FOR THE INSTALLATION AND INTRODUCTION
OF MICROFILM SYSTEMS AND DEALS WITH THEIR ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT.
INFORMATION SERVICES IN INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH INSTITUTES.
     
SUMMARY OF A 1977 BRAZILIAN THESIS IN INFORMATION SCIENCE. PRESENTS A MODEL
FOR INFORMATION CENTRES IN RESEARCH INSTITUTES, TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CLIENTS
AND PROMOTE THE SERVICES OF THE PARENT ORGANISATION. 8 COMMON TYPES OF
INFORMATION SERVICES ARE DEFINED, AND 14 DIFFERENT KINDS OF RESEARCH
INSTITUTES RELEVANT TO THIS MODEL LISTED. THE PROPOSED MODEL DEMONSTRATES HOW
TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USERS; THE
NATURE OF THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF RESEARCHERS, TECHNICIANS, AND MARKETERS;
AND THE INFORMATION SERVICES TO BE OFFERED, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO
ABSTRACTING AND QUESTION AND ANSWER SERVICES. BY EFFECTING CONTINUOUS
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE AND ITS CLIENTS SUCH INFORMATION SERVICES
ALLOW IDENTIFICATION OF THE NATURE OF POTENTIAL DEMANDS FOR INFORMATION,
TECHNICAL SERVICES, AND RESEARCH.
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE ORGANISATION OF INFORMATION SUPPLY FOR SPECIALISTS
IN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTES.
     
INFORMATION SUPPLY FOR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE SPECIALISTS IS
PECULIAR IN ITS CONNECTIONS WITH MULTI-ASPECTIVITY AND OPERATION OF JOBS,
INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTUALITY AND AUTHENTICITY OF INFORMATION, AND
FOR SPECIFIC ORIGIN STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENTS COLLECTION. DESCRIBES THE
SYSTEMATIC ORGANISATION OF THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT OF THE UKRAINIAN STATE
DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE 'METALLURGAVTOMATIKA' (AUTOMATION FOR
METALLURGY); SUCH A SYSTEM IS APPLICABLE IN RESEARCH INSTITUTES, DESIGN
OFFICES AND 'SOCIALIST PRODUCTION UNIONS' AS WELL AS IN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
INSTITUTES.
THEORETICAL MODEL OF AN INFORMATION CENTRE FOR INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES.
     
PRESENTS A THEORETICAL MODEL OF A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRE
FOR LARGE INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES IN HUNGARY. COMPARES THE MODEL WITH THE
DEVELOPMENT AND PRESENT STATUS OF HUNGARIAN SPECIAL LIBRARIES.
ORGANISATION OF SPECIALISED INFORMATION SERVICES AT INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES.
PART 1.
     
1ST OF A 5-PART SERIES WHICH DESCRIBES THE USE OF MATHEMATICAL METHODS APPLIED
IN ORDER TO OPTIMISE AN INFORMATION SYSTEM. DEALS WITH ADVANCED TECHNIQUES OF
SURVEYING INFORMATION NEEDS.
INFORMATION SUPPLY TO RESEARCH WORKS.
     
PROPOSES A SYSTEM WHEREBY GENERALISED INFORMATION ABOUT GAPS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
IN SCIENCE CAN BE OBTAINED, AND A 2ND SYSTEM OF SUPPLYING INFORMATION TO
PROBLEM-ORIENTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
PATENT COVERAGE BY ABSTRACTING SERVICES. 4. COVERAGE OF MICROBIOLOGICAL
PATENTS.
     
REPORTS A STUDY ON THE COVERAGE BY 7 MAJOR ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD
OF MICROBIOLOGY IN REGARD TO PATENTS. ONLY 3 OF THE SERVICES-2CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS, MICROBIOLOGY ABSTRACTS, SECTION +A, 1AND 2FOOD SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY ABSTRACTS1-COVER PATENTS AT ALL. THE 3 SERVICES WERE ASSESSED IN
TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE ABOUT PATENTS AND IN TERMS OF THEIR
PERFORMANCE IN RETRIEVING PATENTS TAKEN FROM A MASTER LIST OF PATENTS ON
GENETIC ENGINEERING AND VITAMIN D, OBTAINED BY SEARCHES ON 2WORLD PATENTS
INDEX. 1TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES WAS ALSO ASSESSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT NONE
OF THE STANDARD ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD COVER PATENTS SATISFACTORILY
AND THEY ARE SLOW IN PICKING UP PATENTS. THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT BY
SCANNING JUST JAPANESE, U.S.S.R. U.S., AND U.K. PATENTS, BOTH TIMELY AND
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE MICROBIOLOGICAL PATENT LITERATURE CAN BE
OBTAINED.
A UNIFIED PATIENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
THE HEALTH SERVICE INFORMATION STEERING GROUP (THE KORNER GROUP) WAS SET UP AT
THE BEGINNING OF 1980. IT WAS TO BE CONCERNED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF INFORMATION
FOR HEALTH SERVICE MANAGEMENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA. SO FAR, SUB-GROUPS HAVE BEEN SET UP TO REVIEW PARTICULAR
TYPES OF INFORMATION. SUMMARISES THE WORK OF GROUP A, WHICH HAS JUST BEEN
REPORTED AND DEALS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENTS AND THE FACILITIES THEY
USE.
THE CLINICAL LIBRARIAN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY.
     
A SUBJECTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICE OFFERED FOR 2 YEARS BY A CLINICAL
LIBRARIAN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, GUY'S HOSPITAL. THE LIBRARIANS WERE
BASED IN THE USER ENVIRONMENT AND AIMED INITIALLY TO IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION
NEEDS OF THE CLINICAL TEAM BY ATTENDING WARD ROUNDS AND MEETINGS, TO MEET
THESE NEEDS IMMEDIATELY BY PROVIDING SELECTED DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO PATIENT
CARE QUERIES, TO BUILD MULTIDISCIPLINARY DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS RELATING TO
SPECIFIC PATIENT CARE PROBLEMS, AND TO MAKE THESE AVAILABLE TO OTHER HOSPITALS
IN THE DISTRICT. THEY AIMED ALSO TO COMPILE VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS BASED ON THE
DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS AND TO EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF TEACHING LITERATURE
SEARCHING TECHNIQUES PARTICULARLY TO CLINICAL STUDENTS AND NEWLY QUALIFIED
DOCTORS. DISCUSSES WHY NOT ALL THESE AIMS COULD BE FULFILLED AND DESCRIBES
SOME OF THE FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED THE WAY THE SERVICE DEVELOPED IN THE
DEPARTMENT.
INFORMATION FOR AGRO-INDUSTRY.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1981 INTERAMERICAN CONFERENCE OF AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS. BRAZIL, LIKE OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, IS
LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SUPPLIES, DERIVED FROM NATURAL RESOURCES,
EXPLOITED BY AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. CONSIDERS THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SERVICES IN SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FIELD, DESCRIBING
THE KIND OF RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED AND THE SERVICES REQUIRED. PRESENTS
A MODEL FOR ORGANISING AN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICE WITHIN A
RESEARCH INSTITUTION, WITH DETAILS OF THE ACTIVITIES ESSENTIAL FOR INFORMATION
ACQUISITION, PROCESSING AND DISSEMINATION; USER SERVICES; AND SUPPORT SERVICES
FOR THE PARENT INSTITUTION; SHOWING HOW THE STRUCTURE CAN BE MODIFIED FOR
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USERS. IN CONCLUSION, EMPHASISES THAT AGRO-INDUSTRIAL
INFORMATION IS A NEW FIELD WITH ITS OWN SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS.
SUMMARIES OF THE PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE 6TH INTERAMERICAN CONFERENCE OF
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS-RIBDA. SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC, 14-18 JUNE, 1981.
     
THE GENERAL THEME OF THE CONFERENCE WAS AVAILABILITY, DEMAND AND USE OF
AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. AT THE 1ST
SESSION, ON THE AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SERVICES AVAILABLE, 5 PAPERS WERE
PRESENTED, AND AT THE 2ND, ON ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF SERVICES, 14 PAPERS.
THE SPEAKERS WERE DRAWN FROM THE INFORMATION SERVICES OF THE CHIEF
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.
ON SOME INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF MANAGERS.
     
CONSIDERS SOME PECULIARITIES OF MANAGEMENT WHICH NECESSITATE PROVISION OF
SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO MANAGERS. 4 REQUIREMENTS ARE' INTELLIGIBILITY,
CONCISENESS, RELIABILITY AND SYSTEMATISATION; THEIR DIFFERENCES FROM
ANALOGICAL REQUIREMENTS TO INFORMATION INTENDED FOR OTHER SPHERES OF ACTIVITY
ARE SHOWN, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE ON THE FULFILMENT OF SUCH
REQUIREMENTS.
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ETK IN INFORMING ITS PARTNER INSTITUTES ABOUT ITS
SERVICES.
     
SINCE 1979, THE HUNGARIAN BUILDING INFORMATION CENTRE (ETK) HAS BEEN PREPARING
ANALYTICAL DESCRIPTIONS ON ITS SERVICES AS PART OF THE FRAMEWORK OF
COOPERATION WITH ITS PARTNER INSTITUTES. THEY HAVE EITHER BEEN PUBLISHED IN
THE INFORMATION BULLETIN OF THE PARTNER INSTITUTES OR USED AS BASIC MATERIAL
FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING. REVIEWS PUBLICATIONS COMPLETED SO FAR.
NET-PLANNING IN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
     
THE ADVANTAGES OF NET-PLANNING IN THE EDITORIAL PROCESS ARE DESCRIBED. THE
METHOD CAN BE RENDERED MORE EFFECTIVE BY THE APPLICATION OF GRADUAL
NET-PLANNING AND 'SLIDE-ALONG' NET-PLANNING. IT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO THE
SOLUTION OF ANY INFORMATION-RELATED TASK IF IDENTICAL ACTIVITIES HAVE TO BE
CARRIED OUT IN IDENTICAL SEQUENCE.
CALL FOR A NEW INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION ORDER' PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
     
ARGUES THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER AND THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION
ORDER ARE CLOSELY INTERDEPENDENT IN THAT BOTH REFLECT THE PROBLEMS POSED BY
THE IMBALANCE AND INJUSTICE THAT CHARACTERISE RELATIONS BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE NEEDS AND PROBLEMS OF ESTABLISHING A NEW
INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION ORDER ARE DISCUSSED.
IMPROVING NASA'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS THROUGH INCREASING SCREENING AND
EVALUATION IN THE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION PROGRAM.
     
THE CURRENT STATUS OF NASA'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED IF THE
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD. THIS UNDERSTANDING WILL ONLY
BE GAINED IF A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FACTORS GENERALLY INFLUENCING
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IS DEVELOPED, AND PARTICULARLY THOSE FACTORS AFFECTING
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FROM GOVERNMENT R AND D AGENCIES TO INDUSTRY. SECONDARY
UTILISATION OF AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY IS MADE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT DEPENDS
ON A TRANSFER PROCESS WHICH CROSSES ESTABLISHED ORGANISATIONAL LINES OF
AUTHORITY AND WHICH IS OUTSIDE WELL UNDERSTOOD PATTERNS OF TECHNICAL
APPLICATIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
INFORMATION COMMUNICATION IN KENYA (SIC) AGRICULTURE' BASIC PROBLEMS AND

LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AND GRADUATE STUDENTS' MORE WORK FOR GEORGE.
     
RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF FACULTY MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT KANSAS
CITY'S SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION, INTO THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS LIBRARY
INSTRUCTION FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS, ARE PRESENTED. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARY
SKILLS ARE INCREASINGLY INADEQUATE THE LONGER THE STUDENTS REMAIN IN SCHOOL,
THAT STUDENTS MAY PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY
RESEARCH SKILLS THAN DO THEIR INSTRUCTORS AND FINALLY, THAT LIBRARIANS CAN
UTILISE STUDENTS' SELF-EVALUATIONS OF RESOURCE SKILLS TO CONVINCE FACULTY OF
THE NEED FOR MORE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL.
USER/INFORMATION SYSTEM INTERFACE STUDY.
     
REPORT ON A WORKING PARTY AT THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SEMINAR
IN JAN 81. FROM AN ANALYSIS OF A DOCUMENT ON USER TRAINING, THE GROUP
CONCLUDED THAT LIBRARIANS WERE DEFICIENT IN THEIR CONCEPTION OF THEIR ROLE,
AND MOVED TO CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS. THE DISCUSSIONS LEAD TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT THE CURRENT TRAINING PROGRAMMES REFLECTED THE GENERAL SOCIAL
TENDENCY TO UNDERVALUE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE
FINALLY PRESENTED ON IMPROVEMENTS IN PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND THE INITIATION
OF FURTHER RESEARCH ON USERS. A LIST OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE WORKING PARTY IS
ATTACHED.
EDUCATING THE LIBRARY USER: AN EXPERIMENT AT DEAL AND DOVER LIBRARIES.

INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT, IN THE USA, 90% OF ALL ADULTS ENGAGE IN SOME
KIND OF LEARNING ACTIVITY AND 73% OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SELF-GUIDED. ALTHOUGH
NOT AFFILIATED TO AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION THESE STUDENTS FORM PART
OF AN 'INVISIBLE UNIVERSITY'. THE NEED FOR SOME SORT OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION BY
THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS IS DISCUSSED.
REFORM AND RENEWAL IN HIGHER EDUCATION' IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
     
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY ORIENTATION FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, 3-4 MAY 79.
LIP SERVICE' THE UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE
UNIVERSITY.
     
IN THE 1ST PHASE OF A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY USER EDUCATION PROGRAMME AT OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY, ALL INCOMING STUDENTS ARE ORIENTED TO THE USE OF 1 OR 2
UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES, LISTEN TO A LECTURE ON THE USE OF BASIC LIBRARY
TOOLS, AND THEN ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLETE AN EXERCISE IN FINDING INFORMATION ON
THEIR OWN WITHIN THE LIBRARY. THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN
THAT A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMME, WHICH REACHES 8,600 STUDENTS IN A TYPICAL FALL
TERM, IS POSSIBLE USING EXISTING STAFF.
EVALUATING UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY.
     
AS A LARGE-SCALE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION PROGRAMME (LIP) WAS IMPLEMENTED AT OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY, IT WAS EVALUATED AT EACH STAGE BY MEANS OF QUESTIONNAIRES.
DATA DERIVED FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES HELPED CHANGE THE CONTENT OF THE LIP
LECTURES, THE TYPE OF MATERIALS DISTRIBUTED TO THE STUDENTS, AND THE FORMAT OF
THE EXERCISES. IT ALSO EVALUATED THE SUCCESS THE PROGRAMME HAD IN REACHING
INCOMING STUDENTS AND IN GIVING THEM EXPERIENCE IN USING LIBRARY TOOLS.
SEPARATE SURVEYS ALSO SHOWED THAT STUDENTS RETAINED THEIR SKILLS AFTER A
PERIOD OF TIME, IMPROVED THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE LIBRARY, AND INCREASED
THEIR USE OF LIBRARY RESOURCES.
DOING LIBRARY RESEARCH' AN INTRODUCTION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS.
     
DESCRIBES THE WAY IN WHICH A LIBRARY IS ORGANISED, HOW TO USE THE CATALOGUE
AND OBTAIN/EVALUATE POTENTIALLY USEFUL BOOKS AND OTHER MATERIALS. CONCLUDES
WITH AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF STANDARD REFERENCES/GUIDES FOR AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF
SUBJECTS.
EDUCATION OF INFORMATION USERS IN AGRICULTURE.
     
IT IS NOW COMMONPLACE THAT THE GROWTH OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS SUCH THAT NO
INDIVIDUAL CAN READ ALL RELEVANT MATERIAL. INSTRUCTING AND TRAINING
UNDERGRADUATES IN MAKING USE OF LIBRARIES AND CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL
AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION, FIRSTLY AT THE RELEVANT ESTABLISHMENT OF HIGHER
EDUCATION AND LATER ON IN THEIR WORKING PLACE, IS THEREFORE OF THE HIGHEST
SIGNIFICANCE. FOR GREATER EFFECT, TRAINING SHOULD BEGIN DURING COMPULSORY
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. SINCE 1977, THE SCHOOL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND VETERINARY
MEDICINE AT STARA ZAGORA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN THIS FIELD. IT IS
HOPED THAT NATIONAL SYLLABUSES WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
CRITERION REFERENCED INVENTORY. GRADE 10 SKILL CLUSTERS, OBJECTIVES AND
ILLUSTRATIONS.

(1) UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT MATERIALS, (2) USING THE CARD CATALOGUE, (3) GENERAL
REFERENCE SKILLS, (4) USING DICTIONARIES, (5) USING ATLASES, (6) USING
NEWSPAPERS, (7) USING PERIODICAL INDEXES, (8) USING ADDITIONAL REFERENCE
MATERIALS, AND (9) THE PRODUCTION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVES FOR EACH
OF THE CLUSTERS ARE IDENTIFIED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE SCHOOL-LIBRARY PROGRAMME' AN ON-GOING PROJECT IN THE CITY OF SAO PAULO,
BRAZIL.
     
A DESCRIPTION ORIGINALLY PREPARED FOR A COURSE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH IS
INTENDED TO STIMULATE INTEREST IN READING AND TRAIN LIBRARY USERS. THE 1ST
PART CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF DIRECTED READINGS UNDER SUPERVISION; DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF THE CRITERIA FOR SELECTING TEXTS, THE INTEGRATION OF THE PROGRAMME
INTO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES, AND METHODS USED TO GUIDE READERS AND EVALUATE
PROGRESS. THE 2ND PART IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE PUPILS TO MAKE FULL USE OF
LIBRARIES; DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE RESOURCES REQUIRED, STRATEGIES EMPLOYED,
AND CONTROL AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES. THE BASIC REFERENCE WORKS ESSENTIAL IN
THE INITIAL STAGES ARE LISTED. THE WHOLE PROJECT IS A MODEL OF FUNCTIONAL
COOPERATION FOR TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS. AN EXAMPLE OF THE READER EVALUATION
TEST, THE RESULTS OF A STUDY OF READER PROGRESS, AND THE TEXT OF THE OFFICIAL
DECREE INSTITUTING THE PROGRAMME ARE APPENDED.
QUESTIONS OF LIBRARY DIDACTICS.
     
THE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL LIBRARY AT KASSEL-WALDAU, WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLIC
LIBRARY, IS A PILOT PROJECT IN THE KASSEL AREA. INSTRUCTION IN LIBRARY USE IS
PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM. INTRODUCTORY TALKS ARE GIVEN IN THE CLASSROOMS
BY TEACHERS, AFTER WHICH THE LIBRARIAN PROVIDES ABOUT 10 HOURS OF BASIC
INSTRUCTION IN THE LIBRARY ON MEDIA, USE OF CATALOGUES AND LIBRARY PROCEDURES.
THEN CHILDREN WORK IN THE LIBRARY, FINDING MATERIAL ON SUBJECTS OF INTEREST
AND PREPARING LITTLE TALKS ON THEM. LIBRARIAN AND TEACHERS ADVISE ON CHOICE OF
MATERIAL AND THE BEST WAYS OF EXTRACTING INFORMATION. CLOSE COOPERATION
BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND TEACHERS IS ESSENTIAL. TEACHERS RECEIVE INSTRUCTION ON
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AT REGIONAL ADVANCED TRAINING CONFERENCES.
TRAINING OF MIDDLE-GRADE HEALTH WORKERS IN THE UTILISATION OF MEDICAL
INFORMATION.
     
INFORMATION TRAINING FOR MIDDLE-GRADE HEALTH WORKERS IS COMING MORE AND MORE
INTO THE LIMELIGHT. 28 HEAD NURSES WORKING IN HUNGARIAN HOSPITALS AND
OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENTS WERE INTERVIEWED AS WAS THE HEAD OF NURSES' EXTENSION
TRAINING IN THE COUNTY HEALTH ORGANISATION CENTRE. ALL AGREED THAT NURSES
NEEDED TO STUDY MEDICAL LITERATURE. SUGGESTS 3 HOURS OF INFORMATION TRAINING
FOR THE MIDDLE-GRADE WORKERS WITH A FURTHER HOUR FOR PRACTICE.
LIBRARY-USE INSTRUCTIONS' ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG TERM EFFECTS.
     
THE RECOGNITION BY LIBRARIANS OF THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING
LIBRARY-USE INSTRUCTION IS STEADILY INCREASING, AS EVIDENCED BY REPORTS IN THE
LITERATURE. HOWEVER, MUCH WORK HAS YET TO BE DONE WHICH USES SOPHISTICATED
EVALUATION TECHNIQUES. REPORTS THE FOLLOW-UP OF AN EARLIER STUDY BY EXAMINING
THE LONG-TERM RETENTION OF LIBRARY-USE SKILLS. THROUGH USE OF PRETESTING AND
POSTTESTING, CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, AGGREGATE AND INDIVIDUAL
COMPARISONS, MULTIPLE REGRESSION, AND OTHER TECHNIQUES, CONCLUDES THAT
LONG-TERM POSSESSION OF LIBRARY-USE SKILLS IS MORE HIGHLY RELATED TO
LIBRARY-USE INSTRUCTION THAN TO EITHER INHERENT INTELLECTUAL ABILITY OR
ACADEMIC DILIGENCE. IN ADDITION, DISCUSSES THE APPROPRIATENESS OF QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE METHODS OF EVALUATION AND CAUTION AGAINST TAKING FOR GRANTED
THE EFFECTIVE USE OF EVALUATION.
UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND THE WORK OF THE IFLA INTERNATIONAL OFFICE
FOR UBC.

PROGRAMME TO RECORD THE WORLD'S PUBLISHING OUTPUT, WITH STANDARDISATION OF THE
COVERAGE AND CONTENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS. DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS (ISBDS) AND THEIR
REVISIONS, AND IFLA'S INTERNATIONAL OFFICE FOR UBC. ALSO LOOKS AT OTHER
FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE' THE PUBLISHING OF MANUALS ON SUBJECT AND NAME
HEADINGS; 2UNIMARC1' 2UNIVERSAL MARC FORMAT1; AND THE PROMOTION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHY.
MAP COLLECTIONS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. REPORT ON RECENT
ACTIVITIES.
     
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF MAPS IN WEST GERMANY ARE
REVIEWED.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS.
     
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL TITLES IN MICROFORM COLLECTIONS IS A
PROBLEM. NEITHER THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NOR MOST MICROPUBLISHERS FULLY
ANALYSE THESE COLLECTIONS. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO EITHER.
BUT WITHOUT AUTHOR AND TITLE ACCESS, THESE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL.
FULL ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR BUT NO EFFORT
YET HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES ABANDON FULL CATALOGUING IN
FAVOUR OF INDEXING, USING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MICROPUBLISHERS. WHILE A
NATIONAL INDEX TO THE CONTENTS OF MICROFORM COLLECTIONS WOULD BE BEST, AN
ALTERNATIVE FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES WOULD BE TO CREATE THEIR OWN COM INDEX.
A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL STUDY ON MEDICAL CONGRESSES.
     
CONSIDERS THE PROBLEMS OF MEDICAL CONGRESS LITERATURE, AND PROVIDES SPECIFIC
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FOR RESEARCHERS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF DIRECTORIES,
BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND CATALOGUES, BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALIST, NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL IN SCOPE, WHICH CAN BE USED AS RESOURCES FOR INFORMATION ABOUT:
THE EXISTENCE OF CONGRESSES; THE EXISTENCE OF CONGRESS PUBLICATIONS; AND
ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS. THE SURVEY INCLUDES BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA BASES
ALLOWING ON-LINE SEARCHES. ADDRESSES OF PUBLISHERS CITED ARE APPENDED,
TOGETHER WITH TABLES SUMMARISING ESSENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PUBLICATIONS
DISCUSSED.
SPECIAL DOCUMENTATION SERVICES: 2 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES.
     
IN MAY 78 THE PROVINCIAL CENTRAL LIBRARY OF LIMBURG IN THE NETHERLANDS CREATED
A CURRENT AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS INFORMATION SERVICE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
REGION. AT THE CENTRAL LIBRARY A TEAM OF 2 STAFF SCAN 5 NATIONAL AND ALL LOCAL
NEWSPAPERS TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF JOURNALS OF LOCAL INTEREST FOR ARTICLES
AND INFORMATION RELATING TO LIMBURG. THE INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM THESE
SOURCES IS CLASSIFIED INTO 75 SUBJECT FIELDS COVERING THE SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND
POLITICAL LIFE OF THE PROVINCE, AND AT PRESENT 57 LIBRARIES SUBSCRIBE TO THIS
SERVICE. IN THE NAARDEN-BUSSUM CENTRAL PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS A
SIMILAR SERVICE WAS FORMED IN OCT 79 RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING
OPPORTUNITIES. DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS THE SERVICE IS ORGANISED BY AN UNPAID,
VOLUNTARY ASSISTANT.
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR DATA BASES IN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY COMPARING AGRICOLA, AGRIS AND CAB, INTENDED PRIMARILY TO
ESTABLISH SELECTION CRITERIA FOR USE AND ACQUISITION. REFERENCES WERE
RETRIEVED RELATING TO 11 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, BY EACH OF THE 3 DATA BASES
SINGLY, AND IN COMBINATIONS OF 2, AND COMPARED FOR DUPLICATION AND DIVERSITY.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF INITIAL HYPOTHESES, AND MATERIALS AND METHODS USED.
RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN FULL, AND AN INDEX OF DUPLICATION CALCULATED, SHOWING
WHICH COMBINATION OF 2 OUT OF 3 DATA BASES IS THE MOST EFFICIENT. THE DATA
OBTAINED WERE ALSO USED TO INVESTIGATE PUBLICATION LANGUAGES AND COUNTIES OF
ORIGIN OF ARTICLES. REFINEMENTS OF THE METHODOLOGY USED ARE SUGGESTED.
SDI IN AN ACADEMIC COMMUNITY.
     
A 6-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL SDI SERVICE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NATAL
LIBRARY, PIETERMARITZBURG SOUTH AFRICA, AS PART OF A PLAN TO MAKE SUBJECT
LIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIME
FOR ACADEMICS WAS AT A PREMIUM. A METHODOLOGY WAS DEVISED AND 21 LECTURERS
FROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27 PROFILES. REFERENCES WERE
SUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THE
LIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6 MONTHS, FEEDBACK
REVEALED THAT 93% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLY
RELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERE
THE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF A
CONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINOR
IMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOB
SATISFACTION AND ALLOWED THEM TO LOOK MORE CRITICALLY AT LIBRARY STOCK. IN
TERMS OF  TIME AND FINANCIAL COST THE SDI SERVICE WAS EASILY ABSORBED INTO THE
EXISTING WORK STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARY. IT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY
RELEVANT TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, AND IT RELIED UPON A WELL-DEVELOPED
SUBJECT LIBRARIAN STRUCTURE. ITS SUCCESS, HOWEVER, DEPENDED ON AN ACTIVE
CAMPAIGN BY LIBRARIANS DIRECTED AT POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES AND
RELATED ACTIVITIES IN 1980.
     
A SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY OF REPORTS COVERING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND ABSTRACTING
SERVICES IN THE USA AND DESIGNED TO SERVE AS A GUIDE TO A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
PUBLICATIONS, PUBLISHERS, ASSOCIATIONS AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO GIVE AN
IMPRESSION OF THE VARIETY OF CURRENT ACTIVITIES AND TO SUGGEST TO THE USER THE
MANY SOURCES IN HIS AREA OF INTEREST.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS FROM 1907 UP TO 1980.
     
EVALUATES A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF CITATIONS FROM CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS FOR 1907
TO 1980. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN STATISTICS FOR JOURNAL ARTICLES, PATENTS, AND
BOOKS. THE INCREASE IN SIZE OF THE PRINTED ISSUES OF +C+A FROM 1950 TO 1980 IS
DESCRIBED IN DETAIL, ALSO WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUIRED SHELF SPACE IN THE
LIBRARY. DEVELOPMENT OF PRICES, 1971-81 SHOWED AN INSIGNIFICANT RISE IN COSTS
PER REPORT OR CITATION. A COMPARISON OF PRICES FOR THE PRINTED ISSUE AND FOR
LITERATURE RETRIEVAL VIA DATA PROCESSING OF +C+A OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF
COMPARISON ON THE BASIS OF THE DIFFERENT FREQUENCY OF USE.
INDEXES TO HEBREW PERIODICALS-A BIBLIOGRAPHY (IN HEBREW).
     
THERE IS A GROWING DEMAND ON THE PART OF HIGH-SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,
AS WELL AS THE GENERAL READING PUBLIC, FOR INFORMATION INCLUDED IN HEBREW
PERIODICALS. IT IS SURPRISING, THEREFORE, HOW FEW EDITORS HAVE SUPPLIED THEIR
READERS WITH CUMULATIVE INDEXES. NOTES 8 ITEMS-CURRENT AND RETROSPECTIVE-WHICH
INDEX MORE THAN 1 HEBREW PERIODICAL. IN THE 2ND SECTION, LISTS 115 PUBLISHED
CUMULATIVE INDEXES TO HEBREW PERIODICALS AND 6 MORE WHICH EXIST ONLY AS CARD
FILES IN THE JUDAICA READING ROOM OF THE JEWISH NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, JERUSALEM.
ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TRANSLATION IN INFORMATION TRANSFER ACROSS
THE LANGUAGE BARRIER' MANAGING TO MEET TRANSLATION NEEDS AT THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION (IN ENGLISH AND RUMANIAN).
     
IN RUMANIA, THE ACTIVITY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TRANSLATION IS SHOWN TO
BE CARRIED ON AT 3 LEVELS' AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION (INID), IN THE SPECIALISED DOCUMENTARY
INFORMATION OFFICES AND IN SOME NATIONAL ECONOMIC UNITS. EMPHASISES THE
ACTIVITY OF INID, BASED ON STATISTICS.
REFERENCE SERVICES IN THE 1980'S.
     
THE THEME OF THIS ISSUE IS THAT OF FUTURE PROBLEMS FACING REFERENCE LIBRARIANS
AND THE ROLE OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN IN THE COMING DECADE. THE ISSUE IS
ALSO AVAILABLE IN HARDBACK BOOK FORM, (ISBN 0-86656-110-2), PRICE $22.00.
REFERENCE SERVICE, REFERENCE LIBRARIAN AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION.
     
REFERENCE SERVICE IS DEFINED AS A DIRECT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
STAFF. REFERENCE LIBRARIANS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION.
THE MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE ENORMOUS OUTPUT OF LITERATURE. THE
REFERENCE LIBRARIAN NEEDS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE SOURCES TO PROVIDE
THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT READER AT THE RIGHT TIME.
THE 200 QUESTIONS.
     
DESCRIBES HOW PROFIT-MAKING INFORMATION BROKER INFORMATION ON DEMAND,
BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, WAS CONTRACTED TO ANSWER 200 REFERENCE QUESTIONS FOR THE
NORTH SUBURBAN LIBRARY SYSTEM, WHEELING, ILLINOIS TO HELP CLEAR ITS BACKLOG OF
QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. DISCUSSES' SORTING THE QUESTIONS; HOW MUCH EFFORT
TO PUT INTO EACH QUESTION; ON-LINE SEARCHING; ERRORS; COSTS; AND RESULTS.
ACTIVE LISTENING AT THE REFERENCE DESK.
     
DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF ACTIVE LISTENING AS A COMMUNICATION SKILL AND SHOWS
HOW IT CAN BE APPROPRIATE TO THE REFERENCE INTERVIEW. THROUGH THE USE OF
ACTIVE LISTENING, MORE PRECISE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PATRON AND REFERENCE
LIBRARIAN CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND BETTER REFERENCE SERVICE GIVEN.
JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION OF REFERENCE STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT DESPITE AUTOMATION, LIBRARY WORK WILL REMAIN LABOUR INTENSIVE; IT
IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THE SITUATION,
PARTICULARLY IN REFERENCE WORK, WHERE IN GENERAL THE QUALITY IS LOW. TO
INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION, A SURVEY WAS
CARRIED OUT AMONG ONTARIO REFERENCE LIBRARY STAFF, USING TECHNIQUES OF
ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT ADAPTED FROM THE FIELD OF BUSINESS STUDIES. DETAILS
ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, QUESTIONNAIRE CONSTRUCTION, AND RATING
TECHNIQUES. RESULTS SHOWED GENERALLY MODERATE SATISFACTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS, BUT LOW MOTIVATION. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS, THAT PROFESSIONALS
WOULD EXPRESS GREATER MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION THAN NON-PROFESSIONALS, WAS
NOT CONFIRMED.
MISCELLANY. JOSE MARTI NATIONAL LIBRARY.
     
A REPORT OF ACTIVITIES IN 1980. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF 2 EXHIBITIONS OF
DOCUMENTARY TREASURES, FROM 1950-52, AND FROM 1953-80; OUTSTANDING ITEMS ARE
DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. PAPERS PRESENTED IN THE REGULAR SYMPOSIUM SERIES,
COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF BOOK PRODUCTION AND PUBLICATION, INTENDED FOR
LIBRARIANS, ARE LISTED, AND CONCERTS, RECITALS, AND OTHER MEETINGS BRIEFLY
DESCRIBED. THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE CELEBRATIONS
MARKING JOSE MARTI DAY, AN OCCASION OF PATRIOTIC COMMEMORATION; DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF THE LIBRARY'S LARGE-SCALE MULTI-MEDIA EXHIBITION OF MATERIAL ABOUT
REVOLUTIONS PAST AND PRESENT, AND OF THE OFFICIAL NATIONAL REUNION HELD.
IN THE POET'S LAND.
     
THE MUZEI-ZAPOVEDNIK A.S. PUSHKINA (A.S. PUSHKIN MUSEUM-PRESERVE) IS A
LITERARY MECCA IN JUNE ON PUSHKIN'S NAME-DAY. POEMS ARE READ AND SONGS
PERFORMED IN HIS HONOUR. LIBRARIANS SHOULD HELP READERS TO APPRECIATE
PUSHKIN'S POETRY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY COULD COMPILE A WORK ON PUSHKIN BASED
ON THE MUSEUM'S VISITORS' BOOKS, DATING FROM 1899. READERS COULD BE ENCOURAGED
TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY DISCOVERED PUSHKIN. PUSHKIN LITERARY EVENINGS SHOULD
TREAT ONLY ONE OF HIS WORKS AND ADAPT TO THE AUDIENCE'S AGE GROUP. FOR THESE,
LIBRARIANS COULD STUDY VARIANTS OF HIS POEMS, THE SOCIAL LIFE AND POPULAR
CULTURE OF HIS TIME. THE PUSHKINOGORETS REGIONAL LIBRARY SHOULD BECOME A
REPOSITORY OF PUSHKIN AREA LEGENDS. THE MUSEUM STRIVES TO ENCOURAGE A LIVELY
PERCEPTION OF HISTORY.
POETRY, COFFEE AND CAKES: POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD.
     
DESCRIBES THE EFFORTS OF HALMSTAD PUBLIC LIBRARY TO PROMOTE POETRY. SWEDISH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE POETRY, AND POETRY EVENINGS ARE AN
EXCEPTION. POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD BEGAN IN AUTUMN 80 WITH EVENING GATHERINGS
HELD IN HALMSTAD'S BRANCH LIBRARY IN OSTERGARD SCHOOL. THE AIM WAS NOT TO
REPLACE HALMSTAD CENTRAL LIBRARY'S AUTHOR EVENINGS, BUT TO COMPLEMENT THEM
WITH ACTIVITIES IN A BRANCH LIBRARY. NEW FORMS WERE SOUGHT WHICH INVOLVED THE
PARTICIPANTS IN ACTIVE LISTENING AND CONVERSATION. A CAFE ATMOSPHERE WITH
COFFEE AND CAKES WAS CREATED. MANY OF THE POETS LIVED LOCALLY. THE LIBRARY
PRINTS POSTERS AND ADVERTISES IN THE LOCAL PRESS AND RADIO PRIOR TO EACH
EVENING AND PREPARES FREE FOLDERS WITH POEMS AND INTRODUCTIONS TO THE POETS.
EMPHASISES THAT THERE MUST BE CONTINUITY THROUGH REGULAR ACTIVITIES AND THAT
MORE PERSONAL CONTACT TO PROMOTE THE EVENINGS AND MORE PARTICIPATION BY
AMATEUR POETS ARE NEEDED IF THE CAFE IS TO CONT INUE.
INTERVIEW: MARISA KARAM SALTORI.

COMPILATION OF INFORMATION ON COMMERCIAL PROCESSING SERVICES; AND (4) AN
ANALYSIS OF OCLC BILLING DATA TO COMPARE THE ACTIVITY OF REPORTED PROCESSING
CENTRES WITH THAT OF OCLC PARTICIPANTS IN GENERAL.
THE LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WENT UP IN SMOKE.
     
SINCE 1977, THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS STRESSED THAT AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
SHOULD BEGIN WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. BIBLIOTEKSDATA HAS REPLIED THAT THEIR
DEVELOPMENT PLANS AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITY, BUT ADDS THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES MUST
BE FREE TO DECIDE WHICH AUTOMATION SYSTEM TO USE. FEARS THAT BIBLIOTEKSDATA,
IN EFFECT, IS GIVING PRIORITY TO AUTOMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, SUCH AS
ISSUES AND ACQUISITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE UNION HAS ARGUED THE NEED FOR TERMINAL
ACCESS FOR LIBRARIES TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. PROVISION OF SUCH ACCESS
HAS BEEN HELD UP BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION OF THE BEST SUBJECT SEARCH
SYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN SOLVED. MEANTIME, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS SHOULD BE MADE TO
PROVIDE TERMINAL ACCESS WITH FREE TEXT SEARCHING, SIMILAR SEARCHING ON
MICROFORM, AND EXPANSION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES WITH SUBJECT WORDS. ARGUES
THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA'
SERVICES.
BIBLIOTHEKSDATA HAS A PLAN.
     
A STATEMENTS BY BIBLIOTEKSDATA ON ITS PAST ACHIEVEMENT AND FUTURE PLANS. SINCE
1974, THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP A DATA BASE OF NOW 280,000
TITLES, INVALUABLE FOR LIBRARIES IN THEIR STOCK REGISTRATION. THE EXPERIENCE
FROM THE AUTOMATION OF OLSTYKKE LIBRARY WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE FUTURE SYSTEM.
SPECIFICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION OF MATERIALS, ISSUE CONTROL AND CATALOGUES
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. A PROJECT CONSISTING OF MODULES WHICH LIBRARIES CAN
ACCEPT GRADUALLY HAS NOW BEEN DEVELOPED. THE PROJECT IS DEPENDENT ON' COMPUTER
REGISTRATION OF LIBRARIES' STOCK, DECENTRALISED INPUT OF DATA IN OWN
TERMINALS, STANDARDISATION, GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF MODULES AS THEY BECOME
READY, AND LOCALLY DETERMINED SELECTION OF MODULES. THE CATALOGUING MODULE
WILL BE READY AT THE END OF 1982, THE ISSUE AND ACQUISITIONS MODULES DURING
1983. THE BETA MODULE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REGISTER A LIBRARY'S HOLDINGS OF
TITLES ALREADY IN THE LIBRARY CENTRE BASE. SUPPLIERS OF HARDWARE ARE TO  BE
CHOSEN DURING SPRING 82; RUNNING COSTS CAN, THEREFORE, NOT BE CALCULATED YET.
AUTOMATION IN AUSTRIAN LIBRARIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. DESCRIBES AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEM ADOPTED BY THE GRAZ
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, SELECTED TO CARRY OUT AN AUTOMATION PROJECT BEFORE THE
INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION IN OTHER AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIES
ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH. THE SYSTEM
COMPRISES A COMPUTERISED ISSUE SYSTEM BASED ON THE LIGHT PEN AND ON-LINE
CATALOGUING AND SEARCHING. WHEN THE SYSTEM BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL
THROUGHOUT ALL LIBRARIES CONCERNED, THE NETWORK WILL BE DIVIDED BY REGIONS
INTO SMALLER UNITS AND EACH LIBRARY WILL HAVE ITS MINICOMPUTER. USER SERVICES
WILL BE IMPROVED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL THROUGH THE LARGE
INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES.
COLLECTION PROCESSING AS A TEAM EFFORT.
     
DESCRIBES THE EXPERIMENT, CARRIED OUT AT THE ARCHIVES OF APPALACHIA, TO
COMPARE THE TEAM APPROACH TO COLLECTION PROCESSING WITH THE MORE TRADITIONAL
ONE. STUDENT-WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED ON REPETITIVE PROCESSING TASKS, INCLUDING
CLEANING/FLATTENING AND TREATMENT FOR MOULDS AND INSECT INFESTATION AND
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL COLLECTIONS WERE PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLY
WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE IN THE QUALITY OF EITHER ARRANGEMENT OR DESCRIPTION AND
TOTAL MONTHLY OUTPUT FROM THE TEAM WAS 3 TIMES THAT FROM A SINGLE ARCHIVIST
WORKING ALONE.
PROPOSAL FOR A COMMON EXCHANGE/COMMUNICATION FORMAT' OPINION PAPER ON
STANDARDIZATION OF MACHINE READABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS.
     
THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR STANDARDIZATION DEVELOPED ITS STANDARD ISO'
2709-1973 WHICH FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL MACHINE
READABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD FORMATS. OUTLINES A FORMAT GIVING MUCH
IMPORTANCE TO THE DATA ELEMENTS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS, WITH UNIQUE
IDENTIFICATION FOR EACH OF THE CONSTITUENTS FOLLOWING A TAGGING SCHEME. A
MODEL FORMAT FOR THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF SIMPLE MONOGRAPHS IS
PRESENTED AS ILLUSTRATION WHICH REFLECTS A SINGLY LINKED LIST STRUCTURE, EACH
PRECEDING TAG OF A DATA ELEMENT HAVING A FIELD GIVING THE LENGTH OF THE
ASSOCIATED DATA ELEMENT, WHICH SERVES AS A POINTER TO THE BEGINNING OF THE
SUCCEEDING TAG AND ITS ASSOCIATED DATA ELEMENT.
UNIMARC.
     
SEVERAL AGENCIES THAT WERE FORMERLY SATISFIED BY SINGLE CONVERSIONS FROM
ANOTHER FORMAT ARE BEGINNING TO REQUIRE DATA FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES. EITHER
MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS MUST BE WRITTEN OR A SWITCH TO UNIMARC COULD TAKE PLACE.
THE COST SAVINGS WITH UNIMARC ARE OBVIOUS. MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS PROGRAMMES
REPRESENT A HIGH INITIAL INVESTMENT AND A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM IN KEEPING UP
WITH ALL OF THE CHANGES TO NECESSARILY DYNAMIC NATIONAL FORMATS. THE
INTRODUCTION OF AACR2 AND RESULTANT NATIONAL FORMAT CHANGES ARE AT THIS TIME
CAUSING SEVERAL AGENCIES TO REWRITE CONVERSION PROGRAMMES. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO
A TRULY INTERNATIONAL UNIMARC EXCHANGE IS THAT THE CHANGE TAKES A JOINT
COMMITMENT SINCE AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO RECEIVE UNIMARC RECORDS IS USELESS IF
THE SENDING AGENCY CANNOT SEND THEM. IFLA AND ITS MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERTAKE A
MAJOR EFFORT TO BRING A UNIMARC PROGRAMME INTO SERVICE.
THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM' AN INTRODUCTION.
     
DESCRIBES THE PHILSOM AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT THE
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LIBRARY AT ST. LOUIS, WHICH PROVIDES
AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR THE FULL RANGE OF SERIALS CONTROL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE
LIBRARIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PHILSOM NETWORK. THE PHILSOM SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TO
PREDICT THE ISSUES WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE VARIOUS PARTICIPATING
LIBRARIES AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH RECORDS DESCRIBING EACH OF THESE ISSUES.
THE RECORDS FOR CHECKED-IN ISSUES AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE HOLDINGS DATA, AND
INTERACT WITH PREVIOUSLY CODED DATA TO PRODUCE CLAIMS AND BINDING
NOTIFICATIONS. THE SYSTEM ALSO PRODUCES ADDITIONAL OUTPUTS TO AID IN SERIALS
CONTROL.
FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. FOREIGN LITERATURE ACQUISITIONS IN THE ROYAL
LIBRARY REFLECT THE LIBRARY'S 2 MAIN FUNCTIONS, THAT OF THE SWEDISH NATIONAL
LIBRARY AND STOCKHOLM'S CENTRAL LIBRARY IN THE FIELDS OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL
SCIENCES. MATERIAL ACQUIRED IN KEEPING WITH THE 1ST FUNCTION (SUECANA
EXTRANEA) IS DIVIDED INTO 4 SECTIONS-FOREIGN TRANSLATIONS OF SWEDISH WRITERS'
WORKS, WORKS IN SWEDISH PUBLISHED ABROAD, WORKS ON SWEDEN AND WORKS OF SWEDISH
NATIONALS PUBLISHED ABROAD. EXCHANGES OF PUBLICATIONS WITH LIBRARIES IN OTHER
COUNTRIES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ACQUISITIONS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO
THE LIBRARY'S 2ND FUNCTION.
HOW TO ACHIEVE A RATIONAL STATEMENT, OR THAT IS ON THE NEED TO CHANGE THE
ACQUISITION AND CONTROL OF BOOK COLLECTIONS.
     
CONSIDERS IN DETAIL THE PRESENT SITUATION IN POLAND BY WHICH NEW PUBLICATIONS
ARE ORDERED AND DISTRIBUTED FROM A CENTRALISED STOCK CONTROL. THE SYSTEM WHICH
HAS MANY FAULTS IS CRITICISED AND SOME SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR ITS
ALTERATION.
CENTRALISED DISTRICT SYSTEM OF ACQUISITION.
     
IN SLOVAK PUBLIC LIBRARIES 3 MODES OF ACQUISITIONS ARE PRACTISED AT PRESENT'
THE INDIVIDUAL ONE, IN WHICH EVERY LIBRARY TRIES TO SATISFY ITS USERS' NEEDS
FROM ITS OWN STOCK; COMBINED MODE IN WHICH THE DISTRICT LIBRARY PROVIDES SOME
LIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT WITH LITERATURE; TOTAL CENTRALISATION OF
ACQUISITION, PRACTISED BY 17 DISTRICT LIBRARIES. THE LATTER IS THE MOST
RATIONAL MEANS OF ACQUISITION ON CONDITION THAT THE LITERATURE IS PROCESSED IN
1 CENTRE AND THAT A COLLECTIVE CATALOGUE IS KEPT. EACH CENTRAL LIBRARY MUST
FORMULATE ITS ACQUISITION POLICY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE REQUIREMENTS OF
READERS/USERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.
THE GUIDELINE ON STOCK EXPANSION IN GENERAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE 1976-80 GUIDELINES ON LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY, LONG-TERM STOCK
PLANNING WAS ADVOCATED ON A BASIS OF DIFFERENTIAL VALUES FOR STOCK ITEMS PER
INHABITANT, SO THAT STOCKS CAN BE ACQUIRED WHICH ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DEMANDS.
FUNCTIONAL EQUIPPING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE
REGIONAL PURCHASING SCHEME DEVELOPMENT. THE STOCK GUIDELINE FOR 1981-85
EMPHASISES STOCK EXPANSION AND THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT COPIES; OTHER
GUIDELINES COVER THE EXPANSION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICES, NEW RULES ON
THE PURCHASE OF PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS AND EXTRA PROVISION OF BOOKS IN
HOLIDAY RESORTS. THE LATEST GUIDELINES SHOULD REMOVE UNJUSTIFIABLE DIFFERENCES
IN STOCK STANDARDS.
SELECTED ASPECTS FROM THE CHANGE OF GUIDELINES ON STOCK EXPANSION IN LIBRARIES
IN THE LEIPZIG AREA.
     
IN 1975 THE NUMBER OF STOCK ITEMS PER INHABITANT IN LEIPZIG LIBRARIES WAS
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, SO PLANS FOR 1976-80 EMPHASISED STOCK
EXPANSION. VARIABLE PROVISION STANDARDS WERE CALCULATED FOR CENTRAL AND BRANCH
LIBRARIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR THIS PERIOD SHOWS A LARGE STOCK
BUDGET, SO THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF STOCK PROVISION WERE
REACHED OR EVEN EXCEEDED. ONLY SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS FELL
BELOW THE REQUISITE STANDARDS. OTHER AIMS FOR 1976-80 WERE THE EXPANSION AND
QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THE RAISING OF
PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES. PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED WITH
STOCKS FOR RURAL LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PART-TIME BRANCH LIBRARIES;
GUIDELINES FOR 1981-85 AIM TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT OF THE SERVICE.
RUSHMORE AT BERKELEY' THE DYNAMICS OF DEVELOPING A WRITTEN COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT.
     
FOR THE 1ST TIME IN ITS 100 YEAR HISTORY, THE GENERAL LIBRARY OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY HAS PRODUCED A WRITTEN, COORDINATED
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT. PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF THE DYNAMICS
OF THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DESIGN AND THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF
65 BOOK SELECTORS IN RECORDING POLICY DECISIONS AGREED UPON FOR THE COLLECTING
LEVELS IN ALL AREAS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THE COMPLEX
RESEARCH AND INSTRUCTIONAL NEEDS OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TITLE SERVICE FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
SINCE 1979 A PROJECT GROUP OF THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN LIBRARY
INSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN PREPARATORY WORK
TOWARDS A BOOK REVIEWING SERVICE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THE
SERVICE AIMS TO COVER ALL BOOKS OTHER THAN TEXTBOOKS WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR
USE BY TEACHERS AND PUPILS IN EDUCATIONAL OR LEISURE PURSUITS. THE MATERIAL
COVERED WILL CATER FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AT GENERAL OR VOCATIONAL
SCHOOLS. A PRELIMINARY SURVEY WAS MADE OF SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTES IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. 1 PILOT EDITION CONTAINING 200
REVIEWS WILL APPEAR IN FEB/MAR 82, A 2ND EDITION IS PLANNED FOR THE AUTUMN. IF
THE PROJECT IS REALISED, IT WILL ULTIMATELY COVER 2,000 TITLES A YEAR.
THE LEGAL DEPOSIT LEGISLATION AS THE BASIS OF THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF
PRINTED MATERIALS IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. AFTER A SHORT INTRODUCTION INTO THE HISTORY OF
LEGAL DEPOSIT LEGISLATION IN SCANDINAVIA, CONCENTRATES ON ITS DEVELOPMENT IN
SWEDEN. NEW LEGAL DEPOSIT LAW CAME INTO FORCE IN 1979, THE PREVIOUS
LEGISLATION HAVING BEEN PASSED IN 1949. THE 2 LAWS ARE COMPARED AND
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM AND REASONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW LAW ARE
DISCUSSED. THE NEW LAW BRINGS CHANGES NOT ONLY IN THE NUMBER OF COPIES
PUBLISHERS WILL NOW HAVE TO DEPOSIT OF BOOKS (NOW 7, PREVIOUSLY 5) BUT ALSO
WIDENS THE RANGE OF DEPOSIT MATERIALS. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES CONNECTED
WITH THE DEPOSITS ARE MENTIONED.
TWO YEARS OF DEALING WITH SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS.
     
DESCRIBES HOW LINKOPING UNIVERSITY LIBRARY COPES WITH THE DEPOSIT COPIES OF
200,000 SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR WHICH IT HAS BEEN RECEIVING SINCE IT
BECAME A DEPOSIT LIBRARY ON 1 JAN 79. BY USING THE LIST OF SWEDISH PERIODICALS
SOME PRIOR CATALOGUING COULD BE DONE. A PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIAL
ACCORDING TO SUBJECT TO THE 7 UNITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WAS DRAWN UP. AFTER 2 YEARS SOME PUBLISHERS ARE STILL NOT AWARE OF THEIR DUTY
TO DELIVER, AND ROUTINES FOR CLAIMING HAVE HAD TO BE DEVELOPED. THE MONOGRAPH
COPIES RECEIVED ARE INTENDED AS REGIONAL COPIES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHER
INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION, OR COPIES FOR USE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY; A
POLICY OF WITHDRAWAL WAS DEVELOPED, AS NO ARCHIVAL DUTY EXISTS. PROBLEMS WERE
CAUSED BY THE NUMBER AND LATE DELIVERY OF PERIODICALS. HANDLING OF LEAFLETS
AND OTHER EPHEMERA HAS PROVED MOST COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING, AND THIS
MATERIAL REMAINS UNCATALOGUED. THE QUESTION OF ITS FUTURE NEEDS URGENTLY TO BE
DECIDED.
STUDIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS.
     
COLLECTION OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT MEETINGS OF THE IFLA SECTION ON THE EXCHANGE
OF PUBLICATIONS, (NOW THE SECTION ON EXCHANGE AND ACQUISITION), ON SUBJECTS
RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS. 'UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS AND THE SECTION ON THE EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS', BY PETER
GENZEL; 'INTERNATIONAL BOOK EXCHANGE OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES IN THE LATE 70S',
BY B.P. KANEVSKY; 'THE MULTILATERAL UNESCO EXCHANGE CONVENTIONS (1958) AND
THEIR INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE', BY VLADIMIR POPOV; 'EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES', BY FRANS VANWIJNGAERDEN; 'THE USE OF
PHOTOREPRODUCTIONS IN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE', BY NATHAN R. EINHORN; 'A

ALLARDYCE; 'A COSTING ANALYSIS OF THE GIFT AND EXCHANGE SECTION OF THE BRITISH
LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION', BY E. TATTERTON, K. KING AND A. ALLARDYCE (BASED ON
AN INTERNAL REPORT BY R. STEEMSON ); 'THE CATALOGUING OF DONATED MONOGRAPHS AT
THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION', BY M. BARWICK AND A. ALLARDYCE; 'THE

STUDY, BY RITA EJLERSEN; 'THE ECONOMICS OF UNIVERSAL SERIALS AND BOOK EXCHANGE
(USBE)', BY HOWARD ROVELSTAD; 'RISING BOOK PRICES AND THE EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS', BY MARIA RAZUMOVSKY.
COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SOVIET SERIAL EXCHANGES.
     
WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW HAS BEEN THAT SOVIET PUBLICATIONS WERE BEST
ACQUIRED THROUGH EXCHANGES, A RECENT REVIEW OF SOVIET SERIALS AT DUKE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY NO LONGER BE AS TRUE AS IT ONCE WAS.
THE AVAILABILITY OF SOVIET PUBLICATIONS THROUGH NORMAL TRADE CHANNELS HAS
INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING
EQUITABLE EXCHANGES IN ECONOMIC TERMS HAS INCREASED. OUR EXAMINATION HAS SHOWN
THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT SUCH EXCHANGES ARE EQUITABLE. REGULAR
REVIEWS ARE RECOMMENDED TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES BEST.
RD MEETING OF SPECIALISTS FROM SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ON UNION CATALOGUES AND
INTERLIBRARY LOANS.R
     
EPORTS ON THE 3RD MEETING HELD IN BERLIN 28-30 OCT 80. PARTICIPANTS FROM
NATIONAL LIBRARIES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE USSR GATHERED TO EXCHANGE THEIR
EXPERIENCES WITH INTERLIBRARY LENDING AND UNION CATALOGUES WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE UAP PROGRAMME. DISCUSSIONS CONNECTED WITH THE SETTING UP OF A
COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL INTERLIBRARY LOAN SYSTEM IN THE FRAMEWORK OF UNISIST
CULMINATED IN THE RESOLUTION TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS AREA. A 5 YEAR
DEVELOPMENT PLAN, ON THE WORK OF INTERLIBRARY LENDING SERVICES AND UNION
CATALOGUES IN NATIONAL LIBRARIES IN THE PERIOD 1981-85, WAS ADOPTED.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING OR DOCUMENT SUPPLY IN THE 1980S.
     
EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE ISSUE
LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA ARE FACING IS THE MUCH WIDER ONE OF DOCUMENT SUPPLY.
WHILE THE INTERLIBRARY LENDING PROCEDURES WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AS AN
EXPRESSION OF VOLUNTARY COOPERATION BASED ON GOODWILL WERE ADEQUATE IN THE
1930S AND 1940S, THEY BECAME INADEQUATE IN THE 1960S AND 1970S AND WILL BRING
DISASTER, IF RETAINED, IN THE 1980S.
INTERLIBRARY LOAN STATISTICS FROM FRENCH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES (1975-1980).
     
A PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FIGURES AVAILABLE, DRAWN FROM PUBLISHED
OFFICIAL STATISTICS FROM 1975-78, AND STATISTICS FOR 1980 FROM NANCY
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. PRELIMINARY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE
TO UNIVERSITIES' TELEX, UNION CATALOGUES, AND THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THE
BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, PARIS TEACHING HOSPITALS, AND THE
NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. STATISTICAL DATA COVER' TOTAL ANNUAL
VOLUMES OF LOANS, NUMBER OF LIBRARIES PARTICIPATING, THE ANNUAL VOLUME OF
LOANS AT NANCY IN 1980, THE PERCENTAGE SUCCESS RATES, BREAKDOWN BY SUBJECTS,
TYPES OF DOCUMENTS, INCREASE IN THESIS LOANS AT NANCY, AND INCREASE IN
PHOTOCOPY USE. FURTHER INFORMATION COVERS EXCHANGES WITH FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES'
TOTAL VOLUMES OF LOANS, TYPES OF DOCUMENTS, SUBJECT BREAKDOWN, FOREIGN
LIBRARIES INVOLVED, AND PHOTOCOPYING. A FINAL SECTION ANALYSES IN DETAIL THE
FIGURES FROM NANCY. IN CONCLU SION, COLLATES THE FACTUAL EVIDENCE SHOWN BY THE
STATISTICS, AND COMMENTS ON THE INCREASE IN INTERLIBRARY LOAN IN THIS FIELD AS
AN ASPECT OF DEVELOPING NETWORK COOPERATION.
DOCUMENT ACCESS IN FRANCE.
     
AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRESENT UNSATISFACTORY SITUATION, AND THE MEASURES IN
HAND TO AMELIORATE IT. A BRIEF STATISTICAL INTRODUCTION SHOWS THE LOW VOLUME
OF INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN GENERAL, THEN THE OPERATIONS OF THE 3 CHIEF DOCUMENT
SUPPLIERS ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL' THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CENTRE'S
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE; THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S LOAN
CENTRE; AND CADIST, THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED UNIVERSITY NETWORK. DETAILS ARE
GIVEN IN EACH CASE OF SERVICES, POLICIES, SUCCESS RATES, AND LOAN STATISTICS;
RECENT AND PROJECTED REORGANISATION PLANS IN HAND AT THE 2 OLDER CENTRES ARE
DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO SERVICE DEFECTS, AND THE ANTICIPATED OVERALL
FACILITATION OF DOCUMENT ACCESS ONCE CADIST BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL. FINALLY
EXISTING NATIONAL CATALOGUE RESOURCES ARE DESCRIBED AND ANALYSED, WITH DETAILS
OF AUTOMATION POLICIES AND PROJECTS TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE SUBJECT COVERAGE AND
ACCESS.
SURVEY OF THE PERIODICAL STOCK AT THE LIBRARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC
HEALTH.
     
THE GROWTH OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OBJECTIVES AND
RESEARCH TEAM, THE LACK OF SPACE AND THE RISE IN JOURNAL PRICES INDUCED THE
LIBRARIANS TO EXAMINE THE USAGE OF JOURNALS. THEY WISHED TO ESTABLISH JOURNALS
WHICH NEED NOT BE SUBSCRIBED TO ANY LONGER; JOURNALS WHICH COULD BE PLACED IN
REMOTE STORAGE; AND JOURNALS WHICH READERS REGULARLY REQUIRE BUT WHICH ARE NOT
AVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1 NOV 77 -30 APR 78. AS A
RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION IT CAN BE LAID DOWN THAT THE LIBRARY CAN COMPLY,
FROM ITS OWN STOCK, WITH A LARGE PART OF READERS' DEMANDS FOR JOURNALS. THE
SMALLER PART (29%) OF THE STOCK FULFILS 77% OF DEMANDS, THE LARGER PROPORTION
IS LITTLE USED. THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS NOT USED AT ALL IS SMALL. JOURNALS USED
LESS WILL BE PUT IN DISTANT STACKS; CURRENT JOURNALS AND OFTEN USED VOLUMES
WILL BE STORED IN THE LIBRARY.
ACQUISITION AND WITHDRAWAL POLICY' METHODOLOGY FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES.
     
BASED ON A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION IN INFORMATION SCIENCE, REPORTING ON A STUDY
CARRIED OUT AT A BRAZILIAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE. TO EVALUATE THE ADEQUACY OF THE
COLLECTION IN MEETING USER NEEDS, USER INTEREST PROFILES, COLLECTION BIAS, AND
INTENSITY OF USE WERE COMPARED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, DATA
COLLECTION PROCEDURES, AND CALCULATIONS; RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN FULL. THE
APPLICATION OF THE INFORMATION OBTAINED TO FORMULATION OF ACQUISITION AND
WITHDRAWAL POLICIES BY CHECKING COLLECTION GROWTH AGAINST USER INTEREST
PATTERNS IS DEMONSTRATED. THE METHODOLOGY IS RECOMMENDED AS A DYNAMIC MODEL
FOR MONITORING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.
ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT PERIODICALS COLLECTION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE CENTRE
FOR DATA PROCESSING IN POSTGRADUATE COMPUTER SCIENCE (CPD/PGCC) AT UFRS,
BRAZIL' METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THE COMPOSITION
OF THE NUCLEAR COLLECTION, THEN TO ESTABLISH INTEREST PROFILES AND CRITERIA
FOR WEEDING AND ACQUISITION OF NEW TITLES. DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM LIBRARY
RECORDS AND BY INTERVIEWS WITH THE HEADS OF RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS. IN ADDITION
TO REALISING THE INITIAL OBJECTIVES, THE SURVEY ALSO DREW ATTENTION TO A GROUP
OF PERIODICALS OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE, TO BE MONITORED FOR POSSIBLE WEEDING.
COLLABORATION WITH THE RESEARCH WORKERS WAS FOUND VERY USEFUL, AND A POLICY OF
FURTHER COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND RESEARCH STAFF INITIATED. THE RESULTS
OF THE STUDY ARE PRESENTED IN FULL IN THE APPENDIX.
LIBRARIAN AND CONSERVATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE CONTROL OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH CAN CAUSE DETERIORATION IN
LIBRARY MATERIALS. THESE INCLUDE' CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT; LIGHT; DUST;
ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION; INSECTS; MICRO-ORGANISMS; AND ACIDITY. SUGGESTS A
NUMBER OF MEASURES WHICH CAN BE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND CONTROL DETERIORATION
CAUSED BY THESE FACTORS, AND STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING EDUCATION
AND RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.
DISASTERS' PREVENTION AND COPING. PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE, 21-22 MAY,
1980.
     
PAPERS PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE DESIGNED TO ALERT LIBRARIANS WHO ARE NOT
EXPERT IN CONSERVATION MATTERS TO THE MAJOR HAZARDS FACING LIBRARY
COLLECTIONS. POSSIBLE CAUSES OF SEVERE DAMAGE INCLUDE FIRE, WATER AND INSECT
PESTS.
THE FATE OF OUR GRAPHIC RECORDS DEPENDS ON.
     
DISCUSSES SOME STEPS WHICH US LIBRARIANS ARE TAKING TO TRY AND SOLVE THE
PROBLEM OF THE RAPID DETERIORATION OF GRAPHIC MATERIALS. ARGUES THAT
LIBRARIANSHIP EDUCATION DURING THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN EMPHASISING SERVICES,
ADMINISTRATION, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND NONPRINT MEDIA, AND PAID LITTLE
ATTENTION TO THE TRANSMISSION OF IDEAS, AND THE CAUSES WHICH LEAD TO THE
DISAPPEARANCE, PRESERVATION, AND REINTERPRETATION OF THESE IDEAS. URGES
LIBRARIANS TO SHARE AND VALUE A SENSE OF HISTORY, WHICH IS SEEN AS THE ONE AND
MOST IMPORTANT UNIFYING ELEMENT WHICH WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THEIR GRAPHIC
RECORDS.
BOOKBINDING AND CONSERVATION BY HAND' A WORKING GUIDE.
     
PRACTICAL MANUAL FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, AN INSTRUCTION GUIDE TO BE
FOLLOWED BY THE BEGINNER ATTEMPTING TO LEARN BINDING AND A READY REFERENCE FOR
EXPERIENCED BINDERS, BOOK COLLECTORS, BOOK DEALERS AND LIBRARIANS.
THE EVALUATION OF PERIODICAL CIRCULATION' AN ANALYSIS OF LOAN REQUESTS FROM
INTERNAL USERS.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT IN A BRAZILIAN RESEARCH LIBRARY, TO ESTABLISH
THE RATE OF USER SATISFACTION AND ANALYSE THE REASONS FOR FAILURES. THE
IMPORTANCE OF QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF USER SATISFACTION IS DISCUSSED WITH
REFERENCE TO A MAJOR SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS IN BRAZILIAN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES, WHICH GENERATED THIS STUDY. LOAN REQUEST PROCEDURES AND USER
REGISTRATION DOCUMENTATION ARE DESCRIBED TO EXPLAIN THE METHODS USED TO
COLLECT DATA. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESES, BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, ARE
PRESENTED AND DETAILS GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY USED. THE FORMULAE APPLIED TO
ANALYSE THE DATA ARE EXPLAINED AND CALCULATIONS OF RESULTS PRESENTED IN FULL,
SHOWING SATISFACTION RATES. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF REQUEST FAILURES WITH
REFERENCE TO PUBLICATION DATA AND USER INFORMATION SHOWED BOTH INADEQUACIES IN
THE COLLECTION AND INACCURACIES IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY
USERS.
COPYRIGHT AND ACADEMIC LIBRARY COPYING.
     
THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES CARRIED OUT A SMALL SURVEY
OF 140 SELECTED COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TO IDENTIFY CURRENT POLICIES
AND PHOTOCOPYING PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO THE NEW COPYRIGHT LAW PROVISIONS.
MODEL POLICY CONCERNING COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PHOTOCOPYING FOR CLASSROOM,
RESEARCH AND LIBRARY RESERVE USE.
     
PRESENTS A MODEL POLICY FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PHOTOCOPYING,
PREPARED BY THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WITH ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE FROM
COPYRIGHT LAWYERS AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. OUTLINES FAIR USE RIGHTS IN THE
ACADEMIC CONTEXT (E.G. FOR CLASSROOM TEACHING, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND LIBRARY
SERVICES) IN THE HOPE THAT LIBRARIANS AND UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS WILL USE
THE STATEMENT AS A MODEL FOR THEIR OWN COPYRIGHT PHOTOCOPYING POLICIES.
ON SELECTION AND COMBINING OF RELEVANCE INDICATORS.
     
IDENTIFYING AND REPRESENTING THE CONTENT OF A DOCUMENT IS ONE OF THE MAIN
CONCERNS OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. DISCUSSES THE ATTRIBUTES OF ALL THE
ITEMS IN THE DATA BASE. IF THE ATTRIBUTES ARE NOT TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OR
HIGHLY CORRELATED, THEN COMBINING THEM IN A CERTAIN WAY MAY INCREASE
EFFECTIVENESS. JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS COMES FROM THE USERS' INFORMATION
SEEKING BEHAVIOUR' USERS EMPLOY INDEX TERMS, AUTHORS' NAMES, CITATIONS AND
OTHER ATTRIBUTES. FORMULATES A MODEL TO COVER THIS HYPOTHESIS.
CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE.
     
TEXT OF A PAPER DELIVERED AT A SYMPOSIUM IN CUBA'S NATIONAL LIBRARY IN 1978
DESCRIBING THE GROWTH OF THE COLLECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS FOR
ORGANISING THE DOCUMENTS. THE ARCHIVE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE MID-19TH CENTURY
BUT HOUSES MATERIAL DATING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SPANISH COLONIAL
EPOCH. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE VARIOUS CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATION AND
ATTENDANT INNOVATIONS IN OFFICIAL REGULATIONS REGARDING THE ARCHIVE WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION. THE
PROBLEMS OF DEALING WITH 20TH CENTURY MATERIAL ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED, AND
FUTURE PROJECTS FOR REORGANISATION UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A SOVIET EXPERT ARE
DISCUSSED.
IS THERE A CATALOG IN YOUR FUTURE? ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN THE YEAR 2006.
     
CONSIDERS THE STATE OF THE ART OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ASSESSES TRENDS,
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PREDICTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THESE PREDICTIONS TO THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOGUE ARE CONSIDERED.
CATALOGUING RARE AND VALUABLE WORKS.
     
DESCRIBES THE CATALOGUING PROCEDURES DEVELOPED FOR DEALING WITH THE VARIED
TYPES OF MATERIAL ACQUIRED BY A BRAZILIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF THE INITIAL ANALYSIS OF A NEW ITEM AND ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY IT. THE
CATALOGUING PROCEDURES ARE PRESENTED IN FULL, WITH A WORKED EXAMPLE SHOWING
HOW EACH OF THE 5 PRINCIPLE ELEMENTS IS TREATED.
A GUIDE TO REFERENCE TOOLS FOR CATALOGING AFRICANA.
     
AFRICANA MATERIALS ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO CATALOGUE. THE NUMBER OF
PUBLICATIONS ABOUT AND FROM AFRICA HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY IN THE LAST 2
DECADES, PROPORTIONATELY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PROBLEM BOOKS. ALTHOUGH MUCH
HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AFRICANA, VERY LITTLE
ACTUALLY AIDS THE CATALOGUER IN FINDING ANSWERS TO THE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS
RAISED BY THESE MATERIALS. ANSWERS ARE FOUND IN SCATTERED AND SOMETIMES
OBSCURE PUBLICATIONS. THERE HAS LONG BEEN A NEED FOR A GUIDE TO THESE SOURCES
OF INFORMATION. HERE IS SUCH A GUIDE, COMPILED WITH THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE
GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST CATALOGUER IN MIND.
THE CATALOGUING OF MANUSCRIPTS IN BAVARIA.
     
THERE ARE ABOUT 73,000 MANUSCRIPTS IN BAVARIA, 1/3 OF THE TOTAL NUMBER IN
GERMANY. THE HISTORY OF MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUING IN BAVARIA SINCE THE 11TH
CENTURY IS DESCRIBED; EFFORTS IN CATALOGUING MUST BE MAINTAINED AND IF
POSSIBLE INCREASED. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF STOCKS, MAINLY GERMAN AND LATIN
MATERIAL, AND PROGRESS IN CATALOGUING ARE INCLUDED FOR' THE BAVARIAN STATE
LIBRARY; THE COURT AND RELIGIOUS FOUNDATION LIBRARY AT ASCHAFFENBURG; AUGSBURG
STATE AND MUNICIPAL LIBRARY; AUGSBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; BAMBERG STATE
LIBRARY; COBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY; EICHSTATT STATE AND SEMINARY LIBRARY;
UNIVERSITY OF ERLANGEN, NUREMBERG; MUNICH UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; NUREMBERG PUBLIC
LIBRARY; THE GERMANIC NATIONAL MUSEUM, NUREMBERG; WURZBURG UNIVERSITY; AND
OTHER SMALL COLLECTIONS.
THE LATIN MANUSCRIPT FRAGMENTS IN THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY.
     
A COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPT FRAGMENTS HAS BEEN HOUSED IN THE BAVARIAN STATE
LIBRARY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 19TH CENTURY. IN THE 1860S AN INDEX WAS
MADE BY FRIEDRICH KEIN, USING A SCIENTIFIC ARRANGEMENT CLEARLY SEPARATING THE
CLASSICAL FROM THE MEDIAEVAL. IN 1977 A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF THE LATIN
FRAGMENTS WAS CREATED TO ALLOW MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF EACH DOCUMENT AND AN
INDEX COMPILED WHICH AT PRESENT CONTAINS 2,810 ITEMS. THE RANGE OF SIGNATURE
NUMBERS WAS EXTENDED, A CONCORDANCE BEING PROVIDED TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERY
OF TEXTS CITED UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM. INDEXES OF AUTHORS, ANONYMA, PLACES OF
ORIGIN, SIGNATURES, MINIATURES AND INITIALS ARE INCLUDED. THE INDEX MAY BE
MADE INTO A PRINTED CATALOGUE.
CONVENTIONAL CATALOGUING TECHNIQUES AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
TAKING THE CATALOGUING OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS USING PRACTICES EVOLVED FOR
PRINTED DOCUMENTS AS A STARTING POINT, CONSIDERS THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON
RESEARCH WHEN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED THROUGH THE
RESTRICTED APPROACHES PERMITTED BY STANDARD REDUCTIVE CATALOGUING CODES.
ATTEMPTS TO APPLY CONVENTIONAL CATALOGUING PROCEDURES TO AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL
REQUIRE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF IMAGES AND SOUNDS INTO TEXTUAL EQUIVALENTS, FOR
INTEGRATION WITH THE EXISTING COLLECTION OF WRITTEN DOCUMENTS. SEARCHING BY
PURELY VISUAL OR AUDIO QUALITIES IS IMPOSSIBLE. EQUALLY, WRITTEN DOCUMENTS CAN
ONLY BE ACCESSED BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF ESTABLISHED APPROACHES. REFERENCE IS
MADE TO RECENT PUBLISHED DISCUSSION OF PROBLEMS IN AUDIO-VISUAL CATALOGUING
AND STRATEGIES TO SOLVE THEM.
THE CATALOGUING OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS IN OLD BAVARIA AND SWABIA.
     
THROUGH THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES IN 1803, BAVARIAN LIBRARIES
ACQUIRED MANY MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS, MAINLY OF CHORAL AND INSTRUMENTAL WORKS FROM
ABOUT 1750 ONWARDS. SINCE 1958 RENEWED EFFORTS AT CATALOGUING HAVE BEEN MADE,
WITH HELP, SINCE 1964, FROM THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN
RESEARCH ASSOCIATION) AND THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY. SINCE 1971 3 CATALOGUE
SECTIONS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND OTHERS ARE IN COURSE OF PREPARATION. THE
CATALOGUES ARE IMPORTANT SINCE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC IS RARELY FOUND IN PUBLIC
COLLECTIONS; BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES OF LITTLE-KNOWN COMPOSERS ARE INCLUDED. THE
COLLECTION ALSO INCLUDES EARLY WORKS BY WELL-KNOWN COMPOSERS SUCH AS MOZART
AND MICHAEL HAYDN. 3 COLLECTIONS OWNED BY NOBLE FAMILIES AND SOME MATERIAL
BELONGING TO THE NATION ARE ALSO RECORDED. THE 6 VOLUMES ALREADY PUBLISHED OF
THE 2CATALOGUE OF BAVARIAN MUSIC COLLECTIONS1 ARE DESCRIBED.
THE CATALOGUING OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS IN FRANCONIA.
     
CATALOGUING OF MUSIC MANUSCRIPTS IN FRANCONIA WAS BEGUN IN 1977 BY THE
WURZBURG UNIVERSITY. THE CATALOGUE PROVIDES LISTS OF LOCATIONS IN ROMAN
CATHOLIC AND EVANGELICAL PARISH CHURCHES. MOST OF THE 1,550 ROMAN CATHOLIC
ITEMS ARE SETTINGS OF THE MASS; THERE IS LITTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC APART FROM
SOME 19TH CENTURY ORGAN PIECES. THE 600 MANUSCRIPTS FROM EVANGELICAL CHURCHES
ARE MOSTLY IN THE ROSSACH COLLECTION, DATING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE 18TH
CENTURY. MANY COMPOSITIONS ARE BY WELL-KNOWN COMPOSERS FROM OUTSIDE FRANCONIA
OF THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES. COLLECTIONS OWNED BY NOBLE FAMILIES CONTAIN
MOSTLY SECULAR SONGS, PIANO AND CHAMBER MUSIC. MOST OF THE MANUSCRIPTS ARE IN
GOOD CONDITION; A FEW SUFFERING FROM DAMP REQUIRED LABORATORY TREATMENT. THE
PRINTED MUSIC DOCUMENTED AT THE SAME TIME WAS MOSTLY FROM THE 19TH CENTURY.
AUTHORITY CONTROL IN TWO LANGUAGES.
     
PREPARED FOR THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE
'AUTHORITY CONTROL-THE KEY TO TOMORROW'S CATALOGUE', ATLANTIC CITY, NEW
JERSEY, 21-23 MAY 79. WITH REFERENCE TO CANADA'S EXPERIENCES, REVIEWS SOME
REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF BILINGUAL CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
AND HIGHLIGHTS POLICY OPTIONS INVOLVED. DESCRIBES THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF
BILINGUALISM IN NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CANADA BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES AND
PRODUCTS, FOCUSES ON SOME TECHNICAL FEATURES OF THE AUTHORITY SUBSYSTEM OF THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY'S AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM, AND BRIEFLY LOOKS AT THE
FUTURE.
THE AUTOMATION OF TECHNICAL SERVICES IN VENEZUELA'S NATIONAL LIBRARY' ASPECTS
OF A TRANSFER OF LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY.
     
DEALS WITH THE ORGANISATION OF AN ACQUISITIONS PROJECT FOR THE VENEZUELAN
NATIONAL LIBRARY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT INTO A MEANS OF AUTOMATING ITS
CATALOGUING OPERATIONS. THE VENEZUELA PROJECT, CARRIED OUT AT NORTHWESTERN
UNIVERSITY FROM 1976-79, AND ITS IMPACT ON VENEZUELA'S TECHNICAL SERVICES ARE
DESCRIBED. OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF THE NEW SYSTEM FOR
SETTING UP A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND INFORMATION NETWORK AND FOR SOLVING
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HINDERING THE USE OF CENTRALISED CATALOGUING IN LATIN
AMERICAN LIBRARIES.
TEN YEARS OF ISDS.
     
IN 1967 ICSU SET UP UNISIST TO EXAMINE POSSIBLE WAYS OF CREATING A WORLDWIDE
INFORMATION SYSTEM. ISDS WAS SET UP AS A PART OF UNISIST IN 1971 WITH THE
INTERNATIONAL CENTRE IN PARIS. THE 1ST NATIONAL CENTRE WAS SET UP IN THE USA.
THE NATIONAL CENTRES NOW NUMBER 45. THE FINNISH CENTRE STARTED IN 1975. MEMBER
COUNTRIES PAY A FEE. FINLAND'S ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION IS ABOUT 19,000 MARKS. ISDS
CENTRE ALSO EARNS MONEY BY SELLING PUBLICATIONS. ISDS CENTRE COORDINATES THE
WORK OF THE NATIONAL CENTRES. IT PUBLISHES ISDS REGISTER AND BULLETIN. IN 1981
THE REGISTER CONTAINED ABOUT 120,000 ITEMS. THE CENTRE COOPERATES WITH OTHER
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS. THE NATIONAL CENTRES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
CATALOGUING SERIALS FOR ISDS AND MAINTAINING DATA BASES FOR NATIONAL SERIAL
PUBLICATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME AREA CENTRES, E.G. IN MOSCOW, WHICH COVERS
THE USSR, HUNGARY, BULGARIA, EAST GERMANY, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, CUBA, AND MONGOLIA.
THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE CATALOGUES BY ISDS MANUAL, WHICH DIFFE RS FROM
ISBD(S). FINNISH MATERIALS ARE CATALOGUED BY ISBD(S). DIFFICULTIES IN
COMBINING THE 2 SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS OF SERIALS ARE DISCUSSED.
A CATALOGUING MANUAL FOR AUSTRALIA.
     
BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE PROJECT TO COMPUTERISE AUSTRALIA'S PUBLIC ART
COLLECTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 2CATALOGUER'S MANUAL FOR THE VISUAL
ARTS. 1THE WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE CATALOGUE AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL COMMITTEE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GALLERY DIRECTORS COUNCIL.
A GERMAN SYSTEM OF PROGRAMS FOR AUTOMATED INTEGRATED LIBRARY OPERATIONS.
     
TRANSLATION OF AN ITALIAN ARTICLE DESCRIBING THE SIEMENS COMPANY'S BIKAS 2
SYSTEM WHICH COMPRISES A SERIES OF SUB-PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE CATALOGUES
AND VARIOUS TYPES OF SPECIALISED LISTS, IN BOTH MICROFORM AND HARD COPY.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE INPUT PROCEDURE, WHICH CREATES A SINGLE BASIC FILE
WITH A WIDE SELECTION OF ACCESS POINTS. BIKAS 2 IS INTENDED TO FUNCTION WITH
THE ON-LINE BIBLIOTHEKS-VERBUNDSYSTEM, WHICH COORDINATES THE ACTIVITIES OF A
NUMBER OF LIBRARIES INTO AN INTEGRATED NETWORK, WHATEVER THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL
LOCATION.
PROBLEMS IN THE STANDARDISATION OF TITLE ENTRIES IN CATALOGUING NETWORKS.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CENTRAL TITLE CATALOGUE FREE OF REDUNDANCIES, AND IN
WHICH TITLES WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONAL REFERENCES OCCUR ONLY ONCE, IS POSSIBLE
WITHIN A COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING NETWORK, WHERE THE WORK LOAD IS DISTRIBUTED
ONLY THROUGH STANDARDISATION OF THE ENTRY FORM. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE DETECTION
AND PREVENTION OF MULTIPLE REFERENCES IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. DESCRIBES THE
CURRENT STATUS OF NETWORK CATALOGUING IN WEST GERMANY, THE
MONOGRAPH-CATALOGUING NETWORKS IN NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA, BAVARIA, AND OCLC.
THE MORE INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF THESE PROBLEMS WHICH THEREBY BECOME
APPARENT, REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFORM TITLE ENTRIES, TAKES INTO
ACCOUNT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF DATA PROCESSING, SPECIFIC LIBRARY ASPECTS,
AND ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS. THUS CAN A REALISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OF USING DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES BE ACHIEVED.
THE ROLE OF LIBRARY COOPERATIVES IN AN AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK.
     
REVIEWS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK (ABN) FOR
EXISTING COOPERATIVES SUCH AS CLANN AND CAVAL. THE PERSONAL VIEW OF THE AUTHOR
IS THAT ACCESS TO ABN WILL ENHANCE RATHER THAN DIMINISH THE LONG-TERM ROLE OF
SUCH COOPERATIVES, ALTHOUGH SOME RATIONALISATION OF AUTONOMY AND INVESTMENT
UNDERTAKEN HITHERTO WILL BE NECESSARY.
HOW HUMAN-USABLE IS INTERCHANGEABLE? OR, SHALL WE PRODUCE CATALOGUES OR
BABELOGRAPHIC TOWERS?.
     
A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS, LIKE THE PARIS PRINCIPLES,
THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS, AND THE ISO STANDARD
FOR ABBREVIATIONS, ARE EVALUATED IN THE LIGHT OF UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL. THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS
(CULTURAL, LINGUISTICS, ETC.) OF THE HETEROGENEOUS UBC PUBLIC IN MIND.
EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE AND POSSIBILITIES OF AUTHORITY FILES AS SEARCH KEYS
TO BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS AND SUGGESTS THAT UNIVERSAL UNIFORM HEADINGS BE
REPLACED BY INTERNATIONAL STANDARD CONTROL FORMS. WITH REGARD TO BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DESCRIPTIONS, THE MULTIPURPOSE USE OF (AUTOMATICALLY) TRANSLATABLE DESCRIPTIVE
INFORMATION IS PROPOSED.
ISBD' ORIGINS, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE IN 1979 GIVING A FACTUAL ACCOUNT
WITH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DOCUMENTATION OF HOW THE CONCEPT OF ISBD EMERGED AND
GAINED INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE. REFERENCE IS MADE TO MAJOR CONFERENCE
DECISIONS FROM 1961 ONWARDS, AND TO IMPORTANT WORKING PARTY RECOMMENDATIONS.
THE PURPOSE OF ISBD IS CLARIFIED AND SPECIALISED USES OUTLINED. PARTICULAR
REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE ADOPTION OF ISBD IN BRAZIL IN RELATION TO THE
INCREASING INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION.
THE HISTORY AND IMPACT OF ISBD.
     
TRACES THE NEED FOR AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION PROGRAMME. THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE DIFFERENT ISBDS
IS REVIEWED. BRIEFLY POINTS OUT THE EARLY CRITICISMS OF ISBD, ITS FINAL
ACCEPTANCE, AND THE MANY BENEFITS IT HAS BROUGHT.
THE CATALOGUE OF AN 18TH CENTURY READING LIBRARY.
     
THE READING LIBRARIES WERE FORERUNNERS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY; THEY WERE
FOUNDED IN THE 18TH CENTURY, AT THE TIME OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, AS
PROFIT-MAKING INSTITUTIONS BY MIDDLE-CLASS CITIZENS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND
RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. THE CATALOGUE OF 1 SUCH LIBRARY, DIE ARNOLDSCHE
BIBLIOTHEK IN BUDISSEN, 1799-1806, IS 1 OF THE RARE BOOKS IN THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY OF POTSDAM. COMPRISING A MAIN VOLUME AND 13 SUPPLEMENTS, IT LISTS
7,000 TITLES IN ACCESSION ORDER. THE LIBRARY STOCKED MAINLY FICTION FROM
GERMANY AND ABROAD, OF WHICH SOME WORKS HAVE NOW BECOME CLASSICS. THE FICTION
STOCK ALSO REFLECTED THE CONTEMPORARY ENTHUSIASM FOR TALES ABOUT MEDIAEVAL
CHIVALRY AND THE SUPERNATURAL. THERE WERE ALSO ABOUT 400 DRAMATIC WORKS AND
100 ON TRAVEL AND CONTEMPORARY HISTORY.
REVIEWS ON MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUES.
     
SINCE 1945 69 VOLUMES OF MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN WEST
GERMANY, MANY OF THEM FUNDED BY THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY. 236 INDIVIDUAL
REVIEWS OF THE MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUES APPEARED IN 61 JOURNALS. THESE WERE LOCAL
AND REGIONAL JOURNALS, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JOURNALS AND SPECIALIST
SUBJECT JOURNALS. THE MAJORITY OF THE REVIEWS WERE IN GERMAN; THERE WAS LITTLE
RESPONSE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES EXCEPT FRANCE. THE MOST POPULAR FORMS OF REVIEW
WAS A REPORT WITH AN EVALUATION OR SHORT NOTES. THE MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUE
REVIEWS ARE OF INTEREST TO 4 MAIN GROUPS' THE AUTHOR, THE LIBRARIES
(ESPECIALLY THE MANUSCRIPT DEPARTMENTS), THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY WITH
THEIR LIBRARY DEPARTMENT AND SUB-COMMITTEE, AND THE PUBLISHERS.
PATRON APPROACHES TO SERIALS' A USER STUDY.
     
ALTHOUGH MANY CATALOGUE USE STUDIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, THOSE LIMITED TO
PATRON SUCCESS WITH LOCATING SERIALS HAVE BEEN UNCOMMON. THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED
AT A SEPARATE SERIAL CARD CATALOGUE IN A MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARY, MEASURES THE
SUCCESS OF MORE THAN 400 PATRONS IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL OF SERIALS.
THE AUTHORS INTERVIEWED PATRONS AND THEN ANALYZED THE DATA IN AN ATTEMPT TO
DETERMINE HOW PATRONS APPROACH A CARD CATALOGUE WHEN SEARCHING FOR SERIALS,
THEIR SUCCESS RATE, AND REASONS FOR THEIR SUCCESSES AND FAILURES.
INVESTIGATION OF SEARCH CODES (MATCHCODING) FOR CATALOGUE DATA.
     
DURING THE PLANNING FOR THE INCORPORATION OF DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES, THE
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IS AIDED THROUGH THE USE OF BASIC DATA. PRESENTS AN
EVALUATION OF ABOUT 442,000 MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE ENTRIES FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ LIBRARY. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND BEHAVIOUR OF VARIOUS
SEARCH CODES (MATCHCODES) DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT DATA CATEGORIES WERE
ANALYSED CONCERNING THEIR PERFORMANCE WITHIN AN EXPANDING DATA BASE AND IN
JUXTAPOSITION WITH ONE ANOTHER. FURTHERMORE, THE FREQUENCY OF IDENTICAL DATA
AND THEIR LENGTH WAS NOTED. RESULTS SHOWED THAT CLEAR DISTINCTIONS CAN BE
ATTAINED IF TYPES OF SEARCH CODES ARE ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC DATA GROUPS; STOP
LIST SUPPORT IS, HOWEVER, NECESSARY FOR DYNAMIC MATCHCODES.
REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND ITS COM CATALOGUES.
     
BASED ON A STUDY TOUR REPORT, PROVIDES A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIENCES
OF THE REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (WEST GERMANY), GAINED DURING THE
PREPARATION AND USE OF COM CATALOGUES.
SOME CRITERIA OF THE SELECTION OF MICROFICHE READERS FOR LIBRARIES.
     
WITH THE AIM OF PROMOTING COM TECHNOLOGY IN HUNGARY, PRESENTS DETAILED
SPECIFICATIONS OF SEVERAL MICROFICHE READERS TO HELP THE SELECTION OF
APPROPRIATE DEVICES FOR LIBRARY USE. GIVES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RELEVANT
STANDARDS, THE MAIN TYPES OF READERS, AND SOME CRITERIA CONCERNING THEIR
QUALITY AND APPLICATION AS WELL AS THE HUMAN ASPECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF
COM TECHNOLOGY.
AACR2 AND THEIR EFFECT UPON ISRAELI LIBRARIES (IN HEBREW).
     
A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF AACR2 OPENS THE ARTICLE. THE RULES ARE THE RESULT OF A
DESIRE FOR TRUE INTERNATIONAL UNIFORMITY, THOUGH THEY ARE STILL
'ANGLO-AMERICAN' IN THEIR PREFERENCE OF ENGLISH FORMS. AACR2 GIVES EQUAL
STATUS TO BOOK AND NON-BOOK MATERIALS. THERE IS MUCH LESS STRESS ON
'AUTHORSHIP' AND MORE ON 'RESPONSIBILITY'. THE UNIFORM STRUCTURE OF ALL
CHAPTERS IS DESCRIBED. DESCRIBES IMPORTANT CHANGES-AS COMPARED TO AACR1-IN
RULES FOR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING AND HEADINGS. SOME RESERVATIONS ARE MADE
ABOUT HEADINGS FOR JEWISH RELIGIOUS WORKS. THE DECISION BY LC TO CARRY OUT
'DESUPERIMPOSITION' AND TO CLOSE ITS CATALOGUE IS NOTED, AND ITS EFFECT ON US
LIBRARIES DISCUSSED. ISRAELI CATALOGUING HAS TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWED US
PRACTICE, AND ISRAELI LIBRARIES WILL ADOPT AACR2 SOONER OR LATER TO AVAIL
THEMSELVES OF FOREIGN CATALOGUING AND TO ENABLE ISRAELI CATALOGUING TO BECOME
PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. Y ET, IT IS NOT
IMPERATIVE TO ADOPT AACR2 IMMEDIATELY. IT IS DESIRABLE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW US
LIBRARIES ACCUSTOM THEMSELVES TO THE CHANGES AND TO SEE HOW LC IMPLEMENTS AND
INTERPRETS THE RULES. MEANWHILE IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ALL OPTIONS IN AACR2 BE
CHECKED, AND A UNIFORM ISRAELI PRACTICE BE ADOPTED. IT IS ALSO DESIRABLE THAT
THE FEASIBILITY OF ADOPTING AACR2 AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION BY
2KIRYATH SEPHER1, THE ISRAEL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, BE CHECKED.
OLD BOOKS' NEW RULES.
     
AN EXAMINATION OF THE ADDITIONAL RULES IN AACR2 FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF EARLY
PRINTED MONOGRAPHS, CONCLUDING THAT PRE-1821 IMPRINTS ARE AMENABLE TO THE
GENERAL RULES, THAT THEY DO NOT REQUIRE ANY MORE ELABORATE DESCRIPTION THAN
LATER BOOKS AND THAT THE PROVISION OF EXTRA BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IS OF
DOUBTFUL UTILITY, EVEN WHERE THE NECESSARY EXPERTISE EXISTS TO PROVIDE IT.
MAINSTREAMING MEDIA CENTER MATERIALS' ADOPTING AACR2.
     
PRESENTS THE CASE FOR THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE ADOPTING AACR2 FOR THE
CATALOGUING OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS.

THE UNION CATALOGUE OF NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA IN NEW PREMISES' REPORTS FOR
1977-80.
     
THE UNION CATALOGUE IS PRODUCED IN COLOGNE BY THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY CENTRE
FOR NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA AND COVERS 25,600,000 VOLUMES FROM 135 LIBRARIES.
THERE IS A BASIC CENTRAL CATALOGUE ON CARDS AND MICROFICHE VERSIONS FOR
EXTERNAL USE ARE BEING PRODUCED. INITIAL PROBLEMS ARISING FROM NEW LEGAL
REGULATIONS ON LOANS HAVE NOW BEEN OVERCOME AND THE ORDERING PROCESS HAS BEEN
SIMPLIFIED. THE INTER-LIBRARY LOAN SYSTEM HAS BEEN EXPANDED AND A NEW
AGREEMENT MADE WITH THE BRITISH LIBRARY CONCERNING LOANS OF GERMAN AND ENGLISH
MATERIAL. AN ATTEMPT MADE TO USE TELEX FOR INTER-LIBRARY LOANS PROVED TOO
EXPENSIVE. WORK HAS BEGUN ON AN ISBN INDEX MADE BY ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
THE ROLE OF THE EXTERNAL CENTRES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT.
ON COSTING ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS FOR COM-FICHE CATALOGUES.
     
AN ALGEBRAIC MODEL RELATING CATALOGUE COSTS TO THE NUMBER OF EXISTING TITLES,
NEW TITLES AND TITLES PROCESSED IS DEVELOPED. THE NUMBER OF TITLES PROCESSED
IS THEN RELATED TO THE CUMULATION AND CONSOLIDATION FREQUENCIES SO THAT THE
EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CUMULATION PATTERNS CAN BE CALCULATED. THIS SHOWS THAT
ANNUAL CONSOLIDATION IS SENSIBLE IN SEVERAL SITUATIONS. VARIATIONS IN OTHER
FACTORS ARE NOT CONSIDERED EXPLICITLY BUT A COMPUTER SIMULATION MODEL IS
DESCRIBED WHICH COULD BE USED TO INVESTIGATE ANY SET OF REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVES.
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON UNION LIST OF SERIALS.
     
DESCRIBES THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT THE UNION LIST OF SERIALS
PROJECT-THE EFFECT ON COLLECTIONS OF INCREASINGLY INADEQUATE FUNDS AND THE
NEED FOR THE RATIONALISATION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S SERIALS HOLDINGS. THE
OBJECTIVES OF THE SCHEME ARE OUTLINED, THEN THE PLANNING AND SYSTEMS DESIGN,
WHICH TOOK PLACE IN 1974-75, ARE TRACED. WITH PLANNING COMPLETE, THE STRUCTURE
AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE DESCRIBED, FOLLOWED BY A DESCRIPTION
OF INPUT TO THE FILE. FINALLY FUTURE PLANS ARE OUTLINED.
CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN THE 1980S' IFLA'S ROLE.
     
BASED ON AN INTRODUCTORY PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST OPEN MEETING OF THE IFLA
SECTION ON CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT CATALOGUING, AT THE IFLA ANNUAL
CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG, EAST GERMANY, AUG 81. OUTLINES TRENDS WHICH HAVE RESULTED
IN CHANGES IN THE ROLE OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDEXING IN THE LAST
DECADE' LESS TIME FOR CLASSIFICATION AND INDEXING; INCREASED INTEREST IN
GENERAL CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES AND SUBJECT INDEXING SYSTEMS; MORE CENTRALISED
OR SHARED PROCESSING; AND INCREASED INTEREST IN RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. DESCRIBES
THE SETTING UP OF THE NEW IFLA SECTION ON CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT
CATALOGUING, ITS TERMS OF REFERENCE AND ITS MEDIUM TERM PROGRAMME.
REGARDING CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE SCIENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATIONS.
     
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE CLASSIFICATIONS AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CLASSIFICATIONS HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER OF
KNOWLEDGE AND THE UNI-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION.
SEMANTIC CATALOGUES EXIST IN A LOGICAL STATE OF PROBABILITY NOT ONLY BECAUSE
OF THE TEMPORAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR PREPARATION AND CONSULTATION, BUT
BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER BE VERIFIED, EXCEPT AFTER A GREAT TIME LAG. THE PROBLEM
IS ALWAYS THE SEARCH FOR FORMULAE FOR REFERENCES PROVIDING THE GREATEST
GUARANTEE OF INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN SUBJECTS. THERE IS A VITAL NEED TO
DEFINE THEORETICALLY AND LOGICALLY THE 'SUBJECT' IN RELATION TO THE 'OBJECT'.
APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET CLASSIFICATION SCHEME IN BULGARIA'S SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES.
     
SINCE 1970, WORK HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS TO GRADUALLY INTRODUCE THE SOVIET
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME (REFERRED TO AS BBK) INTO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES IN
BULGARIA. THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACHIEVING THIS TARGET HAS BEEN THAT OF
THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL
COMMITTEE FOR CULTURE AND OTHER BODIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S STAFF HAVE BEEN
PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED IN TRANSLATING AND EDITING THE UNABRIDGED
30-VOLUME-BBK-VERSION WHICH HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FROM 1973-81. THE LARGE
SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES WILL BE CATERED FOR WITH THIS EDITION. PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARIES IN SCHOOLS AND OTHERS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH ABRIDGED VERSIONS
ADAPTED FOR THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS. VARIOUS GUIDE BOOKS, EITHER TRANSLATED FROM
RUSSIAN OR WRITTEN BY BULGARIAN EXPERTS, WILL ASSIST LIBRARIANS TO APPLY THE
BBK IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. AN ITEMISED ACCOUNT FOR INTRODUCING THE BBK IS
GIVEN; IT IS EMPHASISED, IN PARTICULAR, THAT THE BBK IS THE ONLY
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON MARXISM-LENINISM.
SOME THOUGHTS ON THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE BASIC CONFLICT IN ALL CLASSIFICATION
NAMELY THE NEED FOR STABILITY ON ONE HAND AND FOR DEVELOPMENT ON THE OTHER.
URGES THAT THERE BE A SINGLE, CURRENT EDITION OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION AT LONGER INTERVALS TOGETHER WITH A CONTROLLED PROGRAMME OF
OFFICIALLY SPONSORED PILOT SCHEDULES FOR PRIORITY DISCIPLINARY REVISIONS.

REVISING THE DEWEY MUSIC SCHEDULES' TRADITION VS. INNOVATION.
     
PRESENTS A STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF THE MUSIC SCHEDULES OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL
CLASSIFICATION AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S PROPOSAL FOR A TOTAL REVISION OF
THESE SCHEDULES. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE ABILITY OF EACH CLASSIFICATION
TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARY PATRONS USING THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT TO RETRIEVE
SCORES FOR PERFORMANCE PURPOSES. THE BASIS OF THE COMPARISON PRESENTED HERE IS
A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 400 CHAMBER-MUSIC SCORES CHOSEN FROM THE 2BRITISH CATALOGUE
OF MUSIC1. EACH CLASSIFICATION IS ANALYSED FOR ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN
TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PERFORMERS, AND THE CLASSIFICATIONS
ARE THEN COMPARED USING STANDARD STATISTICAL METHODS. CONCLUDES WITH A
DISCUSSION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S PROPOSAL IS A PROPER
VEHICLE FOR A PHOENIX TREATMENT OF DDC 780 AND SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF
INCLUDING IT IN SOME FUTURE EDITION OF DDC.
LC CLASSIFICATION KEY' A COMPARISON OF CLASSES Q-V WITH THEIR Z COUNTERPARTS.
     
THE KEY RELATES THE MAIN CLASSES AND SUBCLASSES OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
SYSTEM FOR Q THROUGH V TO THEIR CORRESPONDING Z NUMBERS (THE Z SECTIONS DEALS
MOSTLY WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIES). IT IS A CONTINUATION OF THE KEY TO CLASSES A
THROUGH P WHICH APPEARED IN +R+Q 21 (1) FALL 81, 72-80.
UDC/CCC MEDIUM TERM PROGRAMME' THE MOSCOW MEETING-A MILESTONE.
     
DISCUSSES THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR
DOCUMENTATION/UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION'S CENTRAL CLASSIFICATION
COMMITTEE (FID/CCC) MEETING, MOSCOW, 25-27 SEPT 79, TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
FID/CCC MEDIUM TERM PROGRAMME RELATED TO ITS TASKS FOR THE MAINTENANCE,
REVISION, PROMOTION, AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF UDC IN 1981-84. REGARDS THE
FID/CCC PROJECTS AS A MILESTONE FOR THE PROGRAMME. THESE PROJECTS ARE DIVIDED
INTO 3 GROUPS' THOSE OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO THE FID SECRETARIAT AND FID/CCC;
THOSE OF PRIMARY INTEREST TO FID/CCC; AND THOSE OF THE UDC REVISION
COMMITTEES.
AUSTRALIA, LCSH AND FLASH.
     
DESCRIBES THE 1ST EDITION OF THE 2LIST OF AUSTRALIAN SUBJECT HEADINGS1, AND
SETS IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE HISTORY OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN AUSTRALIA AND
OF THE ORIGINS OF LCSH. THE REASONS LCSH NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED FOR AUSTRALIAN
USE ARE DESCRIBED, AND SOME FUTURE POSSIBILITIES FOR SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN
AUSTRALIA, AND FOR LCSH, ARE SUGGESTED.
A MATHEMATICAL APPROACH TO RELATIONS IN THESAURI.
     
PRESENTS A BRIEF BACKGROUND OF SET THEORY AND RELATIONS INCLUDING EQUIVALENCE
AND ORDERING RELATIONS. PROPOSES 4 WORKING HYPOTHESES CONCERNED WITH THESAURI
RELATIONS. EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF GENERATING AN EQUIVALENCE CLASS OF
DESCRIPTORS FROM A SINGLE DESCRIPTOR TO AID INFORMATION/DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL.
PROVIDES A NEW MATHEMATICAL APPROACH TO A THESAURUS AND ITS RELATIONS AND
COMPARES IT AGAINST THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF REPRESENTING A THESAURUS. PROPOSES
NEW AREAS FOR INVESTIGATION IN THIS DIRECTION.
PROBLEM RUBRICATOR ON MEDICAL IMMUNOLOGY.
     
RUBRICATOR (A TYPE OF MACROCLASSIFICATION SYSTEM) ON MEDICAL IMMUNOLOGY,
DEVELOPED ON THE BASIS OF THE MEDICINE AND HEALTH SERVICES RUBRICATOR, IS
ANALYSED. RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTAL INDEXING OF DOCUMENTS ON SPECIFIC SUBJECTS
WITHIN THE GIVEN SUBJECT FIELD CONFIRM THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS USE IN AN
AUTOMATED IR SYSTEM BOTH ON ITS OWN AND IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER NARROW
SUBJECT FIELD SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE ALSO SHOWN THE FEASIBILITY OF EXPANDING THE
SCHEDULES FOR OTHER NARROW DISCIPLINES COVERED BY THE MEDICINE AND HEALTH
SERVICES RUBRICATOR.
AUTOMATION OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK STATEWIDE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM.
     
THE CZECHOSLOVAK SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS AUTOMATED IN
1972, AND INCLUDES THE PROCESSING OF SEVERAL DATA BASES, INTERBRANCH
INFORMATION STOCKS, AND FACTOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. THE IDEA
OF COMPUTERISATION COMBINES THE PRINCIPLES OF CENTRALISATION AND
DECENTRALISATION OF INFORMATION PROCESSES ON THE BASIS OF STANDARDISATION OF
METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. FURTHER
AUTOMATION WILL COVER STATEWIDE TELENETS, TERMINAL DEVICE AND MINICOMPUTERS,
THE CREATION OF SOME ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES OF RETRO TYPE, AND
THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS WITH
DEPARTMENTAL AUTOMATED CONTROL SYSTEMS.
AN ASSOCIATIVE SEARCH STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
EXTENDS GOFFMAN'S INDIRECT METHOD OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BY SUGGESTING A
MORE FLEXIBLE SEARCH STRATEGY. QUERIES CAN BE CLASSIFIED BY 2 CRITERIA' THE
KIND OF ANSWER EXPECTED AND THE WAY THE QUERY IS DEFINED. CONSIDERS THE
INDIRECT METHOD AND CLEVELAND'S GEOMETRICAL MODEL. DISCUSSES THE PROPOSED
CHAINING PROCESS AND SEARCH STRATEGY. IN ITS SIMPLEST VERSION, THIS STRATEGY
CAN REPLACE BOOLEAN SYSTEMS, ACHIEVING MUCH GREATER EFFECTIVENESS WITH
COMPARABLE COSTS.

WRITTEN FOR BEGINNERS IN THE AUTOMATED RETRIEVAL OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE,
CONSIDERS SOURCES AND METHODS OF SEARCHES AND THE EVALUATION OF RESULTS AND
EXPLAINS HOW THE COMPUTER CARRIES OUT THE SEARCH.
STUDY OF ONLINE USE IN FINLAND.
     
THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECTION OF THE COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
(TINFO) SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO 286 LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION UNITS TO FIND
OUT ABOUT THEIR ON-LINE USE. 83 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED. OUT OF THESE 55
WERE ON-LINE USERS AND 14 WERE PLANNING TO SEARCH ON-LINE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
ABOUT 150 INFORMATION SCIENTISTS ARE INVOLVED IN ON-LINE SEARCHES.91.7% OF THE
SEARCHES WERE CARRIED OUT BY INFORMATION SCIENTISTS WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF
THE CLIENT. IN 1980 ABOUT 10,000 SEARCHES WERE MADE. 100 WAS THE MOST TYPICAL
ANNUAL NUMBER PER UNIT. TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER COSTS WERE ABOUT 2.1
MILLION FINNISH MARKS IN 1980. MORE THAN &H OF THE CONNECT TIME WAS USED WITH
AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEMS, 39% WITH SCANDINAVIAN AND 10% WITH OTHER
EUROPEAN. SINCE THE SURVEY OF 1978, THE NUMBER OF ON-LINE USERS HAS INCREASED
BY 90%.
FANTASTIC POSSIBILITIES FOR GLOBAL INFORMATION TO THE SMALLEST VILLAGE.
     
REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION, ORGANISED BY THE BRITISH
LIBRARY AND HELD IN SEPT 81, WITH THE AIM OF EXAMINING RECENT EXPERIMENTS WITH
ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SEEING THEM IN ACTION, AND
DISCUSSING RELATED ASPECTS SUCH AS FEES. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS
OF INFORMATION' FACTS; AND INFORMATION ABOUT INFORMATION, SUCH AS PARTICULAR
BOOKS OR SUBJECTS. TO HANDLE THE STREAM OF INFORMATION, LIBRARIES NEED NEW
TECHNOLOGY. ONLY IF INFORMATION IS ELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED CAN ALL
INFORMATION BE ACCESSIBLE ON-LINE TO EVERYONE. PROBLEMS THEN ARISE OF ACTUALLY
OBTAINING THE INFORMATION AND SELECTING THE AMOUNT NEEDED. STANDARDISATION OF
CATALOGUING AND SYSTEMS IS NEEDED. THE HOLDINGS OF DANISH LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
ELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON-LINE
TO GROUPS WITHIN POLITICS, BUSINESS, AND EDUCATION AND TO INDIVIDUALS. THE
BIROS EXPERIMENT IN ENGLAND SHOWS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN HANDLE THIS TASK.
THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE THE POINT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN ALL
LIBRARIES.
ONLINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY' THE BRITISH LIBRARY
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY AT AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE.
     
REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES
HELD IN BANBURY, 8-10 SEPT 81. THE BRITISH LIBRARY DEVOTES *6150,000 OF ITS
ANNUAL BUDGET TO RESEARCH INTO ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIANSHIP. SINCE 1978 THE
BRITISH LIBRARY HAS SPONSORED A NUMBER OF PROJECTS CONCERNED WITH ON-LINE
INFORMATION SERVICES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE BIROS AND 'GUIDELINES'
PROJECTS. THE BIROS (BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ONLINE SERVICE)
PROJECT INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT BY STAFF OF MANCHESTER POLYTECHNIC OF AN
ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR USE IN LANCASHIRE COUNTY LIBRARY,
WHILST THE 'GUIDELINES' PROJECT STUDIED THE USE OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE RESULTS OF THE 'GUIDELINES' PROJECT SHOWED THAT THESE SERVICES
WERE USED LARGELY BY BUSINESSMEN AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY TEACHERS. THE
PROJECT WAS UNABLE TO PROVID E A SOLUTION TO THE QUESTION OF CHARGING FOR SUCH
SERVICES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES THE BACKGROUND AND ACTIVITIES OF THE DANISH DIANE CENTRE, OPENED IN
JUNE 81. THE COMMISSION OF THE EEC HAD IN 1972 DECIDED TO SET UP A EUROPEAN
DATA TRANSMISSION NETWORK, EURONET, OPERATED BY THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION
SERVICES, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A EUROPEAN INFORMATION INDUSTRY IN THE FACE OF
US COMPETITION. THE 36 HOSTS, ORGANISATIONS AND PRIVATE SERVICE BUREAUX, WHICH
OFFER ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF 271 DIFFERENT DATA BASES AND DATA
BANKS, ARE GATHERED UNDER THE NETWORK DIANE. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN DATA BASES,
USUALLY STORING BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA, AND DATA BANKS, MOSTLY WITH INSTANTLY
USABLE DATA. FULL TEXT BASES AND REGISTERS OF ACTIVITIES AND ADDRESSES ARE
ALSO GAINING IN IMPORTANCE. TO SPREAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF EURONET-DIANE'S
INFORMATION SERVICES, ADVISORY CENTRES ARE SET UP IN THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES,
VIZ. THE DANISH DIANE CENTRE. THE CENTRE HOPES TO ADVISE ON ALL DATA BASES AND
DATA BANKS WH ICH CAN BE USED IN DENMARK, INCLUDING US, EUROPEAN AND
SCANDINAVIAN NETWORKS. THE CENTRE AIMS TO ADVISE ON THE OPTIMAL USE OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION SERVICES THROUGH DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS, COURSES AND
PUBLICATIONS.
THIS IS WHY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS PARTICIPATING IN THE TELEDATA
EXPERIMENT.
     
EXPLAINS THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (DANMARKS
BIBLIOTEKSFORENING (DB)) IN THE DANISH TELEADMINISTRATION'S PLANNED TELEDATA
EXPERIMENT, DUE TO RUN FOR 2 YEARS FROM JAN 82. 200 TV SETS WILL BE PLACED
WITH SELECTED USERS, 25 OF WHOM WILL BE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND 10 OF THESE
LIBRARIES. ABOUT 60 ORGANISATIONS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION AND DB WILL
COORDINATE THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED TO THE TELEDATA BASE. DB WAS ABLE TO ARGUE
SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST FEES FOR THE USE OF THE TELEDATA DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL
PERIOD. BY BEING INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FROM
THE START, DB IS BETTER ABLE TO INFLUENCE IT. THIS ALSO EXPLAINS WHY DB IS A
MEMBER OF DANMEDIA, HAS HELPED TO SET UP A TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE AND IS
REPRESENTED IN THE MEDIA COMMISSION. A PROJECT AIMED AT EVALUATION OF THE
TELEDATA MEDIUM FROM A LIBRARY VIEWPOINT IS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE LIBRARY
INSPECTORATE AND D B. INCLUDES A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ARTICLES ON INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHED IN 2BOGENS VERDEN1 SINCE 1979.
PRESTEL IN USE' A CONSUMER VIEW.
     
DESCRIBES 2 TESTS ON PRESTEL. TEST 1 EXPLORES THE ADEQUACY OF THE DATA BASE IN
GIVING SATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM ORDINARY CONSUMERS. TEST 2
SCREENS PRESTEL'S INDEX DESIGN AND DATA BASE CRITERIA AGAINST CRITERIA FROM
THE LITERATURE OF CONSUMER ECONOMICS, CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR AND CONSUMER
INFORMATION SYSTEMS. MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING' THE INDEX; OPTIMAL MEANS
OF ACCESS; COSTS AND THEIR REGISTRATION; INCREASES IN INFORMATION AND
SERVICES; AND THE QUALITY OF THE FILES.
LASER AND PRESTEL.
     
LASER (LONDON AND SOUTH EASTERN LIBRARY REGION) IS CARRYING OUT RESEARCH ON
THE USE OF PRESTEL IN UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES FUNDED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, AND IN COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
INDUSTRY AND BRITISH TELECOM. EVALUATES THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL
PLACING OF PRESTEL SETS IN LIBRARIES AND DISCUSSES HOW LASER MAY ACT AS AN
UMBRELLA FOR THE INPUT OF COMMUNITY INFORMATION, DESIGNING AND INDEXING A
SUITABLE DATA BANK STRUCTURE. OUTLINES THE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE SOCIAL
INFORMATION PROVIDERS GROUP.
A YEAR'S EXPERIENCE WITH VIEWDATA IN DUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN AUG 80 60 PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE NETHERLANDS BEGAN A 12-MONTH
INVESTIGATION OF THE POSSIBLE USES OF VIEWDATA IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION ARE CURRENTLY BEING STUDIED BY A WORKING PARTY
SET UP BY THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR
LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE). THE CURRENT COST OF THE SYSTEM VARIES FROM *6700 TO
*62,000 DEPENDING ON THE EQUIPMENT CHOSEN, PLUS THE COST OF TELEPHONE CHARGES,
SUBSCRIPTION TO VIEWDATA (*62 PER MONTH) AND THE COST OF COMPUTER TIME. AT
PRESENT VIEWDATA APPEARS TO HAVE LITTLE USE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, THE
EXPERIMENT HAS PROVED VALUABLE IN ACQUAINTING LIBRARY STAFF AND READERS WITH
THE OPERATION OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
IS IT MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TO PRINT ON- OR OFFLINE?.
     
QUESTIONS THE TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE TO PRINT SEARCH
RESULTS OFF-LINE THAN TO PRINT THEM ON-LINE. DESCRIBES A SIMPLE FORMULA TO
DETERMINE ON-LINE PRINT COSTS FOR COMPARISON WITH OFF-LINE CHARGES FOR 2 MAJOR
DATA BASE VENDORS (LOCKHEED AND SDC). THE EQUATION PERMITS THE CALCULATION OF
THE MAXIMUM CITATION LENGTH AT WHICH OFF-LINE PRINTING BECOMES ECONOMIC.
CONCLUDES THAT WITH LOCAL PRINTING AT 1200 BAUD, THERE IS VERY LITTLE
ADVANTAGE TO PRINTING OFF-LINE.
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION IN THE DATABASE SEARCHING CONTEXT.
     
THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES OF ACADEMIC REFERENCE LIBRARIANS HAVE
UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS. 2 SPECIALISED AREAS OF
REFERENCE SERVICES, LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AND ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING HAVE
BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. EXPLORES WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARY INSTRUCTION
PROGRAMMES AND DATA BASE SEARCHING SERVICES CAN BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE AND
MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE.
ONLINE SEARCHING AND CHEMISTRY STUDENTS AT KNOX.
     
THE CAREFUL INTEGRATION OF ON-LINE SEARCHING OF THE CHEMICAL LITERATURE INTO
THE CURRICULUM AT KNOX COLLEGE LIBRARY, GALESBURG, ILLINOIS IS DESCRIBED.
FINNISH ONLINE DATABASES.
     
KATI DATA BASE CONTAINS ABOUT 50,000 REFERENCES TO FINNISH BOOKS AND
PERIODICAL ARTICLES. IT IS MEANT FOR GENERAL USE. IT COVERS 1977-79, BUT THE
ARTICLES' FILE SHOULD BE UP-TO-DATE FAIRLY SOON. HELSINKI SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
OFFERS 4 DATA BASES ON-LINE' FINP (FINNISH PERIODICALS INDEX IN ECONOMICS AND
BUSINESS FROM 1975), BILD (BIBLIOGRAPHIC INDEX OF LIBRARY DOCUMENTS FROM
1981), SCANP (SCANDINAVIAN PERIODICALS INDEX IN ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS SINCE
1977), AND SCIMP (EUROPEAN INDEX OF MANAGEMENT PERIODICALS SINCE 1978). MEDIC
IS A FINNISH MEDICAL DATA BASE WHICH COVERS ARTICLES AND MONOGRAPHS PUBLISHED
IN FINLAND SINCE 1978. SFS CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT FINNISH STANDARDS AND
TECHNICAL RULES AND REGULATIONS. TENTTU CONTAINS TECHNICAL MONOGRAPHS FROM THE
MAIN CATALOGUE OF THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SINCE 1980. TALI CONTAINS
FINNISH LANGUAGE TECHNICAL JOURNAL ARTICLES.
A COMPARISON OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS AND NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL
HEALTH DATABASES.
     
A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE COVERAGE AND FEATURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
ABSTRACTS AND NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH) ON-LINE DATA BASES.
THE FOLLOWING AREAS WERE COMPARED: CITATION OVERLAP, JOURNAL COVERAGE,
DESCRIPTIVE INDEXING, TREATMENT OF IDENTICAL RECORDS, AND SUBJECT COVERAGE.
RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A 49.0% CITATION OVERLAP BETWEEN NIMH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
ABSTRACTS AND INDICATE A COMPLEMENTARY, NOT COMPETITIVE, RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE FILES.
COMPUTER SEARCHING' A RESOURCE FOR WOMEN'S EDUCATIONAL EQUITY.
     
DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN WOMEN'S CONCERNS MAKE USE OF
COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SOURCES, THIS GUIDE DEFINES THE NATURE OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, EXPLAINS HOW THOSE SYSTEMS ARE ACCESSED, ILLUSTRATES A
TYPICAL COMPUTER SEARCH STRATEGY, DISCUSSES THE COSTS OF ON-LINE SEARCHING,
AND DESCRIBES THE WOMEN'S EDUCATIONAL EQUITY COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK (WEECN)
COMPUTERISED DATA BASE. APPENDICES PROVIDE A LIST OF SOME ON-LINE SOCIAL
SCIENCE DATA BASES THAT CONTAIN INFORMATION ON WOMEN'S ISSUES AS WELL AS A
SAMPLE PRINTOUT. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
AN AUTOMATIC METHOD FOR EXTRACTING SIGNIFICANT PHRASES IN SCIENTIFIC OR
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS.
     
THIS METHOD IS BASED ON TEXT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS AND USES A RELATIVELY SMALL
DICTIONARY. THE DICTIONARY IS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL CONCEPTS AND ON SOME LEXICAL KNOWLEDGE. TEXT ANALYSIS IS USED TO
SELECT SIGNIFICANT PHRASES AS SUBSTANTIAL AND SEMANTIC INFORMATION CARRIERS OF
THE CONTENTS OF THE ABSTRACT. RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT ON 5 SETS OF DOCUMENTS
INDICATE THAT SIGNIFICANT PHRASES ARE EFFECTIVELY EXTRACTED WITHIN A
SATISFACTORY PROCESSING TIME.
NORMALIZATION OF TITLES AND THEIR RETRIEVAL.
     
THE TITLE EXPRESSED BY A NOUN PHRASE OR CLAUSE IS CONVERTED TO A
FUNCTION-EXPRESSION BY PARSING. FOR RETRIEVAL WITH A REASONABLE RECALL RATE AS
WELL AS A HIGH PRECISION RATE, THE FUNCTION-EXPRESSION IS TRANSFORMED TO A
PREDICATE-GOVERNOR FORM AND THEN NORMALISED TO A STANDARD FORM. VARIOUS ITEMS
ARE TAKEN FROM THIS AND RECORDED IN A HIERARCHICAL, TREE-LIKE INVERTED FILE.
TO KEEP RECALL AT A REASONABLE RATE, SEVERAL RETRIEVAL STAGES ARE IMPLEMENTED
BASED ON THE KEY-TERM AND CASE-LABEL MATCHING. RETRIEVAL IS CONTROLLED BY THE
PRECISENESS OF THE SPECIFICATION OF CASE-LABELS FOR EACH KEY-TERM.
THE 'IMMEDIATE CONCERN AREA' FROM THE USER'S POINT OF VIEW.
     
MULHEIM AN DER RUHR HAS HAD A TRIPARTITE LIBRARY SINCE 1977, TOTAL STOCKS OF
276,740 ITEMS SERVING A POPULATION OF 181,522. THE 'IMMEDIATE CONCERN AREA',
OR FOROTHEK, COMPRISES 9,100 UNCATALOGUED VOLUMES OF A POPULAR NATURE ARRANGED
INFORMALLY IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS, WITH SUCH FICTION CATEGORIES AS THRILLERS
AND SUCH NON-FICTION CATEGORIES AS BOOKS FOR PARENTS, BOOKS ON ANIMALS AND
CONSUMER INFORMATION. IN MAR 80 A SURVEY OF READERS' OPINIONS ON THE FOROTHEK
WAS CARRIED OUT; INFORMATION FROM 500 QUESTIONNAIRES IS ANALYSED IN DETAIL.
MOST PEOPLE LIKED THE FOROTHEK; IT HELPED MANY READERS TO USE THE MAIN LIBRARY
MORE EASILY AND TO DISCOVER FRESH INTERESTS.
THE NON-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT WITH A DEPARTMENT COMMON TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN IN THE
NEW LIBRARY IN EMMABODA, OPENED IN AUTUMN 80. THE SHAPE OF THE NEW LIBRARY
MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DIVIDE IT INTO DEPARTMENTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVINGS
IN ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN, OR FOR YOUNG
PEOPLE ON THE BORDERLINE OF ADULTHOOD PERSUADED THE LIBRARY TO TRY TO
INTEGRATE THE MATERIAL. THE LIBRARY IS DIVIDED INTO FICTION AND NON-FICTION,
WITH NON-FICTION BOOKS FOR CHILDREN PLACED AFTER THOSE FOR ADULTS ON THE SAME
SHELF; ADULT FICTION AND CHILDREN'S FICTION HAVE THEIR OWN SHELVES, BUT IN THE
SAME PLACE IN THE HALL. AN AREA IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUE DESK CONTAINS
PERIODICALS AND PICTURE BOOKS WITH SEATING FOR ALL AGES, INCLUDING HEADPHONES
FOR CHILDREN. AFTER A YEAR THE EXPERIENCE HAS PROVED ENTIRELY POSITIVE.
FREE ACCESS TO READING' A NEW POLICY OF OPPORTUNITIES.
     
CRITICISES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY POLICY OF DIVIDING CHILDREN'S BOOKS ACCORDING TO
AGE LEVEL AS CONTRARY TO THE READER'S RIGHT TO SELECT MATERIAL APPROPRIATE TO
HIS OWN ABILITIES. DRAWS ON RECENT STUDIES BY BRAZILIAN RESEARCHERS TO
ESTABLISH THAT FLUENCY IN READING IS A SKILL ACQUIRED PROGRESSIVELY AT AN
INDIVIDUAL RATE DETERMINED BOTH BY AN INCREASE IN MECHANICAL FACILITY AND THE
PROCESS OF MATURING. THUS THE READER'S AGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TO
HIS READING CAPACITY, AND ARTIFICIAL DIVISIONS IMPOSED BY LIBRARIES
EFFECTIVELY PREVENT ACCESS TO SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
ADVANTAGES OF PERMITTING FREE CHOICE OF BOOKS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO
POPULARISING LIBRARIES AND MAXIMISING USE OF THEIR RESOURCES.
THE INFORMATION SYSTEM IN YUGOSLAVIA.
     
(TRANSLATED BY DARINKA PETKOVIC AND MERIMA STEVANOVIC). CONCENTRATES ON THE
ROLE OF MASS MEDIA IN THE COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO YUGOSLAVIA.
MICROCOMPUTING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ELEMENT 3' POTENTIAL DEMAND, IMPACT AND
IMPLICATIONS OF MICROCOMPUTER APPLICATIONS.
     
REPORT OF A PROJECT COMMISSIONED BY THE JOINT DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND COMPUTER COMMITTEE (DOE/LAMSAC).
THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT WAS TO GAUGE THE POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR MICROCOMPUTER
APPLICATIONS (BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN PARTICULAR) AND TO REVIEW THEIR
IMPLICATIONS AND IMPACT.
PROBLEMS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER CENTER.
     
THE PERSONAL COMPUTER CENTER IS LOCATED IN THE CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY'S NORTH
PULASKI NEIGHBOURHOOD LIBRARY. FOCUSES ON THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED INCLUDING
STAFF TRAINING, STAFF TIME, COMPUTER PHOBIAS AND SECURITY.
CHOOSING AND USING A WORD PROCESSOR.
     
OUTLINES THE HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, BENEFITS, AND USES OF WORD PROCESSORS;
EXPLAINS THE EQUIPMENT; DESCRIBES THE CHOICE, INSTALLATION, AND USE OF WORD
PROCESSORS; AND OUTLINES METHODS OF FINANCE.
EDITEX' A TELEX TEXT-EDITOR BASED ON AN 8085 MICROPROCESSOR (IN DUTCH).
     
A MICROPROCESSOR-BASED TEXT EDITOR SPECIALLY DEVELOPED TO ADD TEXT EDITING
CAPABILITIES TO CURRENTLY USED TELEX MACHINES WITHOUT ANY NECESSARY TECHNICAL
CHANGES IS DESCRIBED.
REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEMS PLANNING FOR THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE.
     
POSTAL SERVICE STUDIES OF AN ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEM AND OF ELECTRONIC
COMPUTER-ORIGINATED MAIL ARE REVIEWED. AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW IT IS
CONCLUDED THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ELECTRONIC MAIL
SERVICES INSOFAR AS THEY ENHANCE PRESENT PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF MESSAGES.
ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICES SHOULD BE MANAGED BY AN INDEPENDENT UNIT WITHIN THE
POSTAL SERVICE, AND CONTINUED MARKET RESEARCH WILL BE NEEDED TO DETERMINE
CUSTOMER NEEDS. PLANNING FOR THE NEW SERVICES SHOULD BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP
WITH LABOUR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE SECURITY OF ELECTRONIC MAIL AGAINST
INSPECTION AND DISCLOSURE MUST BE ASSURED.
MODEMS, HERTZ AND BAUDS.
     
A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO THE BASICS OF MODERN OPERATION INCLUDING ACOUSTIC
COUPLERS AND DIRECT-CONNECT MODEMS.
MODEMS. 1964-JANUARY, 1982 (CITATIONS FROM THE NTIS DATA BASE).
     
THE DESIGN, SELECTION AND UTILISATION OF MODEMS ARE INVESTIGATED IN THE CITED
GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED RESEARCH REPORTS, WITH APPLICATIONS TO DATA TRANSMISSION,
LASER COMMUNICATIONS, VOICE COMMUNICATIONS, AND SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.
MODEMS. NOVEMBER, 1980-JANUARY, 1982 (CITATIONS FROM THE ENGINEERING INDEX
DATA BASE).
     
REPORTS FROM WORLDWIDE RESEARCH ARE CITED ON THE DESIGN, OPERATING PRINCIPLES,
AND APPLICATIONS OF MODEMS, WITH APPLICATIONS TO DATA TRANSMISSION, DIGITAL
VOICE COMMUNICATION, AND SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.
USING THE TEXT TELEPHONE-SOMETHING FOR LIBRARIES?.
     
DESCRIBES THE TEXT TELEPHONE INSTALLED IN LANDSKRONA PUBLIC LIBRARY EARLY IN
1981 FOR THE USE OF THE DEAF AND SPEECH IMPAIRED. IT CONSISTS OF 3 UNITS' AN
ORDINARY TELEPHONE, A KEYBOARD USED TO TYPE THE TEXT, AND A SCREEN MONITOR,
WHICH RECEIVES AND TRANSMITS THE TEXT. THE HANDICAPPED PERSON NEEDS ALSO A
SIGNAL RELAY, WHICH TRANSFORMS THE AUDIBLE TELEPHONE SIGNALS TO VISUAL
SIGNALS, AND HE MUST BE ABLE TO TYPE AS THE KEYBOARD IS THAT OF A STANDARD
TYPEWRITER. DISABLED PEOPLE CAN CONTACT OTHERS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT, BUT
CONTACT TO AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE REQUIRES A TRANSFORMER. THE TELEPHONE
DIRECTORY HAS SPECIAL MARKINGS FOR TEXT TELEPHONES. EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE,
WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW AND ISOLATED GROUPS, HAS BEEN
LIMITED BY LACK OF FINANCE.
READING AND SUCCESSFUL LIVING.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE SYMPOSIUM 'READING AND SUCCESSFUL LIVING' THE
FAMILY-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP', LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, CENTER FOR THE BOOK, NOV 81.
EXAMINES THE ROLE OF READING IN THE WIDEST SENSE OF PROVIDING ADULTS WITH A
MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD AND PROVIDING TOOL FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY
OF LIFE.
STUDIES OF THE BICULTURAL READER' IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS.
     
DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF STUDIES WHICH HAVE SHOWED THAT READERS UNDERSTAND AND
ENJOY THEIR READING MORE WHEN THEY SHARE AN AUTHOR'S CULTURAL BACKGROUND,
BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE WAY IN WHICH SHARED CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE (OR LACK
OF IT) CAN AFFECT READING COMPREHENSION IS DESCRIBED.
LITERATURE AND READING IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
     
STATISTICS FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS IN EAST GERMANY REFLECT THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED
BY THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IN STIMULATING PUBLIC INTEREST IN READING AND IN
TRYING TO SATISFY READERS' NEEDS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE RANGE OF MATERIAL ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IS
RECOGNISED. FOREIGN MATERIAL MOST IN DEMAND IS THAT FROM THE USSR, FOLLOWED BY
WORKS FROM OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND FROM THE THIRD WORLD. NATURALLY A
WIDE RANGE OF CONTEMPORARY DOMESTIC LITERATURE IS ALSO AVAILABLE. IN 1980,
LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 80 MILLION ITEMS AND THE BOOKTRADE TURNOVER HAS
INCREASED BY 32% DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS. CLOSE LINKS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
BETWEEN AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS AND THE PUBLIC. MORE RESEARCH INTO READING HABITS
AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH LITERATURE IS REQUIRED.
A VILLAGE WITH ONLY THREE BOOKS.
     
DISCUSSES A SHORT STORY BY A CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WRITER DEPICTING A
FICTITIOUS BRAZILIAN VILLAGE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WHERE ONLY 3 BOOKS ARE
AVAILABLE, CONTRASTING THE CULTURAL DEPRIVATION OF THE VILLAGERS WITH THE RICH
LITERARY EXPERIENCE OF CHARACTERS DEPICTED IN EUROPEAN FICTION. CONSIDERS THE
DISTORTED VIEW OF REALITY PRESENTED BY THE 3 BOOKS IN COMBINATION, AND
COMMENTS ON THIS INADEQUACY OF LITERARY PROVISION AS TYPICAL OF THE TIME.
A SOMEWHAT UNBUREAUCRATIC PROJECT.
     
DESCRIBES THE BACKGROUND TO A CAMPAIGN TO REACH MORE READERS WITH QUALITY
LITERATURE INITIATED BY THE CULTURAL COUNCIL. IN A MEMORANDUM OF FEB 81 IT WAS
DECIDED THAT THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD CONSIST OF 2 PROJECTS' A REGIONAL PROJECT, IN
WHICH NEW METHODS SHOULD BE USED TO STIMULATE INTEREST IN READING AND IMPROVE
THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE METHODS EVALUATED; AND A
NATIONAL INFORMATION CAMPAIGN WITH THE OBJECT OF GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT
BOOKS, AND STIMULATE INTEREST IN THE REGIONAL PROJECT. CONTACT WITH VARIOUS
ORGANISATIONS WAS MADE, ABOVE ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION. IN THE
REGIONAL PROJECT THE EMPHASIS WAS TO BE ON LOCAL INVOLVEMENT. THE PROJECT,
CALLED THE DALA PROJECT, IS TO START IN THE AUTUMN 81 IN THE KOPPARBERG REGION
AND HAS 4 CORNERSTONES' SCHOOLS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, STUDY CIRCLES AND MASS
MEDIA. THE PROJECT SHOULD LEAD TO COOPERATION AND BETTER USE OF RESOURCES, BUT
ALSO TO SUGGESTIONS FOR MODELS FOR FUTURE LOCAL LIBRARY  SERVICES AND FOR THE
OPINION FORMING ROLE OF THE CULTURAL COUNCIL.
AN EXAMINATION OF BOOK BUYERS AND LIBRARY USERS.
     
VERY FEW PEOPLE EITHER ONLY BUY THEIR BOOKS OR ONLY OBTAIN THEM FROM A LIBRARY
AND MANY PEOPLE BUY BOOKS AS OFTEN AS THEY BORROW THEM. LIBRARY USERS WHO
BORROW FEW BOOKS BUY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR BOOKS THAN LIBRARY USERS WHO
BORROW MANY BOOKS. HOWEVER, WHEREAS OVER 1/2 THE POPULATION OF GERMANY BUY
BOOKS, ONLY ABOUT 1/4 USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT
IMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON BEHAVIOUR REGARDING THE USE OF BOOKS INCLUDE THE HOME
BACKGROUND, SCHOOL AND GENERAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SENSE OF
VALUES ALSO PLAYS ITS PART, OFTEN INFLUENCED BY THE MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION
POSSIBILITIES. PERHAPS THE MAIN INFLUENCE IS THE SOCIAL LEARNING PROCESS AND
AN INDIVIDUAL'S OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT. THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS UNEXPLORED
POSSIBILITIES FOR INFLUENCING CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THEIR USE OF BOOKS.
WHAT DO CHILDREN KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN'S BOOKS?.
     
PRESENTS THE RESPONSES OF 8 CHILDREN, AGED BETWEEN 6 AND 11, TO QUESTIONS
ABOUT THEIR READING, DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THEIR PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES. THE
BOOKS CITED ARE MAINLY CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN WORKS. NO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
DETAILS ARE GIVEN.
CARRY OUT A READING CAMPAIGN IN YOUR CLASS.
     
A READING CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED OUT IN CLASS 3B OF ISLEV SCHOOL IN RODOVRE,
DENMARK, IN WHICH THE PUPILS AIMED TO READ AT HOME A TOTAL OF 200 BOOKS FROM
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN 9 WEEKS. THE READERS WERE GIVEN A TIME IN WHICH TO READ
EACH BOOK AND USED A FORM TO REPORT ON THE CONTENT, ILLUSTRATIONS AND EASE OF
READING. THESE COMMENTS WERE READ TO THE CLASS EACH WEEK. THE 1ST BATCH OF
BOOKS WAS CHOSEN BY THE 2 TEACHERS CONCERNED, THE NEXT BY TEACHERS AND PUPILS
TOGETHER IN THE LIBRARY, AND THE LAST MAINLY BY THE PUPILS THEMSELVES. IF NO
BOOK ATTRACTED A CHILD, HE OR SHE COULD CHOSE 1 FROM THE LIBRARY WITH HELP
FROM THE LIBRARIAN. A 'BOOK THERMOMETER' IN THE CLASSROOM SHOWED PROGRESS IN
READING THE 200 BOOKS. AN EXHIBITION ON THE PROJECT WAS MOUNTED IN THE LIBRARY
AND A TAPE WAS MADE OF SOME OF THE READERS' OPINIONS. THE CAMPAIGN STIMULATED
INTEREST IN READING AND IN BORROWING BOOKS FROM THE SCHOOL LIBRARY AND SOME
CHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER READ A BOOK BEFORE NOW DID SO, SOMETIMES AS A RESULT OF
THE RECORDED COMMENTS. THE AIM WAS FULFILLED, ALL 200 BOOKS BEING READ DURING
THE 9-WEEK PERIOD.
THE ROMANIZATION OF CYRILLIC SCRIPT.
     
IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL IS 2ND ONLY TO
ENGLISH LANGUAGE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL NO GENERALLY ACCEPTED
SCHEME IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR CONVERTING CYRILLIC CHARACTERS INTO ROMAN
SCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTION, BY WHICH CYRILLIC CHARACTERS ARE ROMANIZED INTO
PHONEMES, GIVES GOOD RESULTS FOR PRONUNCIATION BUT LEADS TO A NUMBER OF
ALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS, WHILST TRANSLITERATION, BY WHICH A SINGLE ROMAN
CHARACTER IS SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH CYRILLIC CHARACTER LEADS TO PRONUNCIATION
DIFFICULTIES. WITH THE GROWTH IN SCHEMES FOR CATALOGUE AUTOMATION IT IS
ESSENTIAL THAT A SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THIS PROBLEM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT
THE ISO STANDARD OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTION ALTHOUGH THIS HAS UNFORTUNATELY
FOUND LITTLE FAVOUR IN THE USA AND UK.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF BIBLIOGRAPHY IS
DIVIDED INTO 3 PERIODS' ORGANISATION AND FORMATION (END OF 19TH-BEGINNING OF
20TH CENTURY); FOUNDATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ORGANISATIONS AND THE CONDUCT OF
THE FIRST COOPERATED RESEARCH (1919-1939); AND WIDE COOPERATION AMONG
BIBLIOGRAPHERS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS
AND THE REALISATION OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROGRAMMES (FROM 1945). A
BRIEF ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN EACH PERIOD UP TO 1970S.
COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
A SCHEME FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN
BULGARIA HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS SINCE 1978 AND ALL MAJOR SCIENTIFIC AND CENTRAL
REGIONAL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME. 8
SERIES ARE PLANNED, INCLUDING A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CONTEMPORARY BULGARIAN
LITERATURE, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, DISSERTATIONS, GRAMOPHONE RECORDS, AND BULGARIAN PERIODICALS AND
ARTICLES IN DAILY PAPERS. THERE WILL ALSO BE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF FOREIGN
LITERATURE ON BULGARIA, TOGETHER WITH 1 OF BULGARIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE
FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION WILL RANGE FROM 1 WEEK, AS IN THE CASE OF CATALOGUE
CARDS, THROUGH BI-WEEKLY, MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY BULLETINS TO ANNUAL INDEXES OR
EVEN CUMULATIVE INDEXES PUBLISHED ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS. THE INTRODUCTION OF AN
APPROPRIATE SYSTEM, INCLUDING MINICOMPUTERS AND VIDEOTERMINI, MUST BE
ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF UPDATED NATIONAL STANDARDS ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DESCRIPTION, COMPILED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, ISBD(M)
AND ISBD(S).
REGIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, GREATER
ATTENTION HAS BEEN TURNED TO REGIONAL AND LOCAL PROBLEMS RECENTLY. MEMBERS OF
THE GOVERNING BODIES MUST THEREFORE BE KEPT ABREAST OF THE LATEST INFORMATION
ON THEIR REGIONS TO BE ABLE TO RUN THEIR ECONOMY SMOOTHLY AND TO PURSUE THE
CORRECT CULTURAL AND OTHER POLICIES. THUS DEPARTMENTS OF LOCAL HISTORY IN
LIBRARIES, AND THOSE IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE THE
DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD UP APPROPRIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES. IN
ADDITION TO BOOKS, DAILY PAPERS AND PERIODICALS, NON-BOOK MATERIALS SUCH AS
RECORDS, TAPES, DOCUMENTARY FILMS, SLIDES, PHOTOS AND PICTURE POSTCARDS HAVE
BECOME RATHER SIGNIFICANT. AS TO CONTENTS, MATERIALS HAVE TO BE SIFTED VERY
CAREFULLY TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS, EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENT
IN THE RELEVANT REGION.
THE CRISIS OF DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
ARGUES THAT, WHEREAS THE DANISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IS IN NO DANGER AS IT IS
SUBSIDISED THROUGH THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND ACQUIRED WIDELY BY ALL TYPES OF
LIBRARY, THE SELECTIVE, SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE GIVEN LOW PRIORITY. THE
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY HAS TRADITIONALLY FORMED THE BASIS OF COMPILATION OF
SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES, BUT WITH AUTOMATION IT IS LESS SUITABLE FOR SUBJECT
SEARCHES. GIVES EXAMPLES OF SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHOSE SELECTIONS ARE
NOT BASED ON THE EVALUATION OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION WITHIN
A SUBJECT. THE DANISH JOINT BIBLIOGRAPHIC COMMITTEE SET UP ON THE INSTIGATION
OF UNESCO LACKS INFLUENCE ON THE PRODUCTION OF SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
URGES THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION TO THE
ANALYTICAL, DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES AS THEY DO TO THE NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY.
PHOTOCOPYING EQUIPMENT).D
     
ISCUSSES SOME OF THE TRENDS IN THE PHOTOCOPIER MARKET, SUCH AS THE GROWTH IN
PLAIN PAPER COPIERS WITH FALLING PRICES ALONG WITH A REDUCTION IN SIZE AND
WEIGHT AND THE INCLUSION OF REFINEMENTS DUE TO SOLID STATE ELECTRONICS AND
FIBRE OPTICS. REVIEWS THE MAJOR PROCESSES USED (XEROGRAPHIC, ELECTROGRAPHIC,
THERMOGRAPHIC AND DIAZO) AND DEALS BRIEFLY WITH FACTORS GOVERNING THE DECISION
TO PURCHASE, RENT OR LEASE. FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A PHOTOCOPIER
ARE LISTED AND A GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THE FIELD IS GIVEN. A REPORT IS
PRESENTED ON SELF-SERVICE CONTROL DEVICES FOR PHOTOCOPIERS FOLLOWED BY TEST
REPORTS ON 15 PHOTOCOPIERS.
COPIES IN COPYRIGHT.
     
ARRANGED IN 3 SECTIONS: 'COPIES IN CONTINENTAL COPYRIGHT', BY J.H. SPOOR;
'COPIES IN UK COPYRIGHT', BY W.R. CORNISH AND 'COPIES IN US COPYRIGHT', BY
PETER F. NOLAN.
COPYRIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS.
     
EXAMINES SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WHICH ARE SEEN TO BE FACING THE PUBLISHING,
RECORD PRODUCTION, BROADCASTING, AND FILM MAKING INDUSTRIES IN THE UK BECAUSE
OF OUTDATED COPYRIGHT LAWS. DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE 1976 US COPYRIGHT LAW WHICH
DEALS WITH THE NEW AGE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS.
CONSIDERS SOME OF THE PROPOSALS OF THE WHITFORD COMMITTEE ON COPYRIGHT, AND
ARGUES THAT URGENT ACTION IS REQUIRED TO BRING IN A NEW COPYRIGHT STATUTE IN
THE UK BEFORE THE SITUATION DETERIORATES ANY FURTHER.
CHILDREN'S CULTURE IN DELHI.
     
DESCRIBES THE CHILDREN'S BOOK TRUST IN NEW DELHI, A PUBLISHING HOUSE FOR
CHILDREN, SET UP BY YAMUNA SHANKAR IN 1957 WITH THE AIM OF PRODUCING HIGH
QUALITY, LOW PRICED CHILDREN'S BOOKS. BOOKS ARE PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH, HINDI
AND 5 OTHER LANGUAGES; LOSSES ARE FINANCED BY OTHER PRINTING BUSINESS. THE
SUBJECTS ARE MOSTLY INDIAN MYTHOLOGY AND HISTORY, AND, RECENTLY, POPULAR
SCIENCE. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE' WRITERS' WORKSHOPS, A MAGAZINE 2CHILDREN'S
WORLD1, DRAWING COMPETITIONS FOR CHILDREN, FILM FESTIVALS, BOOK FAIRS, AND A
DOLLS' MUSEUM. THE TRUST ALSO RUNS A LIBRARY WITH TOYS, GAMES, AND 25,000
BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AGED 5-16. THE EFFORTS OF THE TRUST ARE PRAISEWORTHY, BUT
AMOUNT TO LITTLE IN A COUNTRY WHERE POVERTY AND ILLITERACY PREVAIL. MORE
UNORTHODOX MEDIA THAN THE WRITTEN WORD SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED.
THE INVOLVEMENT OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES IN THE BOOK INDUSTRY IN BRAZIL.
     
TRANSLATION FROM ENGLISH. MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN PROMINENT IN
BRAZIL IN ALL FIELDS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
CENTURY; THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLISHING BEGAN TO INCREASE NOTABLY WITH THE
EXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AT THE END OF THE 1950S. THE PROGRESSIVE STAGES
OF GROWTH UP TO THE PRESENT ARE DESCRIBED, WITH DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS WAYS IN
WHICH SUCH COMPANIES HAVE PENETRATED THE BOOK INDUSTRY AND PROTECTIVE
LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE NATIONAL COMPANIES. BRAZILIAN FIRMS ARE
MAINLY HAMPERED BY LACK OF CAPITAL; STRATEGIES USED TO CIRCUMVENT THIS PROBLEM
ARE DISCUSSED. THE MULTINATIONALS CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED IN BOOK PRODUCTION ARE
LISTED; MANY BRAZILIANS, HOWEVER, ARE INVOLVED IN THESE COMPANIES, WHILE SOME
MULTINATIONALS ARE COVERTLY INVOLVED IN NATIONAL COMPANIES. HENCE THE DIVISION
OF THE MARKET BETWEEN FOREIGN AND NATIONAL PRODUCERS IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE
EXACTLY.
PUBLISHERS AND WORD PROCESSORS.
     
DISCUSSES A RECENT PIRA SEMINAR ON THE USE OF WORD PROCESSING IN PUBLISHING,
REDUCING TYPESETTING COSTS BY LINKING EDITORIAL AND COMPOSING OPERATIONS.
INCLUDES US CASE STUDIES; UK PUBLISHERS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO ADOPT THE NEW
SYSTEMS. DESCRIBES HARDWARE AVAILABLE AND PROBLEMS OF COMPATABILITY. SOON
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE IN THE UK TO CHOOSE FROM.
THE ELECTRONIC NEWSPAPER-A REALITY ALREADY?.
     
BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE REPORT BY INTERNATIONAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT INC. THE
OUTLOOK FOR ELECTRONIC NEWSPAPER. PREDICTS THAT DURING THE 1980S THE MARKET
FOR ELECTRONIC NEWSPAPER SERVICES WILL GROW TO MORE THAN $500 MILLION, DIVIDED
EVENLY BETWEEN CONSUMER-ORIENTED AND BUSINESS-ORIENTED SERVICES, BUT THAT NEWS
SERVICES WILL BE USED BY ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL % OF THE POPULATION-GENERALLY
THOSE WHO HAVE VIDEOTEX EQUIPMENT OR HOME COMPUTERS; OVER 90% WILL CONTINUE
WITH NEWSPAPERS. DESCRIBES TYPES OF NEWS SERVICES THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE.
JAPANESE NEWSPAPERS AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.
     
THE JAPANESE ATTITUDE TO NEWSPAPERS AND NEW ELECTRONIC MEDIA IS DISCUSSED. THE
JAPANESE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN A HEALTHY STATE. HOWEVER
THERE ARE CLOSED LINKS BETWEEN NEWSPAPERS, TELEVISION AND RADIO, IN SPITE OF
LEGISLATION DISCOURAGING THIS, BECAUSE NEWSPAPER MANAGERS SEE A THREAT AND AN
OPPORTUNITY IN THE NEW MEDIA. THE NEW MEDIA PARTICULARLY MENTIONED ARE
TELETEXT, VIDEOTEX AND VIDEO TAPES AND VIDEO DISCS.
BOOKS AND THE HANDICAPPED CHILD.
     
THE CHILD WITH A HANDICAP IS OFTEN FURTHER HANDICAPPED BY THE LACK OF READING
MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR HIS PARTICULAR NEED. DESCRIBES MAJOR TYPES OF HANDICAP,
THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND THE REQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF BOOKS TO
MEET THESE NEEDS. DETAILS OF SUITABLE BOOKS FOR THE HANDICAPPED CHILD AND
BOOKS ABOUT HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ARE INCLUDED.
VIEWPOINT' CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BRAZIL. THE WRITER.
     
A POPULAR BRAZILIAN CHILDREN'S WRITER DISCUSSES STORYTELLING, DESCRIBING THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FICTION AND NON-FICTION, SOURCES OF MATERIAL, THE
GRATIFICATION OF PRAISE FROM READERS, AND THE ANNOYANCES WHICH THE MECHANICS
OF PUBLISHING CAN CAUSE.
CRISIS IN WONDERLAND' THE DILEMMA FACING PUBLISHERS OF CHILDREN'S FICTION.
     
DISCUSSES THE DIFFICULTIES CURRENTLY FACED BY UK PUBLISHERS OF CHILDRENS BOOKS
IN MAKING ECONOMIC SENSE OF PUBLISHING SERIOUS FICTION, IN PARTICULAR NEW
WRITERS OF SERIOUS FICTION. IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE FACTORS WHICH HAVE REDUCED
THE VIABILITY OF PUBLISHING CHILDREN'S FICTION-INCLUDING THE CUTS IN SCHOOL
AND LIBRARY SPENDING, AND THE INCREASING COSTS OF PRINTING AND BINDING.
BOOK PRESENTATION. AN ENQUIRY INTO FRENCH SCHOOLCHILDREN'S PREFERENCES IN
LAYOUT AND TYPOGRAPHY.
     
DESCRIBES A PROJECT TO DETERMINE CHILDREN'S ATTITUDES TO THE PHYSICAL
QUALITIES OF BOOKS. OVER 200 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY CHILDREN AFTER
EXAMINING 75 BOOKS OF ALL TYPES. USING THIS AS A BASIS, A SERIES OF GROUP
DISCUSSIONS WAS CONDUCTED TO GIVE A MORE DETAILED PICTURE. THE RESULTS,
RELATING TO BOTH LITERARY AND INTELLECTUAL CONTENT, AND PHYSICAL
CHARACTERISTICS, ARE PRESENTED GRAPHICALLY. IT WAS FOUND THAT CHOICE WAS
INFLUENCED MORE BY AESTHETIC THAN BY LITERARY CONSIDERATIONS. AS A FOLLOW UP,
A PROJECT WAS DEVISED ENABLING GROUPS OF CHILDREN TO COMPOSE PAGES OF TEXT
THEMSELVES. AN AUDIO-VISUAL PRESENTATION ON BOOK PRODUCTION FOR SCHOOL
AUDIENCES USING INSIGHTS GAINED FROM THIS SURVEY IS PLANNED.
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN BRAZILIAN TEENAGE FICTION.
     
AN EXTRACT FROM A WIDER STUDY SUPPORTED BY THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE
FOR EDUCATIONAL STUDY AND RESEARCH. PRELIMINARY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF PREVIOUS
STUDIES ON DISCRIMINATION IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE
TO BRAZILIAN WORK. A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 168 FICTION TITLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN
1950 AND 1975 WAS ANALYSED. USING A PREDETERMINED ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK LISTING
SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS, A SERIES OF RATINGS WAS OBTAINED FOR TREATMENT OF
CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATION AND IN TEXT, AND THE BEARING OF THE TEXT. RESULTS
ARE TABULATED AND CALCULATIONS PRESENTED IN FULL. IN GENERAL WHITE CHARACTERS
FIGURED PREDOMINANTLY AND WERE DEPICTED FAVOURABLY.
SMALL PRESS CHILDREN'S BOOKS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM.
     
ACCOUNT OF A PROJECT CARRIED OUT BY THE COOPERATIVE CHILDREN'S BOOK CENTER
(WISCONSIN) INTO THE PUBLISHING OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY SMALL/ALTERNATIVE
PRESSES. ALTERNATIVE PRESSES PUBLISH INDEPENDENTLY FOR PHILOSOPHICAL AND/OR
IDEOLOGICAL REASONS AND THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS PROJECT SET OUT TO ACQUIRE BOOKS
AND DEVELOP RESOURCES ABOUT ALTERNATIVE PRESS PUBLISHING FOR CHILDREN.
CONCLUDED THAT SUCH BOOKS ARE A VALUABLE SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND
INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN LIBRARY COLLECTIONS.
IDEOLOGICAL BIAS AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN BRAZIL.
     
PRESENTS THE CONCLUSIONS OF A PAPER GIVEN AT A BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON LITERATURE
FOR CHILDREN IN 1978. 21 CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORS WERE EXAMINED,
AND FOUND TO BE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO A RIGID PREDETERMINED STRUCTURE BASED ON
A CLEAR AND ABSOLUTE DEMARCATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, BACKED BY AN IDEOLOGY
LEGITIMISING THE POWER OF ADULTS OVER CHILDREN. DRAWS A PARALLEL WITH THE
SUBLITERATURE OF 19TH CENTURY FRANCE, AND POSTULATES THAT BRAZILIAN CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PRODUCT OF THE PREVAILING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
ORDER, REFLECTING IN THE DEPICTION OF THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP THE
PRODUCER-CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. THE INTRODUCTION OF
SUPERFICIALLY CONTEMPORARY MATERIAL IN LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL DETAIL DOES NOT
AFFECT THE ESSENTIALLY REACTIONARY CHARACTER OF SUCH WORKS, AND THIS
IDEOLOGICAL RIGIDITY EXPLAINS THEIR LOW LITERARY QUALITY.
VIEWPOINT' CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BRAZIL. THE LITERARY CRITIC.
     
DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE CRITIC IN ADVISING PARENTS, TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS
IN SELECTING READING MATERIAL THAT WILL ENRICH A CHILD'S EXPERIENCE. DESCRIBES
THE AESTHETIC AND EDUCATIONAL QUALITIES OF GOOD WRITING; THEN DISTINGUISHES
THIS CATEGORY FROM MEDIOCRE WRITING BASED ON CHEAP FANTASY AND FORCED REALISM
ON THE ONE HAND, AND FROM STRAIGHT DIDACTIC PROPAGANDA ON THE OTHER. THE
NECESSITY OF ENCOURAGING A LITERATURE OF RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY, AND
DISCOURAGING THE PERNICIOUS EVIL OF SUBLITERARY PRODUCTIONS, IS EMPHASISED.
SOME TRENDS IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
     
DISCUSSES SOME OF THE MAIN TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN UK CHILDREN'S BOOKS
DURING THE PAST 21 YEARS, AND MENTIONS A FEW NOTABLE TITLES. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY

LIBRARY OF THE NATIONAL BOOK LEAGUE'S SCOTTISH OFFICE, WHICH DISPLAYS ALL
CURRENT BRITISH CHILDREN'S BOOKS, AND ALSO PROVIDES BACKGROUND READING AND
INFORMATION ON CHILDREN'S READING.
VIEWPOINT' CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BRAZIL. THE PUBLISHER.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS OF ENCOURAGING BRAZILIAN AUTHORS TO PRODUCE GOOD WORK

INFLUENCE FROM ABROAD IN OTHER SPHERES, AND OUTLINES THE ESSENTIAL
REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY TO SUPPLANT
FOREIGN IMPORTS. THE EDITOR'S ROLE AS ENTREPRENEUR IN THE PRODUCTION OF
CHILDREN'S BOOKS IS OUTLINED.
SCHOOL BOOK SUPPLY).T
     
HE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO THE SUPPLY OF BOOKS TO SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
(CONVENED BY THE BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION AND THE PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION) HAS
ISSUED ITS FINDINGS. THIS ISSUE OF 2THE BOOKSELLER1 CONTAINS 3 ARTICLES ON
THIS SUBJECT. SCHOOL BOOK SUPPLY AT THE CROSSROADS' PRESENTS THE COMMITTEE'S
30 RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR, PROCEDURES FOR, AND COST
OF ORDERING AND SUPPLYING TEXTBOOKS AND LIBRARY BOOKS. IN ANOTHER ARTICLE OF
THE SAME TITLE, VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE REPORT ARE CONSIDERED IN DETAIL. IN

VIDEO IN SWEDEN (1).
     
DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIDEO IN SWEDEN AND COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY A
WORKING GROUP OF THE SWEDISH AUTHORS' UNION' 2VIDEO-FOR BETTER AND FOR WORSE1.
THE REPORT WARNS AGAINST THE NEGATIVE SIDES OF THE DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS
DOMINANCE BY COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS AND PASSIVITY AMONG VIEWERS, BUT ALSO POINTS
TO ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND PRODUCTION FOR MINORITIES. BUT
FOR THE POSITIVE SIDES TO BE DEVELOPED, STATE SUPPORT FOR PRODUCTION AND
DISTRIBUTION IS NECESSARY. THUS THE REPORT SUGGESTS FREE LOANS THROUGH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WITH STATE AID FOR EXTRA STAFF EMPLOYED, FINANCED POSSIBLY THROUGH
VARIOUS TAXES. SOME FORM OF EXPANSION OF FILM CENSORSHIP TO COVER VIDEO IS
NECESSARY. A GOVERNMENT REPORT ON VIDEO ADVERTISING SUGGESTS THAT IT BE
BANNED, IN THE SAME WAY AS TV ADVERTISING. FOR PART 2, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING
ABSTRACT.
VIDEO IN SWEDEN (PART 2).
     
COMMENTS ON THE SWEDISH VIDEO COMMISSION'S REPORT, PUBLISHED IN 1981. THE
REPORT DISCUSSES HOW VIDEO CAN BE USED TO STRENGTHEN FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.
QUALITY VIDEO FROM ABROAD MUST BE AVAILABLE. MINORITY GROUPS STAND TO BENEFIT
FROM VIDEO, AND DOMINATION BY COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MUST BE
OPPOSED. THE REPORT ASSIGNS A DECISIVE ROLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, WITH 'VIDEOGRAPHERS', MEDIA WORKSHOPS AND MEDIA 'CAFES'
ATTACHED TO LOCAL LIBRARIES. IT PROPOSES STATE SUBSIDISED PRODUCTION WITH THE
SWEDISH EDUCATIONAL RADIO, THE SWEDISH TELEVISION, AND THE SWEDISH FILM
INSTITUTE, AMONG OTHERS, AS PRODUCERS. DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES MIGHT
TAKE 3 FORMS' SHOWING IN LIBRARIES, LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETIES, VIA
CABLE TO HOMES AND INSTITUTIONS. FINANCING IS TO BE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE 1ST
YEAR AND BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THEREAFTER, WITH A POSSIBLE LENDING CHARGE.
THE REPORT'S THOROUGH SURVEY OF THE FIELD SHOULD PROVE USEFUL ALSO TO THE
OTHER NORDIC COUNTRIES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSALS IS, HOWEVER, UNCERTAIN
OWING TO THE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. FOR PART 1,
2SEE1 THE PREVIOUS ABSTRACT.

OF THE HEAVENS WERE IN EXISTENCE SOME TIME EARLIER. METHODS OF GLOBE
MANUFACTURE FROM THE 18TH CENTURY ONWARDS ARE DESCRIBED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED
FOR CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT. GLOBE MANUFACTURE FREQUENTLY INVOLVES WORK BY A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRAFTSMEN. A GEOGRAPHER, MATHEMATICIAN OR ASTRONOMER
CREATES THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN, THEN A CARPENTER PROVIDES A BASIC WOODEN
STRUCTURE WHICH IS COVERED WITH PAPER PASTE. THE MAP MUST BE CUT INTO SECTIONS
BEFORE BEING FIXED ONTO THE GLOBE AND THEN A TOP LAYER OF LIME OR CHALK IS
ADDED. AN ALTERNATIVE MANUFACTURING METHOD IS TO FILL A POTTERY MOULD WITH
PAPER MACHE. POCKET GLOBES ARE OFTEN MADE ENTIRELY OF WOOD. A GLOBE MUST BE
LIGHT, EASILY TURNED BUT PERFECTLY BALANCED.

AS THE US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. IF A
REQUEST LOOKS INTERESTING, KRI PREPARES A PROPOSAL INDICATING WHY IT, RATHER
THAN ITS COMPETITORS, SHOULD CONDUCT THE RESEARCH, AND IN THE AVERAGE MONTH
THE COMPANY HANDLES MORE THAN 15 PROJECTS, WITH MOST STAFF MEMBERS WORKING ON
SEVERAL PROJECTS AT ONCE.
FRIEDRICH ALTHOFF'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRUSSIAN-GERMAN
LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
FRIEDRICH ALTHOFF LIVED FROM 1839-1908. HE WAS THE OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY ADVISER
IN THE PRUSSIAN MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND THE MINISTRY'S DIRECTOR OF
UNIVERSITY AND FURTHER EDUCATION FROM 1897-1907. HE WAS CONVINCED THAT
LIBRARIES WERE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY AS A BASIS FOR ACADEMIC PROGRESS BUT ALSO IN
THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE AND NATIONAL AWARENESS. ALTHOFF WORKED IN CLOSE
COOPERATION WITH LIBRARY DIRECTORS, OTTO HARTWIG, KARL DZIATZKO AND AUGUST
WILMANNS. TOGETHER THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT INNOVATIONS IN
LIBRARY WORK WHICH WERE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE AND DEVELOPED THE PRUSSIAN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SYSTEM. AMONG THESE DEVELOPMENTS WERE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
PRUSSIAN LIBRARY COMPLETE CATALOGUE, THE IMPROVEMENT OF INTER-LENDING SYSTEMS
BETWEEN LIBRARIES, THE FOUNDING OF AN INFORMATION OFFICE OF GERMAN LIBRARIES
IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY IN BERLIN (1905) AND THE OPENING OF THE KAISER-WILHELM
LIBRARY  IN POSEN IN 1902.

POLITICAL. SHE SET UP 2BOOKLEGGER MAGAZINE1, A FEMINIST, RADICAL LIBRARY
JOURNAL, WITH OTHER WOMEN AND NOW PUBLISHES BOOKS UNDER THE BOOKLEGGER
IMPRINT.
LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY AND CENSORSHIP' THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHRISTIAN
LIBRARIAN.
     
ARGUES THAT CHRISTIAN LIBRARIANS MUST RECONCILE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NEED FOR
FREEDOM AND THE NEED FOR CONTROL, STATING THE CASE FOR SOME DEGREE OF CONTROL
OVER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS. OUTLINES FORMS OF LEGAL CONTROL' LIBEL AND
SLANDER; CONTEMPT; OFFICIAL SECRETS; RACE RELATIONS; BLASPHEMY; HORROR COMICS;
AND OBSCENITY LEGISLATION. PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR CHRISTIAN LIBRARIANS IN
EXERCISING NON-LEGAL CONTROL AND DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN
AND HIS DUTIES AS A CITIZEN, CHRISTIAN, PROFESSIONAL AND RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC
SERVANT. ADVICE FROM PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS
VALUABLE IN SELECTING MATERIALS OF A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH STANDARD.
PROVIDING A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE TO ETHNIC MINORITIES.

A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE IS ONLY LIKELY TO HAVE TO CATER FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES
IN URBAN AREAS. AFTER THE LOCAL ETHNIC MINORITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED A
REASONABLE STOCK OF BOOKS IN THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES MUST BE INCLUDED
BEARING IN MIND THAT SEVERAL ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE ENGLISH-SPEAKING E.G. WEST
INDIANS. STOCKS OF BOOKS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES MUST PERFORCE BE LIMITED SINCE
ETHNIC MINORITIES ALSO READ BOOKS ORIGINATING FROM THE DOMINANT CULTURE' A
SURFEIT WOULD ALSO ALIENATE THE NON-ETHNIC MINORITY USERS. THE PROBLEM OF
STOCK SELECTION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE BOOKS CAN BE OVERCOME BY USING ETHNIC
MINORITY STAFF.
SWEDISH PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS AND LINGUISTIC MINORITIES.

THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE GOALS OF SWEDISH IMMIGRATION
POLICY SHOULD BE EQUALITY, FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND COOPERATION. THESE AIMS APPLY
ALSO TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS AND ETHNIC MINORITIES. TODAY, SWEDISH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE OVER A MILLION BOOKS IN SOME 80 LANGUAGES. DESCRIBES THE
FINANCING OF SUCH SERVICES, SOURCES OF SUPPLY, PURCHASING AND CATALOGUING,
MEDIA SELECTION, NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES, AV MEDIA, INFORMATION, TRAINING OF
LIBRARY STAFF AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GRANTS FOR BOOKS AND PERIODICALS.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN DENMARK.

SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 1970S THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN OF FOREIGN CITIZENS HAS
INCREASED HEAVILY AS THE RELATIVES OF FOREIGN WORKERS WERE GIVEN ENTRY
PERMITS. DISCUSSES EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, PUBLIC LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS,
ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY MATERIAL, STOCKTAKING AND OTHER ASPECTS OF PROVISION
FOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN.
IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE NETHERLANDS.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN 250,000 IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR
RELATIVES FROM THE POORER MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES TOGETHER WITH A FURTHER
200,000 FROM THE FORMER DUTCH COLONIES. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BRANCH LIBRARIES
IN AREAS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANT RESIDENTS HAVE PROVIDED MATERIAL IN
THE IMMIGRANTS' NATIVE LANGUAGES. AT NATIONAL LEVEL THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) SET UP A
COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN JAN 78. THE
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE PUBLISHED IN 1979 RECOMMENDED THE NATIONAL
COORDINATION OF THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS FOR IMMIGRANTS AND THE
APPOINTMENT OF A STAFF-MEMBER AT THE NBLC WITH SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES' PLANS AT
UTRECHT PUBLIC LIBRARY.

IN 1981 A NEW POST WITH SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICES TO FOREIGN WORKERS
AND THEIR FAMILIES WAS CREATED AT UTRECHT PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS.
UTRECHT HAS ALMOST 20,000 IMMIGRANTS, MAINLY FROM THE POORER MEDITERRANEAN
COUNTRIES AND THE NEW POST WAS THE RESULT OF A REPORT PUBLISHED IN 1980 ON THE
PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANT WORKERS. THE REPORT RECOGNISED THE
DIFFICULTIES IN PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES AND RECOMMENDED ENLISTING THE AID OF
IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN SELECTING, OBTAINING AND PROCESSING MATERIAL FOR THE
LIBRARY. TO PUBLICISE ITS SERVICES THE LIBRARY IS ENDEAVOURING TO CONTACT
LOCAL ORGANISATIONS CONCERNED WITH THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL WELFARE OF
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND TO GIVE PRESENTATIONS ON THE LIBRARY'S SERVIVES AT
MEETINGS OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS.
NON-USE AND LOSER STUDIES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
JULY 80. ARGUES THAT USE AND USER STUDIES HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED, OR
BEEN INFLUENTIAL IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET
HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED.
SUGGESTS THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF THE
COMMUNITY IS ESSENTIAL TO THE DESIGN OF LIBRARY SERVICES, POLICIES AND GOALS,
AND TO THE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF STUDIES OF COLLECTION USE AND USER
PATTERNS. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY AN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THIS.
A STUDY OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF USERS OF THE SERVICES OF A SPECIAL LIBRARY.

REPORT OF AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT AT THE BRAZILIAN NUCLEAR ENERGY
RESEARCH INSTITUTE (INSTITUTO DE PESQUISAS ENERGETICAS E NUCLEARES) IN 1979,
TO ESTABLISH REASONS FOR LOW USE OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SERVICES, FOR PLANNING AND REORGANISATION PURPOSES. A
PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF RECENT LITERATURE ON LIBRARY USER STUDIES IS PRESENTED.
DATA WAS COLLECTED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND FROM STATISTICAL RECORDS. RESULTS ARE
REPORTED IN FULL, GIVING DETAILS OF USER CHARACTERISTICS; HABITS OF LIBRARY
FREQUENTATION; USE OF SERVICES; USE OF LIBRARY PUBLICATIONS; AND THE INFLUENCE
OF USER TRAINING ON LIBRARY HABITS. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESES, THAT SERVICES WERE
NOT GEARED TO EXISTING USER HABITS ALTHOUGH ADEQUATE FOR RESEARCH NEEDS, AND
THAT PREVIOUS TRAINING INCREASED USE, WERE BORNE OUT. THE NEED TO PROMOTE
SERVICES IS EMPHASISED IN CONCLUSION.
EVALUATING COLLECTIONS BY THEIR USE.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
NEW YORK, JULY 80. DISCUSSES SOME METHODS OF EVALUATING A LIBRARY COLLECTION
IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME AND TYPE OF USE IT RECEIVES. DESCRIBES THE FINDINGS OF
SEVERAL STUDIES OF CIRCULATION PATTERNS, INCLUDING SOME DERIVED FROM MACHINE
READABLE RECORDS. DISCUSSES THE APPLICATION, AND RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF 2 TYPES OF STUDIES OF COLLECTION USE-DOCUMENT DELIVERY TESTS,
AND SHELF AVAILABILITY STUDIES. INDICATES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS
ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH STUDIES, AND POINTS OUT THAT A CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE WILL
BE MADE WHEN THE METHODOLOGIES NOW APPLIED TO ONE-TIME EVALUATIONS ARE
MODIFIED SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF PERFORMANCE.
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO USERS' THE CASE OF THE POLYTECHNIC
LIBRARY, IBADAN.

(MLS THESIS). ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERVICES AT THE
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY, AT IBADAN (NIGERIA), TO ITS USERS AND EMPLOYING READER
SATISFACTION AS THE TEST OF LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS VIA A QUESTIONNAIRE
TECHNIQUE.
AROUSING AN INTEREST OR LOVE IN READERS, LITERARY CHILDREN AND YOUTH.

DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH TO MAKE THE LIBRARY MORE APPEALING. THE NEED TO TALK
TO CHILDREN AND DISCOVER THEIR INTERESTS IS STRESSED. A LACK OF INTEREST IN
BOOKS IS OFTEN A RESULT OF TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE CHILD'S OWN READING
ABILITIES. DISCUSSES SURVEYS DONE ON WHAT READING MATTER APPEALS MOST TO
DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES: THE LITERACY PLACE.

BASED ON A SPEECH GIVEN AT THE OTTAWA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE, OCT 81.
LIBRARIES IN ONTARIO WERE CONTACTED IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE CHILDREN'S
LITERACY PROJECTS. SPECIAL PROGRAMMES WERE FOUND AT ETOBICOKE, NORTH YORK AND
LONDON. WINDSOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SPECIALISES IN READING TO CHILDREN. SOME
LIBRARIES OFFER PRACTICAL WORKSHOPS; DO THEY HELP LITERACY? AUTHOR SUSAN
GLAZER SPECIFIES 7 LANGUAGE EXERCISES' LISTENING; WRITING; ACTING; PLAYING;
CONSTRUCTING; READING; THINKING. THE LIBRARY SHOULD SUPPLY ALL SITUATIONS
CONDUCIVE TO THESE ACTIVITIES, E.G. STORY HOURS, BOOK MAKING, DRAMA GROUPS,
CRAFTS. OBSERVATION OF THE CHILDREN AND OF THEIR ATTENTION AND PROGRESS, AND
CONTACT WITH PARENTS, ARE ADVISED.
BIBLIOTHERAPY' LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE SICK.

AN INTRODUCTION TO BIBLIOTHERAPY-THE USE OF BOOKS AND RELATED MATERIALS IN THE
TREATMENT OF THE SICK. THROUGH SELECTED ACTIVITY INVOLVING PLANNED, CONDUCTED,
CONTROLLED READING, BIBLIOTHERAPY MAY BE USED TO DEAL WITH EMOTIONAL AND OTHER
PROBLEMS. DESCRIBES THE INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH BIBLIOTHERAPY MAY BE USED, AND
THE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE ON THE TREATMENT TEAM WITHIN SUCH AN INSTITUTION.
LOTKA'S TEST.

PRESENTS A STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE FOR TESTING IF A GIVEN SET OF AUTHOR
PRODUCTIVITY DATA CONFORMS TO LOTKA'S LAW. THE STEPS PROPOSED ARE' COLLECTION
OF DATA; DETERMINATION OF THE SLOPE +N; CALCULATION OF THE CONSTANT +C; AND
APPLICATION OF KOLMOGOROV-SMIROV ONE SAMPLE GOODNESS-OF-FIT TEST TO
EXPERIMENTAL AND CALCULATED DATA.
NORDINFO COURSE IN BIBLIOMETRICS, 1981-10-26-29, HANASSARI, HELSINKI,
SWEDISH-FINNISH CULTURAL CENTRE (IN SWEDISH).

DESCRIBES THE DISCIPLINE OF BIBLIOMETRICS WITH REFERENCE TO A NORDINFO COURSE
ATTENDED IN HELSINKI. DEFINES BIBLIOMETRICS AS QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE USED ON A GLOBAL SCALE, BUT
THEY CAN ALSO BE A TOOL TO CALCULATE THE BEST USE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY'S
RESOURCES. AMONG THE EMPIRICAL LAWS DEVELOPED, BRADFORD'S LAW IS THE MOST
APPLICABLE. DESCRIBES THE USE OF THIS LAW TO OBTAIN A GRAPH WITH AN
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING PART, A SO-CALLED BRADFORD GRAPH. THIS CAN SHOW THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTHORS AND NUMBER OF ARTICLES, ARTICLES AND QUOTATIONS
AND CAN HELP TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS OF OBSOLESCENCE OF LITERATURE IN A
LIBRARY. OTHER BIBLIOMETRIC LAWS ARE THOSE OF LOTKA AND ZIPF. THE METHODS ARE
USEFUL IN ACQUISITION, PLANNING OF SPACE ALLOCATION, WITHDRAWALS, LIBRARY USE,
AND OTHER AREAS OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION.
COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR ANALYSIS OF BIBLIOMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS.

(MSC DISSERTATION-CITY UNIVERSITY, LONDON). A SUITE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS IS
GIVEN FOR THE ANALYSIS OF AUTHOR AND JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DATA. THE PROGRAMS
WERE WRITTEN USING SUBPROGRAMS FROM THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND USING THE FORTRAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THE
AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS 1ST PROCESS RAW AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY DATA
(CONSISTING OF AUTHOR CODES AND ARTICLE NUMBERS). THEN THE WEIBULL, NEGATIVE
BINOMIAL AND 2 FORMS OF THE LOTKA DISTRIBUTION ARE COMPARED WITH THE OBSERVED
DISTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY, USING THE CHI SQUARED AND
KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS. THE JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS
ALLOW RAW JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DATA (CONSISTING OF JOURNAL CODES AND ARTICLE
NUMBERS) TO BE PROCESSED. THE PROCESSED DATA IS USED TO PLOT BRADFORD, YIELD
FORMULA AND NARANAN GRAPHS BY COMPUTER. REASONS FOR CHOOSING THESE AUTHOR AND
JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE G IVEN, AND APPLICATIONS OF THE
PROGRAMS IN OTHER AREAS OF BIBLIOMETRICS ARE EXAMINED. FINALLY, USEFUL
DEVELOPMENTS TO THE SUITE OF PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERED.
BRADFORD'S LAW OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC SCATTER.

ANALYSES THE AMBIGUITY INHERENT IN BRADFORD'S LAW, AND ATTRIBUTES THIS TO THE
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE VERBAL AND GRAPHICAL FORMS OF ITS EXPRESSION.
DEMONSTRATES HOW BRADFORD'S LAW CAN BE REWRITTEN SO THAT THEORY AND EMPIRICAL
RESULTS WILL CORRESPOND EXACTLY. TO EXTEND THE PRACTICAL USE OF SUCH A
MATHEMATICAL MODEL, INTRODUCES THE CONCEPTS OF NORMAL SITUATION AND
NORMALISATION OF RESEARCH, AND USES ZIPF'S 2ND LAW TO ESTABLISH A MODEL VALID
FOR NORMAL SITUATIONS BUT WITH WIDER APPLICATION AND GREATER OBJECTIVITY THAN
BRADFORD'S.
THE SCATTER OF ARTICLES ACCORDING TO BRADFORD'S LAW OF SCATTER' A BIBLIOMETRIC
ANALYSIS.

REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT TO VERIFY BRADFORD'S LAW IN A PARTICULAR CASE
AND COMPILE AS COMPLETE A BIBLIOGRAPHY AS POSSIBLE ON RESEARCH ON BRADFORD'S
LAW. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HOW THE REFERENCES WERE COLLECTED, USING SERIALS
COLLECTIONS IN THE SAO PAULO UNIVERSITY, AND CALCULATIONS PRESENTED IN FULL.
THE RESULTS OBTAINED WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.
COMIC STRIPS AND COMICS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES?.

THE BAVARIAN SECTION OF THE VEREIN DER BIBLIOTHEKARE AN OFFENTLICHEN
BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES) HELD AN ADVANCED
TRAINING SESSION IN MAR 82 ON THE USE OF COMICS AND OTHER STORIES IN PICTURE
FORM IN LIBRARIES. SUBJECTS DISCUSSED INCLUDED' THE HISTORY OF COMICS IN THE
USA, FRANCE AND GERMANY; TERMINOLOGY; MARKETING AND PRODUCTION; PURCHASING;
AND THE USES OF THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL FOR ADULTS, YOUNG CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS
IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. POPULAR THEMES IN COMICS INCLUDE ADVENTURE, TRAVEL,
ANIMALS AND MEN AND SUPERMAN INVOLVED IN THE CONQUEST OF EVIL. WHILE A
REGRETTABLE TENDENCY TOWARDS VIOLENT AND AGGRESSIVE MATERIAL IS APPARENT, THE
TENDENCY IS OFTEN LESS STRONG HERE THAN IN OTHER MEDIA.
IMPROVING ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, JUNE 81. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS
CONCERNED WITH THE SUCCESSFUL IDENTIFICATION AND RETRIEVAL OF US GOVERNMENT
PUBLICATIONS. DESCRIBES AN 'IDEAL' SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT
PUBLICATIONS, AND OUTLINES AN ACTION PROGRAMME FOR ACHIEVING THIS. HIGHLIGHTS
THE IMPORTANCE OF' ASSESSING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF POTENTIAL CLIENTELE;
PUBLICISING AND ENCOURAGING THE USE OF THE COLLECTION; OBTAINING SUFFICIENT
RESOURCES; STAFF TRAINING; IMPROVING THE COMPREHENSIVENESS AND SIMPLICITY OF
THE SYSTEMS USED TO ACCESS THE PUBLICATIONS; AND MAINTENANCE OF THE
COLLECTION.
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK AT THE SWEDISH
PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY.

ARTICLE PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF IFLA, GENERAL RESEARCH COUNCIL,
1981. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE HISTORY OF THE 2ANNUAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SWEDISH

DISCUSSION OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF KEMAL ATATURK IN PROMOTING EDUCATION AND THE
EUROPEANISATION OF TURKEY, WITH A SKETCH OF MODERN BOOK PRODUCTION AND THE
AVAILABILITY OF RARE EDITIONS.
LOCAL AND REGIONAL COLLECTIONS.

TEXT OF A 1978 CONFERENCE PAPER DISCUSSING ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
POLICIES. CONSIDERS FIRSTLY THE MATERIALS CONSTITUTING A LOCAL COLLECTION IN
RELATION TO GEOGRAPHICAL RELEVANCE AND CRITERIA FOR SELECTION' WORKS BY LOCAL
AUTHORS, PRODUCED BY LOCAL PRINTERS, OR DEALING WITH LOCAL SUBJECTS, ARE
CONSIDERED, AS WELL AS OFFICIAL ADMINISTRATIVE PUBLICATIONS AND EPHEMERA. THEN
PROBLEMS OF EXPLOITATION AND CONSERVATION ARE EXAMINED, IN AN ATTEMPT TO
RECONCILE ARCHIVAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH USER NEEDS' THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL
USERS, FROM SCHOLARLY RESEARCHERS TO INTERESTED NON-SPECIALISTS, IS DISCUSSED
IN RELATION TO PREPARATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL TOOLS PERMITTING MULTIPLE ACCESS
TO THE COLLECTION TO CATER FOR VARIED APPROACHES; BASIC COMMONSENSE
PRECAUTIONS ARE SUGGESTED FOR MINIMISING DAMAGE TO BOOK MATERIALS, AND SPECIAL
MEASURES FOR MINOR DOCUMENTS PROPOSED. EMPHASISES THAT EACH LIBRARIAN MUST
EVOLVE HIS OWN POLICY TO MEET HIS OWN PARTICULAR SITUATION.

INVESTIGATION OF PERIODICAL RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSITY, PRIOR TO THE
INTEGRATION OF ALL THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SERVICES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
INSTITUTE LIBRARY IN RELATION TO PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS RENDERING IT
ATYPICAL OF THE LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THE OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGY, DATA
COLLECTION PROCEDURES, CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS OF THE STUDY ARE PRESENTED IN
FULL, WITH ACCOMPANYING TABLES AND DIAGRAMS. MODIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR
APPLYING THE PILOT PROCEDURES TO THE MAJOR STUDY ARE NOTED, WITH REFERENCE TO
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS, PHYSICAL, HUMAN, AND FINANCIAL, OBSERVED
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TESTING PHASE.
EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PERIODICAL COLLECTION IN THE MEDICAL LIBRARY AT THE
FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL.

REPORT, PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE IN 1979, BY A WORKING GROUP SET UP TO
INVESTIGATE PERIODICAL COLLECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF RIO
GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES, AND
PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MEDICAL
LIBRARY COLLECTION DID NOT ADEQUATELY MEET USER NEEDS. CONCLUDING
RECOMMENDATIONS COVER THE POINTS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION, AND LISTS OF
CRITERIA ARE PRESENTED FOR EVALUATING INDIVIDUAL PERIODICAL USE AND THE STATE
OF THE COLLECTION AS A WHOLE, TO PERMIT CONTINUING EVALUATION.

THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT CENSORSHIP?.

REPLY TO AN ARTICLE BY E.J. GROESKAMP IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN SAMENLEVING 9 (12) DEC
81, 333-337 (FOR AN ABSTRACT OF WHICH 2SEE1 82/4167), IN WHICH ATTENTION WAS
DRAWN TO THE HIDDEN CENSORSHIP PRACTISED BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES. GROESKAMP'S
DEFINITION OF CENSORSHIP SHOULD MORE PROPERLY BE TERMED 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL
GROUNDS'. BECAUSE OF LACK OF SPACE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, LIBRARIES CANNOT
PURCHASE ALL BOOKS PUBLISHED AND SELECTION IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A BALANCED
COLLECTION OF MATERIAL. THE FACTS ON WHICH GROESKAMP'S ARGUMENTS ARE BASED
INCLUDE 2 LIBRARY SURVEYS, OF WHICH 1 CONTAINED INSUFFICIENT DATA TO DRAW ANY
FIRM CONCLUSIONS, WHILE THE OTHER PRODUCED RESULTS IN CONFLICT WITH
GROESKAMP'S DEDUCTIONS. FOR FINANCIAL REASONS IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THAT IN A
COMMUNITY OF 1 RELIGIOUS PERSUASION FEW BOOKS OF A DIFFERENT PERSUASION ARE
LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY.
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOY LIBRARIES.

THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF TOY LIBRARIES IN STOCKHOLM 1981 INCLUDED
PAPERS, LECTURES, WORKSHOPS, AN EXTENSIVE TOY EXHIBITION, AND VISITS TO
HOSPITALS, DAY NURSERIES, CLINICS, PRESCHOOLS AND TOY LIBRARIES. APART FROM
LOANING TOYS, A TOY LIBRARY AIMS TO ADVISE AND STIMULATE THROUGH PLAY,
PARTICULARLY TO DEPRIVED FAMILIES. VISITS (IN SWEDEN) ARE BY APPOINTMENT AND
DOCTOR'S REFERRAL. TOYS ARE SELECTED ACCORDING TO THE CHILD'S CURRENT NEEDS.
SIBLINGS ARE INVOLVED. COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY SUPPORTING TOY LIBRARIES INCLUDE
DENMARK, SWEDEN, THE NETHERLANDS, ICELAND, UK AND ITALY. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE
RARELY INVOLVED.
TOY LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA. A REPORT WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEIR ROLE IN
SERVICES FOR YOUNG HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE GROWTH OF TOY LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN RAPID AND EXTENSIVE DURING
THE 70S AND TOY LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES.
HOWEVER, EVIDENCE POINTS TO A LACK OF AWARENESS ON THE PART OF LAY PEOPLE AND
PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS OF TOY LIBRARIES; ESPECIALLY IN
THEIR ROLE OF SERVING HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE AIM OF THE
STUDY IS TO HELP OVERCOME THIS LACK OF INFORMATION AND BE OF ASSISTANCE TO
POLICY MAKERS AND THOSE DEVELOPING SERVICES WHICH IMPINGE ON AREAS IN WHICH
TOY LIBRARIES ARE PRESENTLY INVOLVED.
AUDIOVISUAL AIDS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.

IN THE PAST 10 YEARS AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS HAVE BECOME AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE
LIBRARY SUPPLIES OFFERED IN WEST GERMANY. AT THE SAME TIME THE DIFFERENT AID
MEDIA HAVE DEVELOPED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT AIDS
AVAILABLE IN SOUND RECORDING MEDIA, VIDEO AND SLIDES AND FILMS. ALSO MENTIONS
THE SERVICES OF THE EINKAUFSZENTRALE FUR OFFENTLICH BIBLIOTHEKEN REVIEWING AND
READING DEPARTMENTS AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF CATALOGUING SOUND RECORDING MEDIA.
NATIONAL SERVICE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE FIELD OF AUDIOVISUAL MEDIA. THE
SITUATION IN THE NETHERLANDS.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHICH HAVE LEAD TO THE INCLUSION
OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE CENTRAL SERVICES TO
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THIS FIELD. MENTIONS PROBLEMS REGARDING THE INCLUSION OF
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THE EFFECTS OF THE 1975 PUBLIC
LIBRARIES ACT WHICH MADE PROVISION FOR AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS, THE WORK OF THE
NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH LIBRARY AND LITERATURE
CENTRE) AND PRESENT PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES OF THE AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICE.
SINCE 1981 THE NBLC HAS PROVIDED A CENTRALISED SUPPLY OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THIS SERVICE HAS ENABLED LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE
THEIR AUDIO-VISUAL STOCK.
SERVICES AND MATERIALS FOR THE HANDICAPPED' AN INSTITUTE FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY
MEDIA PROFESSIONALS (DEKALB, ILLINOIS, AUGUST 12-17, 1979).

CONTAINS A NARRATIVE AND 2 EVALUATIONS OF A WEEK-LONG INSTITUTE ON MEDIA
SERVICES FOR HANDICAPPED STUDENTS WHICH WAS HELD AT NORTHERN ILLINOIS
UNIVERSITY. PURPOSES OF THE INSTITUTE WERE TO' (1) EXTEND THE ABILITIES OF
SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE MEDIA SERVICES TO HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN; (2) SUPPLY INFORMATION ON SOURCES OF MATERIALS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT
FOR THE HANDICAPPED; (3) PROVIDE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO
PRESENT IN-SERVICE SESSIONS FOR TEACHERS ON SERVICE TO THE HANDICAPPED; (4)
HELP PARTICIPANTS COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ABOUT
AVAILABLE SERVICES; AND (5) STIMULATE GREATER INITIATIVE AND INVOLVEMENT IN
THIS ASPECT OF SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SERVICES. PARTICIPANTS IN THE INSTITUTE
WERE PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN THE APPLICATION OF LIBRARY MEDIA SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN RELATION TO SPECIAL EDUCATI ON. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
U.S. GOVERNMENT PRODUCED AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS.

US GOVERNMENT PRODUCED AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS OFFER A VALUABLE INFORMATION
RESOURCE WHICH IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY USERS. THE
LIBRARIAN WHO IS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THEIR AVAILABILITY WILL BE ABLE TO BRING
THESE AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS TO THE ATTENTION OF LIBRARY PATRONS TO WHOM THEY
COULD BE USEFUL. KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDEXES AND LISTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY
COMPILED FOR THESE RESOURCES WILL MAKE THEM AS ACCESSIBLE AS THE MORE FAMILIAR
PRINT GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.
MICROGRAPHICS AND THE LIBRARY. A GRADUATE COURSE.

THE COMPLETE SYLLABUS FOR A 15-SESSION COURSE IN MICROGRAPHICS AND THEIR
ACQUISITION, HANDLING, INTERPRETATION, AND UTILISATION IN LIBRARIES IS
PRESENTED. SEMINAR TOPICS COVER THE SELECTION OF EQUIPMENT, MICROFORM
STANDARDS, COM, RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON MICROFORM, MICROPUBLISHING, RECORDS
MANAGEMENT LABORATORIES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF MICROFORMS IN LIBRARIES AND
INDUSTRY, AND THE CREATION AND EVALUATION OF THE MICROFORM ENVIRONMENT. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CONVERSION OF SERIALS FROM PAPER TO MICROFORM.

EXAMINES THE ADVANTAGES TRADITIONALLY ASCRIBED TO MICROFORMAT SERIALS, SUCH AS
COST AND SPACE SAVING, PERMANENCE, AND EASE OF HANDLING, IN THE LIGHT OF NEW
COST COMPARISONS, CONTINUED USER RESISTANCE AND THE UNCERTAIN RESULTS OF
PERMANENCE STUDIES.
VIDEOCASSETTE COLLECTION AT MORGANTOWN PUBLIC LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE VIDEOCASSETTE MOVIE COLLECTION AT MORGANTOWN PUBLIC LIBRARY,
WEST VIRGINIA, WITH DETAILS OF SOME OF ITS MOST POPULAR ITEMS. DURING ITS 1ST
YEAR THE COLLECTION GREW TO ITS TARGET OF 100 CASSETTES, AND THE CORE
COLLECTION IS EXPANDING FURTHER. CIRCULATION FIGURES HAVE RISEN STEEPLY.
MOVIES ARE RATED BEFORE SCREENING, AND THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON
BORROWING, WITH CHECKS ON PATRONS COPYING THE LIBRARY'S VIDEOCASSETTES AND
SWITCHING COPIES WITH THEIR OWN.
THE VIDEOGRAM REPORT-PUBLISHED TOO LATE?.

THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION'S REPORT SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
DISTRIBUTION CENTRES FOR A BROAD SUPPLY OF GOOD QUALITY VIDEO RECORDINGS, BUT
VIDEO HAS ALREADY BECOME A MASS MARKET ARTICLE SUPPLIED THROUGH INTERNATIONAL
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND LIBRARIES HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF MAKING AN IMPACT. A
WORKING GROUP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, THE VIDMO-GROUP,
WAS FORMED ALREADY IN 1973; IT HOPED TO START EXPERIMENTS IN LIBRARIES WITH
PRODUCTION AND SHOWING OF VIDEOGRAMS, BUT TRADE UNION OPPOSITION MEANT THAT
THE SWEDISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION'S PROGRAMMES COULD NOT BE USED. OTHER
REPORTS HAVE APPEARED POINTING TO THE ADVANTAGES OF LIBRARIES AS DISTRIBUTORS
OF VIDEO, BUT WITHOUT STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL NEVER BE
ABLE TO FULFIL THIS ROLE. SOME AREAS ARE, HOWEVER, OPEN TO LIBRARIES, PROVIDED
THEY COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS' VIDEOGRAMS FOR THE
DEAF AND OTHER HANDICAPPED; VIDEOGRAMS PRODUCED  DIRECTLY FOR THE MEDIUM BY
ARTISTS AND MEDIA WORKSHOPS; VIDEOGRAMS FOR CHILDREN; FOR EDUCATION IN
COOPERATION WITH THE EDUCATIONAL RADIO AND THE AV CENTRE; AND LOCALLY PRODUCED
MATERIAL FOR VIDEO.
THE IMPACT OF USER FRUSTRATION OF HUMANITIES RESEARCH.

REPORTS ON A SURVEY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE CONSEQUENCE OF USER
FRUSTRATION AMONG HUMANITIES FACULTIES CAUSED BY COLLECTION INADEQUACY AT
VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY. RESULTS INDICATE THAT
SUCH FRUSTRATION DOES EXIST, BUT THE LACK OF A STRONG HUMANITIES COLLECTION IS
NOT DEEMED TO BE AN UNSURMOUNTABLE IMPEDIMENT TO RESEARCH. THE FREEDOM AND
ENCOURAGEMENT TO TRAVEL TO PRIMARY SOURCES AND A COMFORTABLE WORK ENVIRONMENT
WITH EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE SERVICES IS MOST IMPORTANT.
THE VISNEWS FILM LIBRARY.

VISNEWS IS 1 OF THE WORLD'S LEADING NEWSFILM AGENCIES AND SUPPLIES MATERIAL TO
TV STATIONS. ITS LIBRARY IN LONDON IS HELD TO BE THE LARGEST AND MOST
COMPREHENSIVE OF ITS KIND. IT HAS A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF NEWSFILM SOME OF
WHICH DATES BACK TO 1896' BESIDES ITS OWN COLLECTION IT OWNS 5 OTHER MAJOR
CINEMA NEWSREEL COLLECTIONS FROM THE PAST. AN EXTENSIVE CARD INDEX CATALOGUES
THE COLLECTIONS UNDER A VARIETY OF HEADINGS SUCH AS SUBJECT, LOCATION,
PERSONALITIES ETC. MUCH OF THE OLD NITRATE HOLDINGS ARE NOW ON VIDEO BUT THE
LIBRARY PREFERS TO KEEP MATERIAL ON FILM. VIEWING FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND
COMPILATION OF ANY VISNEWS LIBRARY MATERIAL IS POSSIBLE ON PAYMENT.
THE MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE' AN INTERDISCIPLINARY
CROSS-CITATION ANALYSIS.

A METHOD IS PROPOSED FOR MEASURING INTERDISCIPLINARY RELATIONS IN SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE BASED ON CROSS CITATION AMONG CORE JOURNALS EMPIRICALLY SELECTED ON
THE BASIS OF USE AND IMPORTANCE. THE METHOD IS USED TO TEST HYPOTHESES DERIVED
FROM A BIBLIOMETRIC DEFINITION OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY AMONG THE MANAGEMENT AND
SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURES. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE MANAGEMENT LITERATURE
IS DEPENDENT ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, THAT IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAN VICE
VERSA, AND THAT IT IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAN THEY ARE ON EACH OTHER.
EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES INFORMATION-HOW TO TRACK IT DOWN AND KEEP PACE WITH IT,
PART 2.

CONTINUATION OF A PREVIOUS ARTICLE (2SEE1 81/5645) WHICH LOOKED AT MAJOR
SOURCE MATERIALS RELATING TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES. DISCUSSES BRIEFLY'
SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND STATISTICAL PUBLICATIONS; COMMERCIAL ABSTRACTING
SERVICES; PERIODICALS; GRANTS AND LOAN INFORMATION; DATA SYSTEMS; AUDIO-VISUAL
GUIDES; AND EUROPEAN DOCUMENTATION CENTRES AND DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES.
ABIDING BY THE LAW' LEGAL MATERIALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

INCREASINGLY, LAW MATERIALS ARE NEEDED BY AN EVER-WIDENING RANGE OF PEOPLE,
AND SINCE THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION MOST READILY AVAILABLE TO THE AVERAGE
PERSON IS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE THE MOST CONVENIENT
LOCATION FOR LEGAL INFORMATION. EXAMINES THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACCESS TO
INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO INDIVIDUAL LEGAL PRACTICE AND THE ATTITUDES OF
LAWYERS, AND SUGGESTS SOME BASIC LEGAL TEXTS FOR A CORE COLLECTION. HINTS ARE
GIVEN ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE COLLECTION, AND THE MORE IMPORTANT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AIDS ARE CITED.
PICK A TITLE 2' A COLLECTION OF MEDIA ABOUT THE HANDICAPPED.

THE LISTING OF BOOKS, FILMS, SOUND CASSETTES, AND OTHER MEDIA ABOUT THE
HANDICAPPED IS DIVIDED INTO 3 INTEREST LEVEL AREAS; PRE-SCHOOL AND PRIMARY,
MIDDLE OR INTERMEDIATE, AND YOUNG ADULT AND ADULT. A SECTION FOR PARENTS
CONTAINS INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS FOR USE IN THE HOME. ALSO INCLUDED IS A
PROFESSIONAL SECTION FOR USE BY TEACHERS, SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, AND OTHER
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH HANDICAPPED STUDENTS. EACH CITATION INCLUDES
A PRICE AND A SHORT CONTENT SUMMARY; THE ADDRESSES OF PUBLISHERS CITED ARE
GIVEN AT THE END OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
DIACHRONOUS VS. SYNCHRONOUS STUDY OF OBSOLESCENCE.

(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN). A COMPARISON OF 2
WAYS OF MEASURING OBSOLESCENCE WITHIN THE SUBJECT OF HUMAN AND MEDICAL
GENETICS. SYNCHRONOUS STUDIES (WHICH ARE MADE ON RECORDS OF USE OR
BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES MADE AT 1 POINT IN TIME AND COMPARE THE USE AGAINST
THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIAL USED OR CITED) ARE MORE EASILY APPLIED
AND PRODUCE EQUIVALENT RESULTS TO THE APPARENTLY MORE THEORETICALLY DESIRABLE
DIACHRONOUS STUDIES (WHICH FOLLOW THE USE OF PARTICULAR ITEMS THROUGH
SUCCESSIVE OBSERVATIONS AT DIFFERENT DATES).
CITATION ANALYSIS AND BIBLIOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CORE PERIODICALS.

A REPORT OF THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF A SPANISH STATE SPONSORED RESEARCH
PROJECT. THE ANALYSIS COVERS CITATIONS OF PAPERS ON ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES
IN 2CANCER RESEARCH1 FROM 1976-79. A TOTAL OF 7,815 REFERENCES TO 576
PERIODICALS CARRIED IN 284 PAPERS WAS OBTAINED, AND THE BRADFORD TECHNIQUE
APPLIED TO ASCERTAIN THE CORE PERIODICALS RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1 CITATION
PER MONTH. A COMPARISON WAS THEN MADE BETWEEN CORE AND NON-CORE PERIODICAL
THEMATIC COVERAGE OF 8 ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES; AND THE QUANTITATIVE
DIFFERENCE IN DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE 2 SETS OF PERIODICALS FOR GENERAL AND
SPECIFIC THEMATIC DISTRIBUTION ESTABLISHED. FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ALL
CALCULATIONS MADE, AND RESULTS TABULATED. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT ONLY
THE CORE PERIODICALS CAN SATISFY THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIELD,
AS REGARDS THEMATIC COVERAGE AND CITATION FREQUENCY.
ANALYSIS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PRODUCTION AT THE UFMG VETERINARY MEDICINE SCHOOL,
BRAZIL, FROM 1973 TO 1977.

EXTRACT FROM A POSTGRADUATE DISSERTATION PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,
BRAZIL. THE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE DIRECTIONS OF RESEARCH
INTERESTS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE ORGANISATION AND PERSONNEL OF THE SCHOOL.
ALL PERIODICAL ARTICLES PUBLISHED BY STAFF WERE ANALYSED BY PLACE OF
PUBLICATION; LANGUAGE; SINGLE AND MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP; AND SUBJECT
DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SCHOOL'S RESEARCH PROGRAMMES SUPPORTED
GOVERNMENT, STATE AND UNIVERSITY OBJECTIVES.
BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES ON A PROTEIN-RICH CROP: THE COWPEA.

2 BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON COWPEAS, ONE COVERING THE PERIOD 1888-1949 AND THE OTHER
1950-1973, WERE ANALYSED TO STUDY VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LITERATURE.
RESULTS SHOWED THAT GROWTH OF THE LITERATURE HAS BEEN EXPONENTIAL, DOUBLING
EVERY 20 YEARS, WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 87% OF THE
LITERATURE. THOUGH THE PERIODICAL WAS THE MOST POPULAR PUBLISHING MEDIUM,
FORMAT CHANGES WERE EVIDENT AND BRADFORD DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE 2 GROUPS
RESULTED IN A THIRD BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION WHEN MERGED.
THE EXAMINATION OF RESEARCH TRENDS BY ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATION NUMBERS.

DESCRIBES A METHOD USED TO EXAMINE TRENDS IN TEXTILE RESEARCH OVER THE PERIOD
1960-79. THE METHOD CONSISTED OF A COUNT OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND PATENTS, IN
SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS, USING 2WORLD TEXTILE ABSTRACTS1, 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1,
2JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE1 AND 2TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL1 AS SOURCES
OF DATA. THE STATISTICAL PROCEDURES USED TO PROCESS THE DATA ARE BRIEFLY
INDICATED.

THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY'S FISHER LIBRARY HOLDS A COLLECTION OF CRIME FICTION
THAT RANKS 3RD OR 4TH IN SIZE IN THE WORLD-NEARLY 18,000 VOLUMES. DESCRIBES
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COLLECTION, STARTED IN THE EARLY 1970S. SECONDARY
MATERIAL ON THE GENRE HAS BEEN OBTAINED TO FACILITATE RESEARCH. DISCUSSES THE
VALUES OFFERED BY CRIME FICTION.
REGIONAL COLLABORATION IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE BASICALLY OPERATED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE
STATE CAN PROVIDE GRANTS TO LEVEL OUT STANDARDS BUT DOES NOT INTERFERE IN THE
RUNNING OF LOCAL LIBRARIES, AND SWEDEN HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT. MUNICIPAL
AUTHORITIES THEMSELVES DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES, SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF THEIR
LIBRARY SERVICES. ALL OF SWEDEN'S 279 MUNICIPALITIES PROVIDE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY
SERVICES. CERTAIN LIBRARY FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE ON A
PURELY MUNICIPAL BASIS-IT IS THEREFORE RATIONAL AND EFFICIENT TO TRANSFER
THESE TO THE REGIONAL OR SUPRAMUNICIPAL-THAT IS, COUNTY-LEVEL.
PLANNING A WAGON LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE SR-6 STATE RAILWAY NETWORK, RIO
GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL.

A PROJECT PRESENTED TO THE BRAZILIAN RAILWAY BORAD IN 1980, BASED ON PREVIOUS
EXPERIENCE WITH MOBILE LIBRARIES. THE WAGON LIBRARY WOULD CIRCULATE THROUGHOUT
THE NETWORK HOOKED UP TO A PASSENGER TRAIN; THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS IN
PROMOTING READING ARE DISCUSSED, AND DETAILS GIVEN OF THE ESTIMATED STAFF,
STOCK, AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED. PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING AND CONTROLLING THE
SERVICE ARE OUTLINED, AND A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WHICH
COULD OPERATE FROM THE WAGON AS A BASE SUGGESTED.
INVISIBLE COLLEGES AS A BASIS FOR PLANNING SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES. A REVIEW
OF THE LITERATURE.

EXPLAINS HOW INVISIBLE COLLEGES FACILITATE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION AMONG
MEMBERS OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES, CITING PUBLISHED RESEARCH AS EVIDENCE.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE TO SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS HAVE
CAPITALISED ON THIS PHENOMENON. PROPOSES THAT INFORMATION CENTRES IDENTIFY THE
INTERESTS OF USER COMMUNITIES AND KEEP FILES ON THEIR ACTIVITIES,
DISSEMINATING THIS INFORMATION AS PART OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICES.
WHICH WAY FOR SCHOOL MEDIA SERVICES TO TURN?.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION IN RECENT YEARS ON THE
TRANSFER OF SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION OF
CUTBACKS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY FINANCES THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FOR SUCH A
TRANSFER. HOWEVER, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
AUTHORITIES, ARE AS MUCH A PART OF THE SCHOOL 'SUPPORT' STAFF AS EDUCATIONAL
PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ALSO FOUND IN SCHOOLS. LIBRARIANS EXPERIENCED
IN THE PROVISION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO
ORGANISE SCHOOL LIBRARIES WITH THEIR GROWING COLLECTIONS OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS AS WELL AS THEIR BOOKSTOCK.
LIBRARY NETWORK IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AND ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

THE RECENT COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE 7TH 5-YEAR-PLAN
(1981-85) HAVE GIVEN A NEW IMPETUS TO THE WHOLE LIBRARY NETWORK IN SLOVAKIA.
SINCE 1 JAN 82, A SPECIAL SECTION OF MATICA SLOVENSKA, BASED IN BRATISLAVA,
HAS BEEN IN OPERATION. ITS STAFF HAVE TO WATCH, DIRECT AND CONTROL BOTH SHORT-
AND LONG-TERM PLANNING IN LIBRARIES. THEY WILL ALSO CARE FOR COORDINATION
BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC
INFORMATION. CONTACTS WITH LIBRARIES IN THE CZECH SOCIALIST REPUBLIC AS WELL
AS INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS WILL ALSO BE FURTHERED. THE OVERALL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIBRARIES, HOWEVER, RESTS UPON THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF
CULTURE. FOR THEIR PART, THE MINISTRY'S OFFICIALS WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT
TOWARDS UNIFICATION AND/OR STANDARDISATION OF ALL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES,
INCLUDING BUILDING UP BOOK COLLECTIONS, RECORDS, STATISTICS AND THE LIKE.
AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH MUST BE TACKLED IN  THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE ARE
COMPUTERISATION, MERGERS OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, WHERE APPROPRIATE,
AND INCORPORATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO LOCAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS.
NETWORKS.

REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING ON REGIONAL LIBRARY
COOPERATION IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS COOPERATION AMONGST
LIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES HAS COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AS A RESULT OF THE
INCLUSION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC SERVICES ACT. THE
CONCEPT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS DATES FROM THE EARLY 1900S WHEN THE NEED FOR
LIBRARIES TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES WAS RECOGNISED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE LIBRARY
NETWORKS ARE THOSE NETWORKS WHICH OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ON A FINANCIAL BASIS.
IN ADDITION, THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION POLICIES, CATALOGUING SERVICES
AND INTERLIBRARY LENDING AMONGST MEMBERS OF A LIBRARY NETWORK REQUIRES THE
MOST UP-TO-DATE TELECOMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. WITHIN EACH NETWORK
A CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO ACT AS A CLEARING-HOUSE FOR THE
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.
EXTRA-MURAL FUNCTIONS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

FOR OVER 10 YEARS PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN BUYING MORE ACADEMIC LITERATURE
THAN BEFORE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OFFERING THE USE OF THEIR FACILITIES TO
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. THIS EXTRA-MURAL WORK MUST NOT BE REDUCED
BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS; THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR ACADEMIC MATERIAL MUST BE
SATISFIED AND INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND PURCHASING SCHEMES MUST RESULT IN A
BETTER COORDINATED AND MORE ECONOMICAL USE OF LITERATURE. THE BUILDING UP OF
UNION CATALOGUES USING ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING AND OF DECENTRALISED
MICROFICHE AND SCREEN TEXT SERVICES WILL EASE THE DEMAND ON UNIVERSITY SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS. ISOLATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WILL NOT IMPROVE THEIR PUBLIC
IMAGE AND COULD PROVE COSTLY.
THE WORK OF THE STUDY GROUP OF DIRECTORS OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

IN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM OF EAST GERMANY, THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OF BERLIN,
DRESDEN, GREIFSWALD, HALLE, JENA, LEIPZIG AND ROSTOCK PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART
IN INTER-LIBRARY LOAN SCHEMES AND IN THE ACQUISITION OF SPECIALISED STOCKS. IN
1980 THESE UNIVERSITIES OWNED TOTAL STOCKS OF 18 MILLION ITEMS. THE STUDY
GROUP PROVIDES ADVICE ON ORGANISATION, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF A CENTRAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WITH
ASSOCIATED BRANCHES AND PROMOTES EXCHANGES AND ANALYSES OF EXPERIENCE. THE
GROUP IS CURRENTLY CONCENTRATING ON INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION WITHIN SUBJECT
NETWORKS, WITH A VIEW TO IMRPOVING PURCHASING POLICY. IMPROVEMENTS MUST ALSO
BE MADE IN THE COOPERATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, INFORMATION CENTRES
AND RESEARCH, IN USER TRAINING AND IN THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY.
THE COLOMBIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY NETWORK.

A FULL PRESENTATION OF THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF THE COLOMBIAN
INTER-UNIVERSITY SYSTEM, SHOWING HOW IT WAS CREATED TO INTEGRATE EXISTING
INITIATIVES AND IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL INFORMATION POLICY OF COOPERATION AND
RESOURCE SHARING. THE NETWORK'S STRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMISE USE OF
AVAILABLE RESOURCES AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS; DETAILS ARE GIVEN
OF MEMBERSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION. 16 PROGRAMMES CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS ARE
OUTLINED; THESE INCLUDE PROJECTS FOR A NATIONAL UNION PERIODICALS CATALOGUE,
INTERLIBRARY LOAN, DUPLICATES EXCHANGE, COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING, CATALOGUING
IN PUBLICATION, PREPARATION OF DIRECTORIES AND GUIDES, AND TRAINING OF BOTH
PERSONNEL AND USERS.
INTERACTION WITHIN THE TECHNICAL REPORTS COMMUNITY.

THERE IS A GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG THE MAJOR US FEDERAL TECHNICAL
REPORTS PROCESSING AGENCIES, THE SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES/INFORMATION
CENTRES AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES WITH WHICH THEY INTERACT. IN THIS
INTERCONNECTED INFORMATION NETWORK, THE PARTICIPANTS BOTH FEED AND USE THE
SYSTEM TO FULFIL THEIR MISSIONS IN REGARD TO TRANSFERRING GOVERNMENT RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT RESULTS. COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS AND
SHARING OF RESOURCES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO LOWER
COSTS AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY. RECENT STEPS TAKEN TOWARDS THESE ARE DESCRIBED.
BACKGROUND TO THE COLOMBIAN LAW 11 OF 5 MARCH 1979 'RECOGNISING THE PROFESSION
OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND REGULATING ITS EXERCISE'.

DESCRIBES THE PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF EARLY VERSIONS OF THE COLOMBIAN
LAW NOW IN FORCE. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE PROJECTS PRESENTED IN 1963, 1964,
AND 1971, FOLLOWING DISCUSSION BY THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, TO REGULARISE
THE LEGAL BASIS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, TO ACCORD WITH ITS STATUS AS A UNIVERSITY
SUBJECT, AND EXPANDING RECRUITMENT. THE TEXT OF THE LAW IS APPENDED.
DRAFT OF A NEW LIBRARY BILL' AMPUTATED CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION AND MANY
POSSIBILITIES OF DISPENSATION.

THIS DRAFT, ISSUED BY THE DANISH MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS IN APR 81, TO
BECOME LAW AT THE EARLIEST JAN 83, OPERATES WITH A COMPLICATED CENTRAL
ADMINISTRATION, CONSISTING OF A CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR PRESIDING OVER A RESEARCH
LIBRARY AND A PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTORATE, EACH WITH A LIBRARY BOARD. SOME
LARGE RESEARCH LIBRARIES AT PRESENT UNDER A DIFFERENT MINISTRY FROM THE
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL CONTROL, ALTHOUGH GENERAL
DEVELOPMENT PLANNING FOR ALL RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS TO BE CENTRALLY
ADMINISTERED. THERE WILL BE NO DIRECT STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES IN GENERAL, BUT SOME SPECIFIED LIBRARIES AND ACTIVITIES WILL RECEIVE
STATE GRANTS. THE JOINT APPROPRIATION IS TO REMAIN AND WILL INCLUDE THE
PRESENT DISPENSATION FUND. DATES ARE SET FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL TIME
SERVICE AND OF MUSICAL MATERIAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
IN CONVERSATION WITH THE MINISTER FOR CULTURE, RECREATION AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS,
HANS DE BOER.

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH HANS DE BOER, MINISTER FOR CULTURE, RECREATION AND
SOCIAL AFFAIRS IN THE NETHERLANDS. DE BOER FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE NEW PUBLIC
SERVICES ACT WHICH WILL DECENTRALISE RUNNING OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. DE BOER BELIEVES
THAT INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES IS
THE BEST GUARANTEE FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE. PLANS FOR
EXTENDING THE AGE LIMIT FOR FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP FROM 16 TO 18 YEARS
OF AGE HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY DE BOER BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL CUTBACKS IN
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. THE ALTERNATIVE, DE BOER BELIEVES, WOULD HAVE BEEN A
REDUCTION IN THE STANDARD OF SERVICE.
ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM
(DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE)' THE CHAIRMAN'S TURN TO SPEAK
(PART) 2.

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. J.J. POSTMA, CHAIRMAN OF THE NBLC ON THE 10TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE. POSTMA BELIEVES THAT LIBRARIANS IN
THE NETHERLANDS SHOULD NOW COME TO TERMS WITH THE NEW PUBLIC SERVICES ACT,
WHICH WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT. BY REFUSING TO ACCEPT
THE ACT LIBRARIANS ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. IN POSTMA'S
VIEW THE DANGER OF THE NEW ACT LIES IN THE DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING PUBLIC LIBRARIES, FROM NATIONAL TO LOCAL
GOVERNMENT. IN SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES, HE ADDS, TOWN FESTIVALS MAY RECEIVE
GREATER PRIORITY THAN THE LIBRARY SERVICE. THE NBLC MUST CONVINCE THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE NEED FOR AN INFORMATION ACT WHICH INCLUDES THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE. (FOR AN ABSTRACT OF PART 1, 2SEE1 82/5007).
LIBRARY-INFORMATION SERVICE EVALUATION' A CASE-HISTORY FROM PHARMACEUTICAL R
AND D.

DESCRIBES A 19-WEEK PROJECT TO EXAMINE AND EVALUATE THE LIBRARY-INFORMATION
SERVICE AT SYNTEX RESEARCH CENTRE, RICCARTON, EDINBURGH, A PHARMACEUTICAL R
AND D CENTRE. AREAS LOOKED AT WERE' STOCK-USE RECORDS; INTERLOAN REQUESTS; USE
OF LIBRARY STAFF TIME AND THE CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETIN. 36 LIBRARY USERS,
RESEARCH SCIENTISTS, WERE INTERVIEWED, AND THEIR DEMAND FOR INFORMATION
SERVICES IS DESCRIBED. DISCUSSES THE VALIDITY OF INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARY-INFORMATION SERVICE EVALUATION TESTS AND PROBLEMS AND ATTRACTIONS OF
EVALUATING A COMPLETE LIBRARY-INFORMATION SERVICE 'IN THE ROUND'.
STUDIES IN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT VOLUME SEVEN.

COLLECTED PAPERS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT DIVIDED INTO 3 MAIN
SECTIONS' (1) INCLUDES A NUMBER OF MAJOR TOPICS, AUTHORITATIVELY TREATED; (2)
INCLUDES STUDIES OF THE 'VALUE' OF LIBRARIES, AND OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IN
LIBRARIES; AND (3) PRESENTS MORE SPECIALISED STUDIES OF INTEREST TO LIBRARIANS
AND LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENTS.
MANAGING MULTISITE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY SERVICES.

OUTLINES MANAGERIAL PROBLEMS COMMON TO MULTISITE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN
THESE TIMES OF ECONOMIC STRINGENCY. DISCUSSES' STYLES OF MANAGEMENT;
ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES; RATIONALISATION OF SYSTEMS; STAFF ALLOCATION;
MANAGEMENT OF GROWTH; STAFF DEVELOPMENT; AND COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS.
DISCUSSION AND COMMUNICATION FOR STAFF IN THE HOOGEVEEN PUBLIC LIBRARY.

IN 1971 A SCHEME OF WORKER PARTICIPATION WAS INTRODUCED AT HOOGEVEEN PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS. PREVIOUSLY STAFF MEETINGS WERE RESTRICTED TO
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ONLY. UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM WEEKLY MEETINGS WERE HELD AT
WHICH THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN AND HEADS OF THE ADULT AND CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS
WERE PRESENT. REPORTS OF THESE MEETINGS WERE CIRCULATED TO ALL HEADS OF
DEPARTMENTS. IN 1975 FOLLOWING THE OPENING OF A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY THE
LIBRARY SERVICE WAS REORGANISED INTO 8 DEPARTMENTS AND A NEW STRUCTURE OF
STAFF MEETINGS WAS INTRODUCED. IN ADDITION TO THE MEETINGS ATTENDED BY
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS, ALL STAFF OF THE INTERNAL
SERVICES MEET EVERY 3 WEEKS, WHILE STAFF OF THE EXTERNAL SERVICES MEET EACH
WEEK. THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEETINGS IS TO IMPROVE STAFF MOTIVATION AND THEREBY
THE QUALITY OF THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES.
CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION' ONE POINT OF VIEW.

EXAMINES THE DEBATE ON CENTRALISATION AND DECENTRALISATION IN RELATION TO' THE
HISTORICAL ASPECTS, SHOWING HOW IN GENERAL THE LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
SYSTEM AT PRESENT DEVELOPED FROM THE ORIGINAL EUROPEAN PATTERN; THE
INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS, WHERE THE NECESSITY FOR UNIVERSITIES TO FULFIL THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES DICTATES ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES, IN TURN GOVERNING LIBRARY
ORGANISATION; THE TECHNICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, OUTLINING THE ESSENTIAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF CENTRALISED, PARTIALLY DECENTRALISED, AND DECENTRALISED
SYSTEMS; AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS. THIS SURVEY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE SHOULD DETERMINE
ADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES.
THE METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SERVICES OF THE MINISTRY FOR UNIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE
AFFAIRS.

THE CENTRE ASSISTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CENTRAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES AND SUBJECT
NETWORKS AND PROMOTES THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES AND
INFORMATION CENTRES IN EAST GERMANY. GIVES ESTIMATES AND OPINIONS ON
INVESTMENT PROJECTS, DRAFT VERSIONS OF NEW REGULATIONS, ORGANISATIONAL
GUIDELINES; STANDARDS AND STATISTICS ARE ALSO PRODUCED. THE MAIN CURRENT
RESEARCH PROJECTS INCLUDE' A CLASSIFICATION FOR SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES; THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING FOR
USE IN LOAN SYSTEMS, CATALOGUING AND INFORMATION SERVICES; THE EXPANSION OF
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION WORK IN UNIVERSITIES; THE USE OF FOREIGN
MAGNETIC TAPE SERVICES. THE CENTRE REPRESENTS EAST GERMANY IN THE WORK OF THE
INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION IN MOSCOW.
ADVISORY BODIES IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.

ADVISORY BODIES AND COMMITTEES DEALING WITH LIBRARIANSHIP IN SLOVAKIA ARE
LISTED. AMONG THE PROBLEMS TACKLED ARE NOT ONLY CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND
PRESERVATION OF BOOK COLLECTIONS, BUT ALSO STANDARDISATION, RESEARCH AND
STATISTICS IN LIBRARIES, AS WELL AS CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS.
SPECIAL COMMITTEES ATTEND TO THE RUNNING OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
ALSO TO LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS HEADED BY THE
SLOVAK LIBRARY COUNCIL ESTABLISHED IN THE 1950S. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE
COUNCIL'S ANNUAL PLANS IS TO MEET THE TARGETS SET BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF
CULTURE. FOLLOWING A CAREFUL AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION IN THE COURSE OF THE
CURRENT 5 YEAR PLAN (1981-85), MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE UNIFICATION OF
ALL ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AND TO INCREASE THEIR IMPACT ON LIBRARIES.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARY WORK AMONG ADULTS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN. A
COUNTRY WITH A RICH PUBLICATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE SHOULD ALSO HAVE
WELL-APPOINTED AND FLOURISHING CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES. CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES HAVE
EXISTED IN SWEDEN FOR 70 YEARS, BUT NOT UNTIL THE 1970S, WITH GREAT
EDUCATIONAL REFORMS, WAS PRIORITY ACCORDED TO LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN.
FROM THE LATE 1970S, LIBRARY CONSULTANTS' POSTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT
ALMOST ALL THE COUNTY LIBRARIES. DESCRIBES THE CONSULTANT'S ROLE IN RELATION
TO THAT OF OTHERS CONCERNED WITH CHILD WELFARE.
ZZZZ.

IN BOTH NORWAY AND SWEDEN, COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO LOOK INTO THE
FINANCING OF SERVICES IN PUBLICLY FUNDED UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES.

ALL LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD BE FREE OF CHARGE.

IN THE BILL FOR A NEW DANISH LIBRARY ACT, WHICH WILL SHORTLY BE TABLED IN THE
FOLKETING, THE CLAUSE REGARDING A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE WILL, IT SEEMS, BE
RETAINED. QUESTIONS WHETHER THE PARTIES WHO BELIEVE THAT A CHARGE SHOULD BE
LEVIED FOR LIBRARY USE WILL MANAGE TO INFLUENCE THE FINAL FORM OF THE ACT. IF
THE PRINCIPLE OF A FREE SERVICE GOES BY THE BOARD, EVERY IDEA OF AN EQUAL
SERVICE TO ALL WILL GO BY THE BOARD WITH IT, WITH THE CONSEQUENT BAD EFFECT ON
PUBLISHING HOUSES, BOOKSHOPS AND AUTHORS.
FAIR PLAY WITH THE CAKE, YOU KNOW?'.D

ISCUSSES THE ECONOMIC CUTS AS THEY AFFECT THE LIBRARY SERVICES. THE
GOVERNMENT'S SAVINGS CIRCULAR RECOMMENDED THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CUT LIBRARY
EXPENDITURE TO 185 KR PER CAPITA, AS, IT WAS ARGUED, PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOWED
SIGNS OF UNCONTROLLED GROWTH. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS, HOWEVER, CALCULATED
PUBLIC LIBRARIES' REAL GROWTH IN 1980 AS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDED
3%; THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE. THE FIGURES FOR 1981
INDICATE AN AVERAGE FALL IN REAL GROWTH OF 1.4%. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS
EXAMINED THE LOCAL EFFECTS OF CUTS AND FOUND THAT FRINGE SERVICES LIKE
OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE WORST HIT AND THAT STAFF APPOINTMENTS ARE FROZEN. THE
GOVERNMENT'S TECHNOCRATS HAVE DRAWN UP MODELS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PUBLIC SECTOR, BUT LIBRARIANS' ANSWER MUST BE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
LIBRARY PART OF THIS SECTOR IS NOT A TECHNICAL MATTER ONLY, BUT THAT CULTURAL
ASPECTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.
GANGS OF SAVERS IN A DANCE OF CRANES.

4 MEMBERS OF THE LIBRARIANS' UNION'S WORKING PARTY ON SAVINGS WERE ASKED TO
EVALUATE THE LIBRARY SITUATION IN VIEW OF THE CUTS IN EXPENDITURE. THEY
DISCUSSED THE FIGURES RELATING TO RUNNING COSTS, STAFF AND MATERIAL COSTS
PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE AND THE EFFECTS OF CUTS ON WORK LOADS AND
LOANS. VIEWS DIFFERED AS TO WHETHER MINIMUM NORMS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN. THEY
AGREED THAT THE UNION AS A CENTRAL ORGANISATION COULD DO LITTLE TO GIVE
GUIDELINES FOR ACTION IN LOCAL SITUATIONS. SOME THOUGHT MEMBERS SHOULD REFUSE
TO TAKE PART IN LOCAL WORKING GROUPS ON SAVINGS SET UP TO GIVE PRIORITIES TO
CUTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS, AS THIS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO CONDONING CUTS, OTHERS
THOUGHT USEFUL INFORMATION COULD BE GAINED FROM PARTICIPATION AND THAT LOCAL
LIBRARIANS SHOULD PRESENT POLITICANS WITH WELL ARGUED BUDGET PROPOSALS AND
OUTLINE EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR CUTS.
CABLE LIBRARY SURVEY RESULTS.

PUBLIC SERVICE SATELLITE CONSORTIUM CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES,
IN 1980, TO STUDY THEIR DATA COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS AND SERVICES. 'CABLE
LIBRARIES' (CATVLIB) WERE IDENTIFIED AS LIBRARIES CONNECTED TO LOCAL CABLE
COMPANIES. A 2ND STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT A NATIONAL SATELLITE
CABLE LIBRARY NETWORK MIGHT ALREADY BE IN TECHNICAL EXISTENCE; HOW MANY
LIBRARIES ARE PRESENTLY CONNECTED TO COOPERATIVE CABLE COMPANIES WITH
SATELLITE HARDWARE AND EXCESS SATELLITE RECEIVER CAPACITY AND OF THAT NUMBER,
HOW MANY CABLE LIBRARIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN
SATELLITE-ASSISTED LIBRARY SERVICES AND TELECONFERENCING.
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND THE LIBRARY' AN INTRODUCTION.

A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE VARIOUS FORMS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION, DESCRIBING
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, MODES OF COMPUTER OPERATION (INCLUDING ON-LINE AND
BATCH PROCESSING), NETWORKS, AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.
AUTOMATION: A CHALLENGE TO THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE LIBRARY AND THE SOCIAL
CHARACTER OF THE STAFF?.

DISCUSSES THE IDEAS OF COBABUS AND THIEM ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
AUTOMATION AND' (1) PRODUCTIVITY; (2) PRODUCT QUALITY; (3) STAFF
QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING, AND THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON
EXPENDITURE UPON THESE RELATIONSHIPS. AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES TENDS TO LAG
BEHIND AUTOMATION IN OTHER FIELDS BUT IT DEMANDS CHANGES IN STAFF TRAINING,
INTELLECTUALISATION OF PRODUCTION WORK AND A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC
AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. PROCESSES PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED CAN BE INTEGRATED BY
AUTOMATION. BEFORE AUTOMATION THERE WAS A TENDENCY TOWARDS RIGIDITY IN THE
HIGHER STAFF GRADES; NOW AUTOMATION REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE STAFF HIERARCHY
AND THE OLD IDEA OF THE 'CLASSICAL LIBRARIAN'.
THE REITERATE ON THE AUTOMATION OF LIBRARIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, THIS TIME
INCLUDING SOME PRACTICAL RESULTS.

AN ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT SITUATION IN LIBRARY
AUTOMATION IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA ARE PRESENTED, INCLUDING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF
MAJOR TRENDS. DATA ON 14 LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE ATTAINED CERTAIN PRACTICAL
RESULTS IN USING COMPUTERS TO ASSIST THEM IN SPECIFIC LIBRARY OPERATIONS AND
PROCESSES ARE SET OUT IN THE TABLE.
IS AUTOMATION NECESSARY?.

IN THE NETHERLANDS SUPPORTERS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN
LIBRARY SERVICE POINT TO THE COMPUTERISED LOANS SYSTEMS ALREADY IN OPERATION
IN LIBRARIES IN ROTTERDAM, AMSTERDAM AND ELSEWHERE, AND TO THE GROWING NUMBER
OF LIBRARIES MAKING USE OF COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING NETWORKS. OPPONENTS OF
AUTOMATION POINT TO THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE REPLACEMENT OF MAN BY
MACHINES. A FURTHER GROUP SUGGESTS THAT THE USE OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE WORK TO BE DONE AND ASSERTS THAT CERTAIN
TECHNICAL AIDS, SUCH AS THE TELEPHONE AND THE PHOTOCOPIER, ARE REGARDED AS
ESSENTIAL TO A LIBRARY'S SERVICES. IN SPITE OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS BECOMING
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN STAFF FOR CERTAIN TASKS IN
LIBRARIES. IN SUCH CASES AUTOMATION CAN BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE.
STATE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE USSR. AUTOMATION OF
LIBRARY PROCEDURE AS A MEANS OF RAISING EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARIES.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE OF COOPERATIVE LIBRARIANS & DOCUMENTATION
OFFICERS, MOSCOW, OCT 80. SINCE 1976 AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM HAS BEEN UNDER
DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE USSR,
COVERING ALL BASIC LIBRARY PROCEDURES, FROM ACQUISITIONS TO SUBSCRIBER
SERVICES. IT IS ALSO PLANNED TO AUTOMATE THE MAINTENANCE OF A CARD INDEX OF
READERS, AND CARD INDEXES OF PARTICULAR REFERENCE SOLUTIONS. IT IS FELT THAT
THE AUTOMATION WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE LIBRARY'S EFFICIENCY.
THE NETWORKING OF WEST VIRGINIA' A WORKSHOP SUMMARY.

REPORT ON 2 WEST VIRGINIA NETWORKING WORKSHOPS HELD IN JULY AND AUG 80. THE
HIGHLIGHT OF BOTH MEETINGS WAS A PRESENTATION BY VINOD CHACHRA OF VIRGINIA
POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY, WHO HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE
STATE OF THE ART OF LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN WEST VIRGINIA. THE
PRESENTATION IS SUMMARISED IN SOME DETAIL.
ISSUES AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOMPUTERS FOR LIBRARIES.

ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, JUNE 81. EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF MICROCOMPUTERS
ON LIBRARIES, AND ARGUES THAT THEIR INTRODUCTION REPRESENTS A CRITICAL POINT
FOR INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS. DISCUSSES THE APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOMPUTERS AS
PART OF A REFERENCE SERVICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS,
AND FOR EXTERNAL ON-LINE ACCESS.
THE AGE OF MICRO-INFORMATICS.

A SURVEY DISCUSSING THE USES OF MICROPROCESSORS IN GENERAL. A BRIEF
EXPLANATION IS GIVEN OF HOW MICROPROCESSORS WORK AND COSTS INVOLVED ESTIMATED.
THEN THE 2 MAIN TENDENCIES GOVERNING USE OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE EXAMINED'
DECENTRALISATION, AS IN THE USA; AND CENTRALISED COLLECTIVE SYSTEMS AS IN
FRANCE AND THE UK. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN ILLUSTRATING VARIOUS APPLICATIONS IN
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. SURVEYS PRESENT USES OF MICROPROCESSORS IN PERFORMING
TRADITIONAL AND INNOVATORY INFORMATION TASKS, AND PROVIDING SPECIALISED
COMMUNICATION SERVICES. IN CONCLUSION CONSIDERS BRIEFLY FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN
DATA BASE MANAGEMENT, SELF-EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATIONS.
MINICOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES, 1981-82' THE ERA OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS.

ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS POSED BY READERS OF THE EARLIER
BOOK, 2MINICOMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES1 1979-1980. A SECTION DEVOTED TO THE PROCESS
OF SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIES IS FOLLOWED BY 1 DESCRIBING HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING. A 3RD SECTION GIVES LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS. A LARGE DIRECTORY OF INSTALLED SYSTEMS IS
INCLUDED.
MICRO-INFORMATICS AND LIBRARY SCIENCE.

A BRIEF SURVEY DESCRIBING HOW LIBRARIES CAN CAPITALISE ON THE OPPORTUNITIES
OFFERED BY THE AVAILABILITY AT LOW COST OF MICROCOMPUTERS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN
OF HOW MICROCOMPUTERS WORK AND THEIR POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN LIBRARY
SITUATIONS; PROGRAMS FOR MANAGING LOANS, ACQUISITIONS, AND PERIODICAL
COLLECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED; AND THE ADVANTAGES OF ACCESSING ON-LINE DATA BASES
CONSIDERED.
LEARNING BY MICROCOMPUTER' THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY.

EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE MICROCOMPUTER IN THE LIBRARY OF A COLLEGE OF
EDUCATION LIBRARY, WITH REFERENCE TO THE EXPERIENCES OF THE AUTHOR WITH THE
COMPUTER IN THE LIBRARY OF STRANMILLIS COLLEGE, BELFAST. DISCUSSES' REASONS
FOR INSTALLING A COMPUTER IN A LIBRARY; CHOOSING A SUITABLE COMPUTER; ITS
OPERATION AND PROGRAMING; DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING
PROGRAMS; AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL PROGRAMS. GIVES SOME INFORMATION ON
VARIOUS PRODUCERS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR MICROCOMPUTERS, AND NOTES THE
STEPS WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARDS IMPROVING THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF
THIS SOFTWARE.
QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED OF STAFF MEMBERS AT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY WORK. GIVES A SHORT HISTORICAL REVIEW OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS
REQUIRED OF APPLICANTS TO QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS' POSTS IN SWEDISH ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES. SHOWS HOW NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AS WELL AS IN
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES HAVE AFFECTED CONDITIONS OF WORK IN A LIBRARY. NEW TASKS
HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TRADITIONAL ONES, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND WAYS OF
RECONCILING THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WITH EXISTING LIBRARY EXPERTISE, AND TO FIND A
COMMON DOMINATOR WHICH WILL WORK TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ALL TASKS IN A
LIBRARY. THIS IS FOUND IN THE OVERALL AIMS FOR LIBRARY WORK' TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF THE CUSTOMER. INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING ON HOW BEST TO MEET THE USERS' NEEDS
SHOULD THEREFORE FORM AN IMPORTANT PART OF ALL EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP.
STAFFING IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES A STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS
IN NIGERIA SATISFY THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF
SCHOLARSHIP AND RESEARCH, AND WHETHER THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS IN WHICH
STAFF WORK ARE CONDUCIVE TO EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE. AMONG MAJOR
ELEMENTS EXAMINED WERE THE LIBRARIANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES;
THEIR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS; WORK ENVIRONMENTS; JOB
SATISFACTION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL
DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE HAS BEEN HINDERED
BY THE INABILITY OF THE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TO CONCEPTUALISE THE PROPER
ROLE OF A LIBRARIAN; RIGID BUREAUCRATISATION IN THE LIBRARIES; FAILURE TO
SEPARATE PROFESSIONAL FROM NON-PROFESSIONAL DUTIES; AND BY LIMITED INCENTIVES
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH.
TRAINING JUNIOR STAFF IN A MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. SHORTAGE OF SENIOR STAFF AT THE RADCLIFFE SCIENCE LIBRARY, OXFORD
UNIVERSITY (UK) HAS NECESSITATED THE TRAINING OF JUNIOR STAFF IN THE BASIC
PRINCIPLES OF ASSISTING READERS. THE METHODS USED ARE RELATED TO THE
LITERATURE STOCK, CATALOGUES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC SOURCES, AND REFERENCE WORKS IN
THE LIBRARY. THE PLAN OF LECTURES IN THE 18-HOUR TRAINING COURSE IS OUTLINED
AND SOME ELEMENTS DESCRIBED. THE COURSE EFFECTIVENESS TESTS ARE OUTLINED.
INTRA-REGIONAL COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION WORKSHOP.

ON 6 MAY 81, AN IN-SERVICE TRAINING DAY WAS HELD FOR STAFF MEMBERS AND
VOLUNTEERS WORKING WITHIN THE MIRACLE VALLEY REGIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEM, WEST
VIRGINIA. ITS PURPOSE WAS TWOFOLD' (1) TO ACQUAINT STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS IN
ORDER TO PROMOTE BETTER INTRA-REGIONAL COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION; AND (2)
TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL WORKSHOP EXPERIENCE FOR NON-PROFESSIONAL STAFF. THE
KEYNOTE ADDRESS AND PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE WORKSHOP ARE SUMMARISED. THE DAY
WAS SO SUCCESSFUL, IT IS HOPED TO MAKE THE WORKSHOP AN ANNUAL EVENT.

HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR BOARD MEMBERS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF
THEIR PROVINCES'S LABOUR CODE, AND FOR CHIEF LIBRARIANS AND THEIR ASSISTANTS
TO BE WELL TRAINED IN CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION. ALSO CONSIDERS BARGAINING AND
NEGOTIATING TACTICS.
UNION-LIBRARY RELATIONSHIP.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, JUNE 81. EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF UNIONS ON
CANADIAN LIBRARIES, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF LIBRARY STAFF
ORGANISATIONS IN ANGLOPHONE CANADA. DISCUSSES HOW LIBRARY MANAGERS CAN TRY TO
ENSURE THAT THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE LIBRARY REMAINS AS UNIMPAIRED AS
POSSIBLE AFTER UNIONISATION. ARGUES THAT THE SERVICE FUNCTION IS THE ASPECT OF
LIBRARY OPERATIONS MOST ENDANGERED BY THE IMPACT OF UNIONS, AND URGES THOSE
RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE SERVICE GOAL OF LIBRARIES REMAINS AS UNFETTERED
AS POSSIBLE BY A COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT.
THE CURRENT STATE OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS.

IN RECENT YEARS TRAINING FOR THE HIGHER STAFF GRADES HAS UNDERGONE A
FUNDAMENTAL REFORM. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES WORKING IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES HAS NOW INCREASED. FORMERLY, ALTHOUGH ALL STAFF IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES POSSESSED UNIVERSITY DEGREES, FEW OF THEM POSSESSED QUALIFICATIONS
IN LIBRARIANSHIP. IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY CONTRAST, MOST SENIOR STAFF HAVE
LIBRARIANSHIP QUALIFICATIONS. THE NEW SITUATION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY LEGAL
CHANGES, THE FINAL RESULTS OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. AT
PRESENT THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF COURSES AVAILABLE; THE BEST BALANCE OF
THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TRAINING MUST BE CHOSEN. FURTHER CONSIDERATION MUST
BE GIVEN TO THE JOINT TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS AND TO THE
SALARIES OF LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF.
THE STATUS OF LIBRARIANS IN HONG KONG.

DISCUSSES THE STATUS, SALARIES AND QUALIFICATIONS OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN
ACADEMIC, PUBLIC, SPECIAL AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN HONG KONG. OUTLINES REASONS
FOR A LACK OF MILITANCY AMONGST ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, IN A WEAKER POSITION WITHOUT
POST-GRADUATE QUALIFICATIONS, HAVE FORMED THE ASSOCIATION OF ASSISTANT
LIBRARIANS TO PROTECT AND FURTHER THEIR INTERESTS. DESCRIBES THE DIPLOMA
COURSE IN LIBRARIANSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY INTRODUCED AND IS AIMED AT
ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND A TRAINING COURSE FOR
TEACHER-LIBRARIANS. CONCLUDES WITH THE ROLE OF THE HONG KONG LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION IN PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF ITS MEMBERS.
THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION AND ASSOCIATION CREDIBILITY.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. NLA WAS
FOUNDED IN 1975 TO MEET A LONG-FELT NEED IN MANY LIBRARIANS FOR A NATIONAL
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION WHICH WOULD CONCERN ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY WITH LIBRARIAN
ISSUES RATHER THAN WITH THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF ISSUES RELATED TO LIBRARIES IN
SOCIETY. NLA IS SMALL, NEW AND NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE USA HAS 100,000
LIBRARIANS, BUT NLA HAS ONLY 500 MEMBERS. NO LIBRARY PUBLICATION HAS REPORTED
ON OR EVALUATED NLA'S POSITION PAPERS ON A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM OF CERTIFICATION
FOR LIBRARIANS AND ON PROFESSIONAL WELFARE. LIBRARY SCHOOLS TEND TO IGNORE
NLA'S OFFERS TO PROVIDE SPEAKERS OR INFORMATION MATERIALS. IN MANY WAYS NLA
HAS ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL, BUT IT STANDS AT A CRITICAL POINT IN ITS
DEVELOPMENT. IT MAY BE THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSING 'BREAD AND BUTTER' ISSUES WILL
PROVIDE THE IMPETUS NLA NEEDS TO REGAIN ITS MOVEMENT TOWARD BECOMING A MAJOR
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR LIBRARIA NS.
A NEW CONCEPT OF FURTHER TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE SCHEME, WHOSE TEXT IS INCLUDED, WAS DEVISED BY DAS ZENTRALINSTITUT FUR
BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IN 1981. GENERAL
TRAINING ON CULTURAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS IS PROVIDED TOGETHER WITH VARIOUS
TYPES OF SPECIALIST MATERIAL AND INFORMATION FOR MANAGEMENT. THE COURSE
INCLUDES LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS AND VISITS TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT LIBRARIES; USE
IS MADE OF FACILITIES IN LARGE CENTRAL ORGANISATIONS AND IN SMALL BRANCH
LIBRARIES. THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM TRAINING COURSES ALREADY AVAILABLE IN
POTSDAM AND ERFURT HAS PROVED VALUABLE. ALL PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN MUNICIPAL
AND RURAL LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY WILL HAVE A REGULAR TRAINING PROGRAMME; IN
SOME AREAS A TRAINING CENTRE HAS BEEN CREATED TO SERVE SEVERAL LIBRARIES.
IN-SERVICE QUALIFICATION AT THE WAB(B) POTSDAM.

IN MANY LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES THERE ARE UNQUALIFIED STAFF IN SPECIALIST
POSTS WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO STUDY FOR PROFESSIONAL
QUALIFICATIONS. SINCE 1979 POTSDAM RESEARCH LIBRARY HAS ORGANISED SPECIAL
IN-SERVICE TRAINING COURSES FOR THEM, INCLUDING GENERAL SURVEYS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR AND SPECIALIST TRAINING IN
THE WORK OF THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS. AT THE END OF THE 12 MONTHS' COURSE EACH
STUDENT RECEIVES A CERTIFICATE OF PARTICIPATION. IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR STAFF TO
HAVE PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TO GIVE THEM
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURSE AND TO GET FROM THEM A PROMISE TO WORK HARD.
EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT MOST STUDENTS FIND THE COURSE HELPFUL. THIS TYPE OF
COURSE CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED IN A LARGE LIBRARY SYSTEM.
WOMEN IN LIBRARIES' A SPECIAL ISSUE.

SPECIAL ISSUE DEVOTED TO PROBLEMS FACED BY WOMEN EMPLOYED IN LIBRARIES.

THE REMOVAL AND EQUIPPING OF AN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.

THE LIBRARY OF THE DE VOORST HYDRAULICS LABORATORY IN THE NOORDOOSTPOLDER IN
THE NETHERLANDS BEGAN WITH A SMALL COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTS IN 1963. BY 1980
THE LIBRARY CONTAINED OVER 20,000 DOCUMENTS, ANNUAL LOANS TOTALLED ALMOST
10,000 AND THE COLLECTION HAD LONG OUTGROWN THE ORIGINAL LIBRARY BUILDING. IN
1975 PLANS HAD ALREADY BEEN DRAWN UP FOR A NEW LIBRARY WITH A WORKING AREA OF
200 SQ.M. TOGETHER WITH A FURTHER 200 SQ.M. OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE AREA FOR
ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. THE PUBLIC, STAFF AND BOOKSTACK AREAS WERE PLANNED TO
PROVIDE THE MOST EFFICIENT LAYOUT FOR READERS AND STAFF AND REMOVAL OF THE
COLLECTION TO THE NEW LIBRARY WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED IN ADVANCE TO MINIMISE
DISRUPTION TO THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES.
IFLA AND LIBER SEMINARS ON LIBRARY BUILDINGS.

REPORT OF 2 SEMINARS ON LIBRARY BUILDINGS. THE 1ST, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN
DENMARK, WAS ORGANISED BY IFLA AND TOOK AS ITS THEME LIBRARY INTERIORS; THE
2ND, ORGANISED BY LIBER WAS HELD IN HEIDELBERG IN NOV 80, AND WAS ENTITLED
'NEW PROBLEMS IN LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE'. PAPERS AND DISCUSSION ARE REVIEWED.
HENRY THOMAS HARE 1860-1921. AN EDWARDIAN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARCHITECT AND HIS
WORK.

(M.A. THESIS). HENRY THOMAS HARE WAS A SUCCESSFUL COMPETITION ARCHITECT,
INITIALLY FOR MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS BUT LATER FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. AN ACCOUNT
IS GIVEN OF THE SOCIAL, PUBLIC LIBRARY AND ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY OF THE PERIOD
FOLLOWED BY AN OUTLINE OF HARE'S CAREER AS AN ARCHITECT WITH AN EXAMINATION OF
HIS VIEWS ON THE PLANNING AND DESIGN OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS. PARTICULAR
ATTENTION IS PAID TO HIS 'LARGE HALL OR ROOM' CONCEPT WHICH POINTED THE WAY TO
OPEN PLAN LIBRARIES.
FOUR NEW PUBLIC SWEDISH LIBRARIES-PRESENTATION AND COMMENTS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
INTRODUCTION TO 4 NEW SWEDISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AT NORA, SJOBO, VARBERG AND
OREBRO, GIVING DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS, FLOOR-PLANS AND DETAILS OF ORGANISATION.
SECTIONS ARE INCLUDED ON THE LIBRARY IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND ON THE BOOK
ROOM OF EACH OF THE 4 LIBRARIES.
FROM BARRACKS TO CULTURAL PALACE.

A LIGHT-HEARTED DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKING OF THE NEW REGIONAL LIBRARY WHICH
OPENED IN JAN 80 IN FROLUNDA CULTURAL CENTRE, GOTEBORG. APART FROM THE LIBRARY
OF 2750 SQ.M., THE 15,000 SQ.M. LARGE BUILDING CONTAINS SECONDARY SCHOOL,
SPORTSHALL, SWIMMING POOL, CAFETERIA, EXHIBITION HALL AND HALL FOR THEATRE AND
CINEMA. THE MOVE TO THE NEW LIBRARY SAW AN INCREASE OF LOANS OF 50%, THE STOCK
IS NOW 120,000 VOLUMES, 600 PERIODICALS AND 65 NEWSPAPERS. BUMS TERMINALS HAVE
BEEN INSTALLED. IN STEP WITH INCREASED RESOURCES THE READERS' USE OF REFERENCE
SERVICES HAS INCREASED, AND VISITS TO THE LIBRARY ARE PAID BY MANY DIFFERENT
GROUPS. PROGRAMMES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS HAVE EXPANDED.
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT AND THE LIBRARIAN.

EXAMINES THE RESPECTIVES ROLES OF THE ARCHITECT AND THE LIBRARIAN IN THE
PLANNING OF A LIBRARY BUILDING. CONCLUDES THAT, WHATEVER DESIGN A LIBRARY IS
TO TAKE, EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARIAN AND THE ARCHITECT IS AN
ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR GREATER SUCCESS AND MORE POSITIVE RESULTS.
ENERGY CONSERVATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS.

AT A TIME OF RAPIDLY RISING ENERGY COSTS ENERGY-CONSCIOUSNESS HAS BECOME A
NECESSITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS. AT MIERLO IN THE
NETHERLANDS A NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN NOV 81. BY THE INSERTION OF
EXTRA INSULATION IN THE FLOOR, WALLS AND ROOF, AND THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF
HEAT GENERATED BY THE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING IT IS EXPECTED THAT HEATING COSTS
FOR THE LIBRARY WILL BE 1/3 OF THE NORMAL AMOUNT FOR BUILDINGS OF SIMILAR
DIMENSIONS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF PREFABRICATED PARTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE LIBRARY ENABLED THE BUILDING TO BE COMPLETED IN 22 WEEKS WITH A CONSEQUENT
SAVING IN LABOUR COSTS.
AN ENERGY-CONSCIOUS LIBRARY BUILDING IN KATWIJK.

ON 14 DEC 80, A NEW BRANCH LIBRARY WAS OPENED AT KATWIJK IN THE NETHERLANDS.
DURING THE PLANNING STAGES IT WAS FELT THAT A BUILDING WITH A PUBLIC FUNCTION,
SUCH AS A PUBLIC LIBRARY, SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE IN ENERGY SAVING. TO MAXIMISE
NATURAL ENERGY FROM THE SUN THE BUILDING HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A LARGE
AREA OF GLASS IN THE SOUTH-EAST WALL; THE WARMTH GENERATED BY THIS MEANS IS
RETAINED IN THE STONE NORTH WALL AND THE FLOOR. THE BUILDING IS EQUIPPED WITH
TRIPLE-GLAZING AND HEAT-INSULATING BLINDS WHICH CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY AT NIGHT
AND REOPEN EACH MORNING. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SAVINGS IN ENERGY COSTS WILL
BE IN THE REGION OF 50%. IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS WILL FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE.
POINTS TO THE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE PHYSICAL DESIGN OF A LIBRARY.

A BRIEF SURVEY COVERING POINTS THAT MIGHT BE OVERLOOKED IN DESIGNING A
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. BASIC REQUIREMENTS TO BE CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE NEED FOR
FLEXIBILITY OF INTERIOR SPACE TO ALLOW FOR INCREASE OF READERS AND SERVICES,
AND THE CREATION OF AN AGREEABLE ATMOSPHERE. A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS, BY THE
LIBRARIAN AND ARCHITECT IN COLLABORATION, OF ACTIVITIES TO BE ACCOMMODATED
PERMITS CLASSIFICATION OF THE SPACE AVAILABLE IN RELATION TO REQUIREMENTS, FOR
EXAMPLE, FOR BOOKS, READERS, ADMINISTRATION, AND ARCHIVES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN
OF PROCEDURES FOR PLANNING INCORPORATION OF ESSENTIALS SUCH AS SHELVING SPACE,
READER ACCOMMODATION, ILLUMINATION, SOUND INSULATION, COMMUNICATION CHANNELS,
CLEANING SERVICES, AND PROVISION OF EQUIPMENT.
WHY GO TO DENMARK?.

EDITED TEXT OF A PAPER GIVEN TO THE JOINT CONFERENCE (OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND BRANCH OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION), BLARNEY, COUNTY CORK, MAY 80. DESCRIBES THE TOUR OF DANISH
LIBRARIES WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN IN 1979 BY A GROUP OF LIBRARIANS, ARCHITECTS
AND COUNTY MANAGERS FROM THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. THE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF THE
TOUR WAS TO SEE A RANGE OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS, VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT WHICH
MIGHT PROVIDE INSPIRATION FOR FUTURE IRISH LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, AND THE
JUTLAND AREA OF DENMARK WAS CHOSEN AS IT SEEMED TO REPRESENT THE MOST SUITABLE
EXAMPLE FOR IRISH NEEDS. GIVES BRIEF DETAILS OF THE LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE
MUNICIPALITIES OF AARHUS, RANDERS AND HABRO, AND DISCUSSES' DANISH LIBRARY
LAW; LIBRARY BUILDINGS; STAFFING; AND BOOK SELECTION.
ATTRACTION OF NEW READERS BY CENTRAL REGIONAL AND OTHER PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

AT PRESENT LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA, AS ELSEWHERE, HAVE TO COMPETE WITH MASS
MEDIA, IN PARTICULAR WITH TELEVISION. MIGRATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO TOWNS
HAMPERS EXPANSION OF LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS. PEOPLE BUY MORE BOOKS AND USE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES LESS THAN IN THE PAST. IN SPITE OF THIS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER
NEGATIVE FACTORS, INTEREST IN READING HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE
POPULATION'S LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME MORE BALANCED. THUS THE STAFF
IN LOCAL PUBLIC AND CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES HAVE TO PLAN CAREFULLY TO
ATTRACT NEW READERS. ALL AGES AND SOCIAL GROUPS MUST BE CATERED FOR. IN
ADDITION TO BOOKS, SPECIAL PRINTED MATERIAL, SUCH AS SHEET-MUSIC AND
REPRODUCTION OF PAINTINGS, MUST BE MORE FULLY USED.
THE DYNAMIC PUBLIC LIBRARY.

A PRACTICAL DISCUSSION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S ROLE AS AN AGENT FOR SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. TO ATTRACT READERS, THE LIBRARIAN MUST
DESIGN SERVICES TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS AND INTERESTS; HERE, CONTACT WITH LOCAL
COMMUNITY LEADERS IS ESSENTIAL. TO PROJECT A DYNAMIC IMAGE, SERVICES MUST BE
MANIFESTLY RELEVANT AND EFFICIENT, AND GEARED NOT ONLY TO EXISTING USERS BUT
ALSO TO NON-USERS. EMPHASISES THAT THE LIBRARY'S PRIORITY IS TO COUNTERACT
GENERAL PUBLIC APATHY BY BOLD INITIATIVES; SUGGESTS VARIOUS STRATEGIES FOR
DRAWING PUBLIC ATTENTION, AND CONCLUDES WITH A DETAILED PLAN FOR ORGANISING A
NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK, ALONG THE LINES OF THE LATIN AMERICAN NATIONAL BOOK
WEEK, TO HIGHLIGHT PUBLIC LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES.
LIBRARY DISPLAYS.

IDEAS AND HINTS ON THE DESIGN AND PRESENTATION OF LIBRARY DISPLAYS, READING
AREAS, GAMES AND BULLETIN BOARDS ARE PRESENTED BY MEANS OF ILLUSTRATIONS AND
NOTES.
THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY IN THE YEAR 2000.

COMPARES THE PRESENT STATE OF THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY TO THAT IN 1960; FROM
THAT COMPARISON SOME PREDICTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE NEXT 20-YEAR PERIOD. THE
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY WILL BE DETERMINED BY 3
FACTORS' TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND THE ABILITY
OF INDUSTRY TO PRODUCE VIABLE SYSTEMS. PREDICTS A TREND TOWARDS UNIFICATION OF
COMPONENTS OF THE INDUSTRY, TOGETHER WITH ONE OF ELIMINATION OF INTERMEDIARIES
IN THE INFORMATION FLOW.

APPOINTED BY THE US NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN
RECOGNITION OF THE CONFLICT OVER THE ROLES OF THE 2 SECTORS IN INFORMATION
GENERATION, COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISSEMINATION. THE TASK FORCE HAS
FORMULATED PRINCIPLES FOR FEDERAL POLICY AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR
IMPLEMENTATION. IT IS IN FAVOUR OF' OPEN ACCESS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
INFORMATION; RELIANCE UPON LIBRARIES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO MAKE THIS
INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE; A LEADERSHIP (RATHER THAN MANAGEMENT) ROLE FOR
GOVERNMENT; AND LIMITING DIRECT GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN THE MARKETPLACE.
PROFESSIONAL PROBLEMS OF LIBRARIANSHIP PRACTICE.

LIBRARIES AS MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRES; THE DANISH EXPERIENCE.

TALK GIVEN TO THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING HELD IN STOCKHOLM AUG 80. THE
DANISH LOCAL AUTHORITY REFORMS OF 1970 AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING ACT OF
1977, WHICH EXTENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE, INTENSIFIED THE DEMAND FOR A
MORE EFFICIENT PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICE. TO SATISFY THIS DEMAND THE STATE
INFORMATION OFFICE FOR DISTRIBUTION OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION WAS SET UP IN
1977 AND COOPERATION WITH LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED. THE REPORT ON 'LOCAL
PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY' STIMULATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC INFORMATION
SERVICES IN LIBRARIES. THE 'KOMMUNE-INFORMATION' AT THE TOWN LIBRARY OF
LYNGBY-TAARBAEK WAS SET UP IN 1977. IT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE REFERENCE ROOM
AND STAFFED BY 1 FULL-TIME LIBRARIAN. CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE TOWN HALL
EXISTS AND CONTACT PERSONS IN EACH DEPARTMENT WERE APPOINTED. ALL MATERIAL
AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO KOMMUNE-INFORMATION IS CATALOGUED AND DISPLAYED AND SOME
MAY BE BORROWED. AN INFORMATIO N INDEX OF LOCAL ITEMS IS BEING BUILT UP.
AROUND 400 ENQUIRIES A MONTH ARE DEALT WITH, SOME BY REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT
DEPARTMENT, OTHERS DIRECTLY, CONCERNING' DECISIONS MADE, RIGHTS AND DUTIES,
ON-GOING PROJECTS, LOCAL GROUPS AND SOCIETIES. DESPITE THE NEED FEW OTHER
LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE FOLLOWED THIS EXAMPLE.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. 4TH REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE FOR
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES (1978-80).

THE FIRST 3 REPORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE AVAILABLE AS EUR 5177, EUR 5597 AND
EUR 6158 RESPECTIVELY. THE 1ST 3-YEAR PLAN OF ACTION WAS 1975-77 AND THIS
FORMED THE BASIS OF THE 2ND 3-YEAR PLAN OF ACTION (1978-80), THE ACTIVITIES OF
WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT.
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION-A PRE-CONDITION OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.

IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION
ARE AT PRESENT IN OPERATION NOT ONLY IN DESIGN CENTRES AND RESEARCH
INSTITUTES, BUT ALSO IN ALL LARGER FACTORIES. THE CORE OF SUCH A CENTRE IS THE
TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN MOST LIBRARIES, PERIODICALS AND MONOGRAPHS STILL
PREVAIL, BUT LATELY PATENTS, STANDARDS, DISSERTATIONS, RESEARCH REPORTS, TRADE
CATALOGUES AND DOCUMENTARY FILMS ARE AVAILABLE. THE CENTRES' ACTIVITIES
DEPEND, OF COURSE, VERY MUCH ON STAFF AND EQUIPMENT. BUILDING UP DATA AND
DOCUMENTATION BASES, UNDER EXPLORATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES, IS
OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE. TRANSLATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM FOREIGN LANGUAGES
INTO SLOVAK AND CZECH ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. INFORMATION USERS ARE TAUGHT TO USE
INFORMATION SOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. IN ADDITION TO OTHER
RELEVANT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THEIR OWN CONTINUING EDUCATION, INFORMATION
SCIENT ISTS AND OTHER STAFF SHOULD ENGAGE IN THEORETICAL STUDIES AND RESEARCH,
THE RESULTS OF WHICH SHOULD BE PUBLISHED WHEREVER POSSIBLE.
SCIENCE AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT' TOWARDS A
POLICY OF ACTION.

ANALYSES THE FRENCH SYSTEM OF ORGANISING THE DIFFUSION OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
ALSACE REGIONAL AGENCY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION (ARIST) IN
MEETING THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE VARIOUS
ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE REGION INVOLVED IN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND THEIR ACTIVITIES, SHOWING THE TENDENCY TO OVERLAP
AND DUPLICATE SERVICES, AND THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE 2A PRIORI1 INFORMATION TO
ASSIST USERS TO ANTICIPATE DEVELOPMENTS. PROPOSALS ARE THEN PRESENTED FOR
IMPROVING SERVICES THROUGH LINKING THE VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS CONCERNED, SO
THAT BY POOLING TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION, DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE
PREDICTED, AND PROGRAMMES OF STRATEGIC INTERVENTION DEVELOPED FOR BUSINESS
INTERESTS AFFECTED.
THE DIFFUSION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION IN FRANCE. EXAMPLES OF
INITIATIVES UNDERTAKEN BY THE ALSACE REGIONAL AGENCY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION (ARIST).

AN ACCOUNT OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SERVICES TO INDUSTRY PROVIDED BY ARIST
SHOWING KINDS OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND INFORMATION STRATEGIES EVOLVED TO
SOLVE THEM. A PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION IS GIVEN OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE
FRENCH NATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. 4 LEVELS OF
INTERVENTION ARE DESCRIBED WITH SPECIFIC EXAMPLES' THE READY-REFERENCE TYPE
INFORMATION SERVICE; PROVISION OF SPECIALISED SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, AND
ECONOMIC DOCUMENTS ON A GIVEN SUBJECT; PREPARATION OF ANALYTICAL REPORTS
SUMMARISING ALL ASPECTS OF A PARTICULAR PROBLEM, INVOLVING CONSULTATION WITH
SPECIALISTS AND SPECIAL RESEARCH; AND A COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE TO ASSIST FIRMS
IN DIVERSIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT. INVITES CRITICISM OF THE TECHNIQUES
DESCRIBED SO THAT SERVICES CAN BE IMPROVED.
IMPLEMENTATION OF A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM.

TO ESTABLISH A GENERAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (S&T) INFORMATION DELIVERY
SYSTEM IN NEBRASKA, A LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED, AND AN
IN-SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAMME WAS DEVELOPED WITH EMPHASIS ON S&T INFORMATION
FOR THE LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH STAFF. TO ADDRESS THE DELIVERY OF S&T INFORMATION
INTO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, PROTOTYPE DATA BASES ON CERTAIN S&T TOPICS WHICH
RECEIVED SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION WERERE CREATED THROUGH THE USE OF
EXISTING COMPUTER COMPATIBILITY.
EXCHANGE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT, FISCAL YEAR 1980.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXCHANGE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION (EMI) PROGRAMME FOR 1980.
ESTABLISHED BY PUBLIC LAW 89785, THE PROGRAMME'S PURPOSE IS TO FUND AND
SUPPORT PILOT PROJECTS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA)
MEDICAL FACILITIES LOCATED IN REMOTE AREAS BY PROMOTING CONSULTATION AND
CO-OPERATION WITH MEDICAL PERSONNEL AT MEDICAL TEACHING CENTRES AND LARGER
MEDICAL FACILITIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE VA HOSPITAL SYSTEM.
STRATEGIES FOR AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION REVIEWS AND GREY LITERATURE.

AS A RESULT OF THE CRAIG REPORT (2SEE1 80/4557) AND ITS FOLLOW-UP (2SEE1
81/3454) THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND THE NEED TO DEVELOP BETTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS
FOR, NON-CONVENTIONAL LITERATURE AND REVIEWS WAS HIGHLIGHTED. THE OBJECTIVES
OF THE STUDY WERE TO PRESENT A COMMENTARY ON GREY LITERATURE AND REVIEWS IN
AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION IN THE UK AND TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF
THE RESEARCH NEEDS IN THE AREA AND MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR
IMPLEMENTATION.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES WITHIN THE IRON AND STEEL
INDUSTRY 1961-1981.

(STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONAL ACHIEVEMENT SUBMITTED FOR FELLOWSHIP OF THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION). AN ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE AUTHOR'S ACHIEVEMENTS OR CONTRIBUTIONS
TO LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE UK IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY OVER 20
YEARS.
THE INFORMATION USER IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY-A STUDY OF THE EDUCATIONAL
NEED AND PROVISION.

THERE IS AMPLE RECORD THAT INFORMATION HANDLING OCCUPIES A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF
PRODUCTION TIME AND THAT POOR PERFORMANCE IN THIS FIELD IS AT THE ROOT OF MANY
OF THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS. SUCH PROBLEMS FALL INTO 2 MAIN CATEGORIES. THE 1ST
RELATES TO BUILDINGS THEMSELVES AND CONCERNS PHYSICAL (COLLAPSE, FIRE, LEAKS,
CONDENSATION) AND SPATIAL (SHORT LIFE, TIGHT FIT, HIGH ENERGY) FAILURE. THE
2ND CATEGORY CONCERNS ORGANISATIONAL FAILURES. CLEARLY IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH
THESE CATEGORIES COULD BE BENEFICIAL.
INFORMATION TRANSFER' A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, INFORMATION
SCIENCE AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY WORK. TRADITIONALLY, THERE ARE 5 BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH THE LIBRARY AND
LIBRARIANSHIP PERFORM FOR SOCIETY-ARCHIVAL, CULTURAL, EDUCATIONAL,
RECREATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL. UNFORTUNATELY, LIBRARY EDUCATION, WHILE GIVING
LIP-SERVICE TO THE OTHER FUNCTIONS, HAS REMAINED PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ARCHIVAL
ACTIVITIES. PROPOSES A THEORETICAL MODEL OF INFORMATION TRANSFER. THE
RESPECTIVE ROLES OF LIBRARIANS, INFORMATION SCIENTISTS AND INFORMATION
MANAGERS ARE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THIS MODEL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 5 FUNCTIONS
DISCUSSED ABOVE. IMPLICATIONS FOR CURRICULUM DESIGN ARE DISCUSSED.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAMMES OF STUDY BASED ON A COMMON CORE, BUT WITH
DISTINCT AREAS OF SPECIALISATION FOR STUDENTS TRAINING FOR THE 3 PROFESSIONAL
FIELDS, ARE PRESENTED.
INFORMATION AS A COMMODITY' THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE HUNCH.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIANS MEETING AT
THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO, 14 DEC
81. IN THE USA AMIDST AN ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION THERE ARE GROWING
RESTRICTIONS ON ITS SOCIAL AVAILABILITY AND USE. INFORMATION IS BECOMING A
MARKET COMMODITY, THE INFORMATION RESOURCE BASE ITSELF SHIFTING FROM THE
PUBLIC TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH SETS TO MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY CONTROL OF ITS
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LEADING TO INCREASING RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS. DISCUSSES
INFORMATION AS A COMMODITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND IN GOVERNMENT.
THE FUTURE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY' A PANORAMA OF THE ACTUAL
SITUATION.

RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN FRANCE, USA AND THE UK. THE 1978 FRENCH REPORT BY NORA
AND MINC IS DISCUSSED FULLY WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ITS COVERAGE OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, THE QUESTION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN
GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, THE ROLE OF INFORMATION IN
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ISSUES INVOLVED. RECENT US
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LITERATURE PREDICTING FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
INFORMATION SOCIETY ARE SURVEYED, AND RELATED TO THE FRENCH VIEWPOINT.
CONSIDERS THE SITUATION IN SPAIN AND WHAT KIND OF POLICY SHOULD BE ADOPTED IN
THE LIGHT OF INITIAL FINDINGS, AND IN CONCLUSION EXAMINES THE QUESTION OF
SECURITY OF INFORMATION WITH REFERENCE TO DATA BASES AND DECOMOCRATISATION.
EMPHASISES THE NECESSITY FOR A GLOBAL VIEW IN POLICY PLANNING AND THE NEED FOR
AN OFFICIAL REPORT ON SPAIN'S ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL SITUATION.
THE ROLE OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION RESOURCES IN CANADA.

EXAMINES THE ENTIRE RANGE OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION MATTERS IN TERMS
OF UNDERLYING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FORCES IN CANADA WITH SPECIAL
EMPHASIS ON CANADA'S 3 MAIN CONCERNS' UNITY, ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND CULTURAL
IDENTITY. IT IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BASE FOR FUTURE EXAMINATION OF
US-CANADIAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION RELATIONSHIPS.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND INFORMATION ARRANGEMENT.

DESCRIBES AN ATTEMPT BY ASLIB TO DEVELOP A CHECKLIST FOR THE EVALUATION OF
INFORMATION SERVICES COVERING CURRENT AWARENESS SERVICES, INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SERVICES, DOCUMENT DELIVERY AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EVALUATION
ACTIVITIES. THERE WAS LITTLE SUPPORT FROM PRACTITIONERS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
GUIDELINES RELATING TO SPECIFIC ITEMS IN THE CHECKLIST BUT CHOOSING BETWEEN AN
IN-HOUSE DATA BASE AND RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL SUPPLIES WAS SEEN AS AN ISSUE OF
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE. SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR A 'USER-FRIENDLY' PACKAGE BRINGING
TOGETHER THE BEST OF THE LITERATURE ON PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TO ENCOURAGE
ITS WIDESPREAD ADOPTION.
THE INFORMATION FUTURE AND ITS CHALLENGES TO INFORMATION MANAGERS.

STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION AS AN ECONOMIC PRODUCT AND EMPHASISES
ITS VITAL ROLE IN SOCIETY. SINCE THE VALUE OF INFORMATION TO SOCIETY IS
INCREASING, ITS MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED-THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO
INFORMATION MANAGERS, PARTICULARLY IN BALANCING REDUCTION OF RESOURCE
INVESTMENTS AND INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF INFORMATION ASSETS. AN ANALYSIS OF
THE INFORMATION CYCLE IN THIS RESPECT IS GIVEN AND A PLEA IS MADE FOR
INFORMATION MANAGERS TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
FUTURE OFFICE.
INCREASING USE OF DATA TELECOMMUNICATIONS CALLS FOR STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTION
AND IMPROVED ECONOMIES.

THE US GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE HAS CONCLUDED THAT INCREASING USE OF DATA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CALLS FOR STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTION AND IMPROVED ECONOMIES,
AFTER CONDUCTING A REVIEW OF CIVIL AGENCY DATA TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND
RELATED PRIVACY ISSUES. THE OFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON
THE JUDICIARY AND HOUSE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS THAT CONGRESS
REVISE 'WIRETAP' LAWS TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS; AND THAT THE
DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ISSUE EXTRA EXECUTIVE LEVEL
PROTECTIVE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES FOR DATA TRANSMISSIONS OF PERSONAL DATA,
AND MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO CONGRESS ON THE
MERITS AND PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATING A COMMON-USER DATA TELECOMMUNICATIONS
NETWORK FOR THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT.
SURVEYS ON PRIVACY AND BIG BUSINESS, BANKING, AND INSURANCE.

THE SURVEYS, CONDUCTED BY THE SURVEY RESEARCH LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS, SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH POLICIES SAFEGUARDING
PERSONAL, FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. RESULTS
INDICATE THAT SOME LARGE US INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS HAVE INADEQUATE POLICIES
TO PROTECT SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE DATA FROM POSSIBLE ABUSE; THE IDEA THAT A
PERSON'S FINANCES ARE A PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN HIM AND HIS BANKER IS NO LONGER
TRUE; AND THAT MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE ADOPTED MANY PROTECTIONS
RECOMMENDED BY THE US PRIVACY PROTECTION STUDY COMMISSION AFTER AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S RECORD-KEEPING PRACTICES.
COMPUTER-BASED NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY
ISSUES.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY ON THE USE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN NATIONAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND RELATED PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
WAS TO PROVIDE' A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERISED NATIONAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS; A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING COMPUTER/INFORMATION POLICY ISSUES; A
STATE OF THE ART SURVEY OF COMPUTER AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES/INDUSTRIES; AND A
FOUNDATION FOR OTHER RELATED STUDIES.
HYSTERIA IS UNNECESSARY' OBSERVATIONS FROM A STUDY TOUR OF THE USA.

THE TOUR WAS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH PLANS FOR DEVELOPING GERMAN INFORMATION
AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES. MANY US DEVELOPMENTS COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED
DIRECTLY TO EUROPE SINCE THEY WOULD BE UNSUITABLE FOR A SMALL MARKET. IN THE
USA A WIDE RANGE OF INSTITUTIONS IS INVOLVED IN INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, IN
CONTRAST WITH THE SMALLER, GOVERNMENT-BASED ORGANISATION PLANNED FOR WEST
GERMANY. THE US ECONOMIC CLIMATE LENDS ITSELF TO EXPERIMENT BETTER THAN THE
EUROPEAN. THE US MARKET FOR LITERATURE REFERENCE DATA BASES HAS REACHED
SATURATION POINT AND THE MAIN GROWTH AREAS ARE IN FACTOGRAPHIC AND FULL TEXT
DATA BASES. CURRENT TRENDS ARE AGAINST THE SUPERMARKET APPROACH TO SELLING. A
WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT. MANY PEOPLE
CONSIDER THAT THE CLOSE LINK WITH LIBRARIES IS RETURNING INFORMATION SCIENCE
DEVELOPMENT.

SUMMARY OF A PRESENTATION DELIVERED AT THE FRENCH LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION
PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP STUDY SESSION IN JAN 81. B.I.P.A. IS A PUBLIC ARCHIVE
FOR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFORMATION. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND PROCESSING ACTIVITIES, IN RELATION TO
ADMINISTRATIVE, POLITICAL, PRESS, AND PHOTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; AND DIFFUSION
ACTIVITIES, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ON-LINE ACCESS TO DATA, MICROFICHE
MATERIALS, AND PUBLICATIONS, INCLUDING CATALOGUES AND INDEXES.
MEDICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS' APPLICATIONS AND EVALUATION. 1973-APRIL, 1982
(CITATIONS FROM THE ENGINEERING INDEX DATA BASE).

BIBLIOGRAPHY CONTAINS CITATIONS CONCERNING THE APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER BASED
INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN HOSPITALS, CLINICS, LABORATORIES, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES
FOR DATA RECORDING AND REPORTING OF PATIENT MEDICAL AND ACCOUNTING RECORDS.
MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN GENERAL PRACTICE.

(MSC THESIS). IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY REALISED THAT
INFORMATION HANDLING IN GENERAL PRACTICE IS INADEQUATE FOR PROVIDING A HIGH
STANDARD OF HEALTH CARE, PARTICULARLY IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND CHRONIC
DISEASE SURVEILLANCE. THE CONVENTIONAL PATIENT RECORDS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY
CRITICISED. A QUESTIONNAIRE SENT TO GENERAL PRACTITIONERS INTERESTED IN
MICROCOMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS REVEALED THAT WITHIN 3 YEARS MOST OF
THE GROUP WOULD BE OPERATING SUCH SYSTEMS.
A TEXTBOOK OF CRITICAL THINKING-PRODUCED BY TECHNICAL SERVICES-NEEDED BY
PATRON'S SERVICES.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE TEACHING OF LIBRARY USE TO PATRONS OF THE REFERENCE
SECTION OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION LIBRARY AND STUDENTS OF
THE SCHOOL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. DISCUSSES THE
INFORMATION PYRAMID WITH FACT AS ITS BASE, OPINION AS THE MIDSECTION AND VALUE
JUDGMENT AS THE CAPSTONE. LIBRARIANS SHOULD AIM TO FILL THE MISSING LINK
BETWEEN BASIC LITERACY SKILLS AND CRITICAL THINKING.
THE TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT IN LIBRARY USER EDUCATION.

FOR AN ABSTRACT 2SEE1 82/1797.
THE IMPORTANCE OF TEACHING USE OF THE LIBRARY.

INTRODUCTION TO AN OCCASIONAL SERIES ON USE INSTRUCTIONS IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES. BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION IS TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO FIND
INFORMATION EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN THE MODERN LIBRARY. INSTITUTING
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES PERMITS STUDENTS TO DO BETTER WORK, TO BE
MORE INDEPENDENT IN THEIR WORK AND TO HAVE MORE MOTIVATION. THIS ALLOWS
ASSIGNMENTS TO BE MORE VARIED AND EXPECTATIONS CAN BE HIGHER. BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INSTRUCTION ALSO HELPS TO INSURE THAT THE COLLECTION IS WELL USED-AN IMPORTANT
ARGUMENT WHEN COST EFFECTIVENESS IS A PRIME CONSIDERATION IN ALL
ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION...AGAIN.

DESCRIBES SOME RECENT INNOVATIONS IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES IN COLORADO. THESE INCLUDE' A NEW 2 HOUR INSTRUCTION PROGRAMME AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO WHICH AIMS TO TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO DEVELOP SEARCH
STRATEGIES; THE USE OF THE AUTOMATED CATALOGUE AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL; THE
COMPILATION OF A DIRECTORY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION IN COLORADO LIBRARIES;
AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR IDEAS AND MATERIALS DEALING WITH
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION.
USER TRAINING IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES' A GENERAL APPROACH.

A DISCUSSION RELATING RECENT LITERATURE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH TO THE
BRAZILIAN SITUATION, WHERE THIS FIELD HAS BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED. THE MAIN
OBJECTIVE OF SUCH PROGRAMMES IS TO TRAIN CHILDREN HOW TO USE LIBRARIES, AND
ACQUAINT THEM WITH THE SERVICES AVAILABLE; HERE THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN IN
PRESENTING THE LIBRARY AS A PLACE FOR BOTH LEISURE AND STUDY IS CRUCIAL.
TRAINING PROGRAMMES ARE PRESENTED, FOR BOTH NEW USERS AND OLDER CHILDREN, AND
TEACHING METHODS WHICH CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM SUGGESTED.
FINALLY, SURVEYS TECHNIQUES FOR EVALUATING PROGRESS AND IN CONCLUSION
EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY TRAINING FOR THE CHILD'S FUTURE SOCIAL
AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
USER EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES.

THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN SHOULD TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN THE TEACHING OF INFORMATION
AND RESEARCH SKILLS TO PUPILS WITHOUT SUBJECT BIAS. GETTING TO KNOW PUPILS IS
IMPORTANT SO THAT THE APPROPRIATE SERVICE CAN BE OFFERED. REGULAR LIBRARY
VISITS FOR 1ST-YEAR PUPILS ARE ESPECIALLY VALUABLE AND ARE BEST DONE BY
TIMETABLING A LIBRARY LESSON THAT IS NOT ATTACHED TO A PARTICULAR SUBJECT
AREA. THEREAFTER VISITS CAN BE ORGANISED AS REQUIRED BUT THE NEED FOR A MORE
STRUCTURED APPROACH IS OFTEN FELT BY THE START OF THE 4TH YEAR. IT IS
IMPORTANT TOO THAT THE TEACHING STAFF HAVE RESEARCH AND INFORMATION SKILLS AND
THESE CAN BE DEVELOPED BY THE LIBRARIAN.
TEACHING TECHNIQUES FOR THE USE OF LIBRARIES.

SCHOOL CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE LIBRARIES AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN A
LIBRARY. SURVEYS WERE CARRIED OUT TO FIND OUT WHAT LITERATURE CHILDREN READ.
BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE SURVEYS A COURSE FOR TEACHING CHILDREN
TECHNIQUES FOR THE USE OF LIBRARIES WAS DEVELOPED. THE COURSE CONSISTED OF
CLASSWORK' ANALYSING FAVOURITE BOOKS, DISCOVERING THE CONTENTS LIST, PREFACE,
TITLE, PUBLISHER ETC. AND VISITS TO LIBRARIES. DURING LIBRARY VISITS THE
CHILDREN WORKED IN GROUPS WITH GIVEN TASKS. THROUGH ASKING LIBRARIANS AND
OTHERS THEY WERE TO DISCOVER VARIOUS MEANS OF FINDING BOOKS. THEY WERE ALSO
ENCOURAGED TO FIND OUT HOW A LIBRARY IS ORGANISED, WHAT LENDING CONDITIONS ARE
AND WHAT TRAINING A LIBRARIAN NEEDS. THE GROUPS COMPARED THEIR RESULTS IN
CLASSWORK.
BOOKS AND SCI-TECH STUDENTS AND ACADEMICS.

LOOKS AT THE WAY IN WHICH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDENTS AND LECTURERS USE
THE LIBRARY AND SUGGESTS SOME METHODS OF PROMOTING BETTER USE BY THESE GROUPS
THROUGH USER EDUCATION. TECHNICAL SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN
ESTABLISHING ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE EYES OF ACADEMICS.
EVALUATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL ACTIVITIES IN CURITIBA.

REPORT OF A STUDY CONCERNING LOCAL PRODUCTION OF CATALOGUES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES
IN CURITIBA, BRAZIL. EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH PUBLISHERS COMPLY WITH LEGAL
DEPOSIT REGULATIONS, CATALOGUING IN PUBLICATION PROJECTS, AND THE NATIONALLY
RECOMMENDED PUBLISHING STANDARDS. DATA COLLECTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARANA
LIBRARY SCHOOL WAS USED TO ANALYSE COVERAGE BY BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND UNION
CATALOGUES PUBLISHED OVER THE DECADE 1970-80; RESULTS SHOWED THAT LOCAL
LIBRARIANS WERE CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CREATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS,
WHILE PUBLISHERS GENERALLY DISREGARDED THEIR OBLIGATIONS. RECOMMENDS STRICTER
ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL DEPOSIT AND GREATER ENCOURAGEMENT FOR LOCAL LIBRARY
ACTIVITIES.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL' A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE.

A LIST OF REFERENCES COVERING BRAZILIAN AND FOREIGN LITERATURE ON
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1970-80. PRELIMINARY DETAILS ARE GIVEN
OF SOURCES USED FOR COLLECTING MATERIAL AND THE SYSTEM OF ARRANGEMENT. THE
REFERENCES ARE DIVIDED INTO 12 SECTIONS' BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL; INFORMATION
SYSTEMS; INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUING CODES; LEGAL DEPOSIT; NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIES; INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES; COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING; UNION
CATALOGUES; CATALOGUING IN SOURCE; SIMPLIFIED CATALOGUING; AUTOMATED
CATALOGUING; AND PERIODICALS.
HMSO CATALOGUE DEVELOPMENTS' A PERSONAL ACCOUNT.

DISCUSSES SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS IN HMSO CATALOGUING SERVICES THAT HAVE
TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE AUTHOR TOOK OVER AS HEAD OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES IN
1979. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY' IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE TIMETABLING
OF CATALOGUES; THE INTRODUCTION OF THE DAILY PRESTEL INFORMATION SERVICE; AND
THE COMPUTERISATION OF CATALOGUING. LISTS ALL PUBLICATIONS CURRENTLY PRODUCED
UNDER HMSO'S BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROGRAMME, AND CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS
CATALOGUE RECORDS BEING MADE AVAILABLE ON-LINE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL IN THE FIELD OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IN BRAZIL.

A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT STRESSING THE NEED FOR BRAZILIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL
TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF PUBLICATION AND RESEARCH. DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE
FACTORS INFLUENCING THE GENERATION OF INFORMATION IN THIS FIELD, WHERE THE
LITERATURE IS INCREASING RAPIDLY. COMPREHENSIVE DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
AVAILABLE BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PROJECTS INITIATED
BY THE BRAZILIAN INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION (IBICT),
AS WELL AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SCHOOLS. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RELEVANCE OF THESES, PERIODICAL
CATALOGUES, AND RESEARCH DIRECTORIES IS EXAMINED, AND IN CONCLUSION EMPHASISES
THE NEED TO COORDINATE INITIATIVES IN THIS FIELD FOR MORE RATIONAL COVERAGE.
RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING IN SPANISH HISTORY.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A MADRID CONFERENCE IN 1981 TO DEMONSTRATE THE SPANISH
INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND
HUMANITIES (ISOC) APPROACH TO RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING WHEN THE LITERATURE OF
THE SUBJECT IS MAINLY IN SPANISH. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT
SELECTED, AND ITS SUITABILITY AS A SAMPLE TOPIC DISCUSSED, IN RELATION TO
GENERAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE SEARCHER AND APPLICABILITY OF TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED
TO THE HUMANITIES FIELD IN GENERAL. RESULTS OBTAINED USING 4 DATA BASES AND 2
SPANISH INDEXES ARE PRESENTED AND ANALYSED IN TERMS OF OVERLAP, DATE OF
PUBLICATION, COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, AND TYPE OF PERIODICAL. IN CONCLUSION A
COMPARISON IS MADE SHOWING THE ADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATED OVER MANUAL SEARCHING.
A PROFILE OF THE TYPICAL ISOC USER IS PRESENTED, AND FINALLY RECOMMENDATIONS
ARE MADE CONCERNING USER TRAINING, PRICING OF SEARCH SERVICES, AND AUTOMATION
PROGRAMMES.

DESCRIBES THE CONVERSION OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH
SERVICE'S CURRENT AWARENESS SERVICE FROM A MANUAL TO AN AUTOMATED MODE,
EMPHASISING THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATION UPON STAFF AND CLIENTELE. ALTHOUGH
INITIALLY THE CONVERSION WAS ATTENDED BY VARIOUS STAFF AND EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS,
FULL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. AUTOMATION PRODUCED NO
SAVING IN EITHER TIME OR STAFF; RATHER THE CONTRARY. HOWEVER THE TRUE BENEFITS
OF AUTOMATION APPEAR AS A MULTIPLICITY OF PREVIOUSLY UNOBTAINABLE SERVICES AND
PRODUCTS OF FAR-RANGING UTILITY TO SYSTEM USERS.
SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

PRESENTS A HISTORICAL REVIEW OF SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AS A
CURRENT AWARENESS SYSTEM, THE NEED FOR IT, AND SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS REFERENCE CORRESPONDENCE REFERRAL PROGRAM.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE REFERENCE AND ADULT SERVICES DIVISION COOPERATIVE
REFERENCE SERVICE COMMITTEE PROGRAMME AT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO, 29 JUNE 81. DESCRIBES THE SETTING UP OF A
COOPERATIVE REFERRAL SYSTEM TO ANSWER WRITTEN REFERENCE ENQUIRIES SENT TO THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. AS AN EXPERIMENT, ENQUIRIES OF A GENERAL NATURE, NOT
SPECIFICALLY NEEDING AN ANSWER FROM THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WERE PASSED ONTO
OREGON STATE LIBRARY TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND SPEED UP REPLIES. LATER OTHER
STATE LIBRARIES JOINED THE SCHEME. SUGGESTS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AT
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, REFERRAL FROM THE BOTTOM UP AS WELL AS THE TOP DOWN, AND
THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL.

82/5808) AND BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE SLAVIC REFERENCE
SERVICE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS (2SEE1 82/5812) AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY
LENDING DIVISION. CONCLUDES THAT IF A NATIONAL-LEVEL REFERRAL SYSTEM IS NOT TO
BE OVERLOADED WITH INAPPROPRIATE REQUESTS THAT UNNECESSARILY INCREASE THE
COSTS, THERE MUST BE ADEQUATE LOCAL REFERENCE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO ALL US
RESIDENTS AND A PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THESE LOCAL SERVICES.
INFOPASS' SOME ORGANIZATIONAL CONCERNS OF A LOCAL COOPERATIVE REFERENCE
PROGRAM.

A 3-MONTH TRIAL OF THE DEARBORN AREA LIBRARIES INFOPASS SYSTEM (DALIS), A
LOCAL LIBRARY COOPERATIVE PROGRAMME COORDINATING THE REFERENCE SERVICES OF 6

DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOURAL OUTCOMES OF THE REFERENCE PROCESS,
AND THE CAUSAL FACTORS THAT INHIBIT THE DELIVERY OF REFERENCE SERVICE. DATA
ARE PRESENTED ON 16 LIBRARIES THAT PARTICIPATED IN A NATIONAL STUDY OF LIBRARY
ECONOMICS. DATA ON BEHAVIOURAL AND CAUSAL ASPECTS ARE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED
SEPARATELY; GROUP OR COMPOSITE VALUES FOR THE PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS ARE
PRESENTED. THESE ARE TRANSFORMED TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE STAFF, THE COLLECTION, AND THE PATRONS. GROUP VALUES,
TOGETHER WITH THE RANGE AND MEDIANS, ARE PRESENTED. THE QUESTION OF HOW THE
LIBRARIAN'S PERCEPTION OF SUCCESS IS RELATED TO THE PATRON'S PERCEPTION, AND
TO THE VALIDITY OF THE ANSWERS PROVIDED, IS DISCUSSED BRIEFLY.
INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY.

REPORT OF AN INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY, HELD AT THE
BRITISH LIBRARY, LENDING DIVISION, SEPT 80, AND ARRANGED BY IFLA AND THE
BRITISH COUNCIL. THE AIM WAS TO DISCUSS DOCUMENT SUPPLY AS A PART OF THE
UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS PROGRAMME.

SOME RECENT APPLICATIONS OF ELECTRONICS TO INFORMATION PROCESSING AND TRANSFER
ARE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE PROBLEMS OF UNIVERSAL
AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS DISCUSSED. THE DEVELOPMENTS MENTIONED INCLUDE
FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION, VIDEODISC TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING, WORD
PROCESSING IN VARIOUS FORMS AND TELETEXT OR VIDEOTEXT. ALL ARE BASED ON THE
MANIPULATION OF TEXT AND GRAPHICAL INFORMATION IN A DIGITISED OR
MACHINE-READABLE FORM, WHICH ALLOWS A RANGE OF OPTIONS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF
INFORMATION TO THE CONSUMER.
ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENT AVAILABILITY AT THE PROF. LUIS DE BESSA CENTRE FOR
CONTINUING EDUCATION.

SUMMARY OF A DISSERTATION PREPARED FOR UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL, BRAZIL. THE STUDY
USED KANTOR'S MATHEMATICAL AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS MODEL, WHICH IS PRESENTED IN
DETAIL. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE PROF. LUIS DE BESSA
CENTRE FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION, LIBRARY HOLDINGS, AND USER HABITS. RESULTS
ARE REPORTED IN FULL, AND ANALYED TO SHOW CAUSES OF FAILURE AT THE SHELF. THE
PROBABLE RATE OF USER SATISFACTION CALCULATED WAS 70%.
CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

A PRACTICAL DISCUSSION BASED ON PUBLISHED MATERIAL, CONVERSATION WITH
LIBRARIANS, AND LIBRARY VISITS. CONSIDERS THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES FOR DEVELOPING SOCIAL AND CULTURAL VALUES, AND THE METHODS AND
TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE; THE OBJECTIVES IN RELATION TO CONVENTIONAL PUBLIC
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES; PLANNING PROCEDURES, WITH A FULL GUIDE FOR IMPLEMENTING A
PROGRAMME; THE HUMAN, MATERIAL, ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES REQUIRED;
EVALUATION TECHNIQUES, TO BE MODIFIED AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE; AND PROGRAMMES
FOR ADULTS, CHILDREN, AND YOUNG PEOPLE, GIVING A WIDE RANGE OF SUGGESTED
ACTIVITIES FOR EACH GROUP. FINALLY EXAMINES THE REASONS WHY LATIN AMERICA HAS
LARGELY FAILED TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMES IN THIS FIELD, AND GIVES EXAMPLE OF
PROJECTS SUCCESSFULLY INITIATED IN COLOMBIA AT 3 LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY.
PROGRAMMING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES' A DISSENTING VIEWPOINT.

THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF PROGRAMMING (THE OFFERING ON NON-BOOK ACTIVITIES IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES) HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN BY MANY LIBRARIANS, BUT HAS BEEN
JUSTIFIED IN SEVERAL WAYS. ADVOCATES THAT THE COMMONEST METHOD IS NOT TO
JUSTIFY IT AT ALL; IN MANY CASES PROGRAMMING IS INEFFECTIVE, AND LITTLE
RIGOROUS EVALUATION HAS EVER BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO PROVE THAT PROGRAMMING CAN
SUCCEED. QUESTIONS THE COMMON UNTHINKING ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEED FOR
PROGRAMMING, AND CITES ANNUAL REPORTS AND STUDIES WHICH INDICATE THE NEED FOR
BETTER EVALUATION THAN HAS HERETOFORE BEEN THE PRACTICE.
SUMMER READING CLUBS COVER CABELL COUNTY.

CABELL COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY'S SUMMER READING PROGRAMME 'SUMMER OF FUN' AND
OTHER PROGRAMMES, ORGANISED WITH THE COOPERATION OF HUNTINGTON'S PUBLIC
TELEVISION STATION, WPBY, REACHED OVER 500 YOUNG PEOPLE FROM PRE-SCHOOL AGE TO
YOUNG ADULTS IN 1981. YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWED A WILLINGNESS TO BE GUIDED AND
SUSTAINED BY PERSONAL INTEREST RATHER THAN INDUCEMENTS SUCH AS AWARDS OR
CERTIFICATES. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT READING CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER
SKILLS, AS WELL AS BEING STIMULATING IN ITSELF. EVALUATION OF THE 1981
PROGRAMME WILL BE USED IN THE PLANNING OF THE 1982 FORMAT.
COOPERATIVE LINKS MADE BY LEIPZIG MUNICIPAL MUSIC LIBRARY.

PUBLICITY WORK PLACES GREAT DEMANDS UPON A SPECIAL LIBRARY. LEIPZIG MUSIC
LIBRARY WORKS CLOSELY WITH MUSIC PUBLISHERS, SCHOOLS, YOUTH CLUBS, THE
UNIVERSITY AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMPOSERS AND MUSICOLOGISTS AND IS
DEVELOPING LINKS WITH THE LOCAL THEATRE AND MUSIC SCHOOLS. THIS RESULTS IN
COOPERATIVE ORGANISATION AND FINANCE FOR MUSICAL ACTIVITIES, JUSTIFIED BECAUSE
OF THE VALUE OF LIVE PERFORMANCES AND THE USE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY MATERIAL. THERE IS GOOD PUBLICITY FOR THE MUSIC LIBRARY'S STOCK OF
140,000 ITEMS INCLUDING SOME VALUABLE 1ST EDITIONS. AGREEMENTS WITH COMPOSERS
AND PUBLISHERS RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON NEW PUBLICATIONS AND
1ST PERFORMANCES AND IN A RATIONAL USE OF MONEY. PUBLICATION EXCHANGES ARE
ESPECIALLY USEFUL. THROUGH COOPERATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY, MUSIC
LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING CAN BE PROVIDED FOR STAFF.
SOME ASPECTS OF TECHNICAL REPORT PROCESSING BY FEDERAL AGENCIES.

TECHNICAL REPORTS ARE A VALUABLE RESOURCE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION WHICH HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SLIP INTO LESS THAN MAXIMUM UTILITY.
WHILE THE PROCESSING OF MORE TRADITIONAL INFORMATION SOURCES HAS PROGRESSED
AND REMARKABLY IMPROVED THROUGH SUCH MECHANISMS AS SHARED CATALOGUING AND
ON-LINE ACCESS TO HUGE FILES OF CATALOGUING DATA, THE CORRESPONDING PROCESSING
OF TECHNICAL REPORTS HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STAGNANT. SOME EFFORTS AT
COORDINATING THE PROCESSING OF REPORTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE 4 US FEDERAL
AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST REPORT COLLECTIONS. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS
SUGGESTED INCLUDE STUDY OF A COMMON REPORT FORMAT, MORE EXTENSIVE SHARED
PROCESSING OF FEDERAL DOCUMENTS AND INCREASED EFFORTS TOWARDS COOPERATION IN
THE FEDERAL LIBRARY NETWORK.

CHOSEN BY THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE SWEDISH ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES.
OVERVIEW OF THE COST OF ACQUIRING, CATALOGING, AND PROCESSING LIBRARY
MATERIALS AT THE TUCSON PUBLIC LIBRARY.

A SYNOPSIS OF 3 STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE TECHNICAL SERVICES AREA OF THE TUCSON
PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM JAN 77-JUNE 80, THIS REPORT PRESENTS ESTIMATED COSTS OF
ACQUIRING, CATALOGUING, AND PROCESSING PRINT AND NONPRINT LIBRARY MATERIALS.
AN AVERAGE COST OF $7.00 PER BOOK COPY AND $12.20 PER NON-PRINT COPY IS
DEVELOPED, AND IT IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH A RANGE OF COSTS THAT ORDERING
PATTERNS (I.E., SINGLE COPIES, MULTIPLE COPIES, NEW TITLES, ADDED TITLES) MAKE
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON UNIT COSTS. AN ORGANISATIONAL CHART SHOWING STAFFING
LEVELS, AN OUTLINE OF ACTIVITIES OF THE 3 SECTIONS OF THE TECHNICAL SERVICES
AREA, AND A SUMMARY OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS BEING USED AT THE TUCSON PUBLIC
LIBRARY ARE INCLUDED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
UNIT TIME/COST STUDY OF THE PROCESSING UNIT, TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION,
TUCSON PUBLIC LIBRARY. REVISED EDITION.

THE 1ST OF 3 REPORTS IN A SERIES TO DETERMINE UNIT TIME AND COST ESTIMATES FOR
THE MAJOR OPERATIONS OF THE TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION OF THE TUCSON PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MEMBERS OF THE PROCESSING UNIT RECORDED DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR A 4-WEEK
PERIOD AND FROM THESE LOGS PROCESSING COSTS WERE DEVELOPED. PROCESSING
PROCEDURES ARE OUTLINED AND TIME AND COST ALLOCATIONS MADE, WITH A SUMMARY
TABLE ITEMISING THESE COSTS IN THE DIVISIONS OF NEW BOOKS, NONPRINT ITEMS, AND
MENDING. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CURRENT TRENDS IN LIBRARIANSHIP WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE BRITISH
SITUATION.

PART 2 OF A 3-PART ARTICLE. FOR AN ABSTRACT OF PART 1, 2SEE1 2LISA1 JAN 83.
DISCUSSES THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND MEDIA STUDIES
BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S PARTICIPATION IN AN OVERSEAS LIBRARIANS COURSE AT LEEDS
POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN 1979. EXAMINES THE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF THE LOCKHEED DIALOG ON-LINE SYSTEM AND COMMENTS FAVOURABLY ON
AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL. VARIOUS TYPES OF COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING
NETWORKS SUCH AS BLAISE AND MASS ARE DISCUSSED. MULTI MEDIA RESOURCE CENTRES
ARE BEING DEVELOPED AT MANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTES IN THE UK AND CAN BE
CONSIDERED AS WORTHWHILE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS BUT THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW MEDIA SUCH AS POOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND SELECTION
AND ORGANISATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.
CLASSIFICATION POLICIES IN DENMARK.

AIMS TO GIVE SOME IDEAS OF CLASSIFICATION AND INDEXING POLICIES IN DANISH
PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES AS WELL AS A STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT OF PRESENT
LITERATURE SEARCHING. DISCUSSES THE INFLUENCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THE
POSSIBILITIES OF UTILISING DATA SUCH AS SUBJECT ENTRIES FROM MARC TAPES FOR
CATALOGUING, AND PREDICTS A DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE NEXT 10 YEARS TOWARDS
ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN 1 OR BOTH OF THE DANISH LIBRARY SECTORS, EITHER
AS LARGE SHARED SYSTEMS OR, PERHAPS MORE LIKELY, AS SMALLER LIBRARY DATA BASES
IN NETWORKS.
THE SUITABILITY OF THE CARIBBEAN SITUATION FOR ESTABLISHING LIBRARY NETWORKS.

TRANSLATED BY CARLOS GIL. ANALYSES THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESSFULLY
IMPLEMENTING AUTOMATED LIBRARY NETWORKS IN THE CARIBBEAN, IN RELATION TO THE
ACTUAL SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DISCUSSION COVERS THE
ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT; THE NEED FOR AND LIKELIHOOD OF
COOPERATION AMONG THE CARIBBEAN STATES; THE PROBABLE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
IMPORTED FROM THE DEVELOPED WORLD; AND THE ABILITY OF CARIBBEAN LIBRARIES TO
IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED PROGRAMMES AND ADAPT TO THEM. CONCLUDES THAT THE OCLC TYPE
NETWORK MODEL IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THE CARIBBEAN SITUATION, REQUIRING TOO GREAT
AN INVESTMENT WITHOUT CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT THE PHYSICAL, POLITICAL AND
SOCIAL OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION COULD BE OVERCOME. RECOMMENDS INSTEAD A
DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF LIBRARY AND TELECOMMUNICATION RESOURCES, WITH A VIEW
TO DEVELOPING AN INDIGENOUS NETWORK.
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA AND ITS IMPORTED DATA SYSTEM.

REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA, CANBERRA, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS
ON ITS DATA SYSTEM IMPORTED FROM THE USA (-FROM THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY
NETWORK).
INTEGRATING AUTOMATION AT VIRGINIA TECH.

DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED LIBRARY PROCESSING SYSTEM AT THE
CAROL M. NEWMAN LIBRARY OF VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE
UNIVERSITY. THE VIRGINIA TECH LIBRARY SYSTEM (VTLS) WILL EVENTUALLY
INCORPORATE CIRCULATION CONTROL, ACQUISITIONS, AND SERIALS CONTROL, AS WELL AS
AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. MENTIONS ON-LINE LINKAGE WITH OCLC AND THE USE OF MARC
RECORDS.
CHINESE MARC' ITS PRESENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARY AUTOMATION,
TAIPEI, TAIWAN, 14-19 FEB 81. TAIWAN'S LIBRARY AUTOMATION PLANNING COMMITTEE
ESTABLISHED THE CHINESE MARC WORKING GROUP IN MAY 80, ASSIGNING IT THE TASK OF
DESIGNING A CHINESE MARC FORMAT WHICH WOULD MEET INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS,
FACILITATE AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING OF CHINESE MATERIALS, AND PROMOTE
INTERNATIONAL RESOURCE SHARING AND EXCHANGE OF CHINESE MATERIALS. OUTLINES THE
UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES, SCOPE, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESULTANT FORMAT,
COMPARES CHINESE MARC WITH UNIMARC (THE FORMER FOLLOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
LATTER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE), LISTS THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE, AND DISCUSSES PLANS
FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
COOPERATION BETWEEN CLANN & ABN.

EXPLORES THE ROLE OF CLANN, THE NETWORK OF 20 COLLEGE, PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN NEW SOUTH WALES, IN RELATION TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
AUSTRALIA'S EMERGING AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK (ABN) SYSTEM. THE
PROPOSED SERVICE FOR ACCESS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA CONFORMING TO NATIONAL
STANDARDS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATION'S
LIBRARIES BUT IT SHOULD BE OPERATED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ENCOURAGE, MAINTAIN
AND SUPPORT VARIOUS NETWORKS AND SERVICES, BOTH THOSE ALREADY EXISTING AND
THOSE THAT MAY BE ESTABLISHED IN THE FUTURE, IN THE LIBRARY COMMUNITY AND IN
THE PRIVATE SECTOR. CLANN'S ROLE SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON MAKING THE OPERATION OF
THE NATIONAL SYSTEM AND OF LOCAL SERVICES AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE IN MEETING
THE NEEDS OF THE LIBRARIES OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
AN INVESTIGATION OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ON-LINE SERIALS HANDLING.

FOR AN ABSTRACT 2SEE1 82/3825.
OCLC SERIALS ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS.

IN 1980, OCLC REACTIVATED ITS SERIALS ADVISORY COMMITTEE, AFTER A 3-YEAR
HIATUS. THE GROUP OF ABOUT 20 MEMBERS REPRESENTING NETWORKS FROM ACROSS THE
USA MET 3 TIMES IN 7 MONTHS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT OCLC INTENDS TO IMPROVE
THE SERIALS CONTROL SUBSYSTEM AND MAKE IT A VIABLE OPTION TO OTHER METHODS OF
SERIALS MANAGEMENT. DISCUSSES DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SUBSYSTEM SUCH AS 2 NEW
VARIABLE FIELDS IN THE LOCAL DATA RECORD-THE SUMMARY COPY HOLDINGS AND SUMMARY
INSTITUTIONS HOLDINGS.
THE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PRINTED BOOKS IN THE 1870S.

WILLIAM BRENCHLEY RYE SUCCEEDED TO THE POST OF KEEPER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
PRINTED BOOKS OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM FROM THOMAS WATTS IN 1869, AND CONTINUED
IN OFFICE UNTIL 1875. ALTHOUGH DESCRIBED AS COMPETENT, WITHOUT MUCH
INITIATIVE, HE LEFT USEFUL REPORTS WHICH GIVE A GOOD PICTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF PRINTED BOOKS AFTER THE PANIZZI PERIOD. SUMMARISES HOLDINGS BY GEOGRAPHICAL
AREA, ACQUISITIONS BY DATE, AND BOOK FUNDS BY YEAR.
ACQUISITIONS IN THE SPECIAL LIBRARY.

ARTICLE BASED ON A PAPER GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY FOR
SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING, SAN FRANCISCO, 2 JUNE 81. LIBRARIES IN BUSINESS AND
INDUSTRY ARE SERVICE-ORIENTED. THEY ARE LESS INTERESTED IN THE PHYSICAL
PACKAGE THAN IN THE CURRENCY OF THE INFORMATION AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH IT
CAN BE DELIVERED.
PROBLEMS AND STRATEGIES FOR EAST ASIAN LIBRARIES IN THE 1980'S.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 33RD ANNUAL MEETING, ASSOCIATION FOR ASIAN STUDIES,
INC., TORONTO, CANADA, 13-15 MAR 81. DISCUSSES THE MEANING OF COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1980S AND THE FISCAL ADVERSITIES FACING EAST ASIAN
COLLECTIONS IN THE USA (INFLATION, BUDGET CUTS, DRAMATIC INCREASES IN COSTS OF
EAST ASIAN BOOKS AND POSTAGE RATES, ND INCREASED DANGER OF CUTS IN
UNDER-UTILISED COLLECTIONS SUCH AS THOSE SPECIALISING IN EAST ASIA). SUGGESTS
STRATEGIES (SPECIALISATION, COOPERATION, SHARING CHECKLISTS OF UNIQUE
HOLDINGS, REDUCTION OF DUPLICATION, AND OPTIMAL USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY) AND
DESCRIBES THE PREPARATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT MADE BY THE EAST ASIAN
COLLECTION OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA.
BACK VOLUME MISCELLANY.

PRESENTS A MODERN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SERIAL BACK VOLUMES, WITH COMMENTS
ON PRICING/VALUES, A GLIMPSE AT HOW THE COLLECTION OF BACK VOLUMES STARTED IN
THE EARLY 1960S, AND SOME INSIGHTS INTO THE WORKINGS OF DEALER OPERATION.
SOURCES AND ACQUISITION PROBLEMS OF SERIALS IN NIGERIAN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO ALVAN IKOKU COLLEGE OF EDUCATION LIBRARY, OWERRI.
NIGERIA.

(MLS THESIS). A REVIEW OF THE USE OF PERIODICALS IN NIGERIAN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES AND THE SOURCES OF PERIODICALS USED BY THESE LIBRARIES IS FOLLOWED
BY A GENERAL ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH CAN CROP UP IN THEIR
ACQUISITION. GENERAL PROBLEMS INCLUDE BUDGETARY CONTROL, COST OF PERIODICALS,
INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS, CENSORSHIP. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IN ACQUISITION
OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC PERIODICALS ARE DESCRIBED.
LOCAL MAP SOURCES: BARGAINS FROM VARIOUS AGENCIES.

REVIEWS SOME OF THE CARTOGRAPHIC BARGAINS AVAILABLE FROM VARIOUS US AGENCIES
OTHER THAN THE COMMONLY USED NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY, AND CONTENDING THAT
IN WEST VIRGINIA A CORE COLLECTION OF LOCAL MAPS MAY BE ACQUIRED FOR $50.00 OR
LESS. AGENCIES INCLUDE THE DEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAYS, WEST VIRGINIA GEOLOGICAL
AND ECONOMIC SURVEY, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES.
UNIT TIME/COST STUDY OF THE ACQUISITIONS UNIT, TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION,
TUCSON PUBLIC LIBRARY.

IN THE 3RD AND FINAL REPORT OF A SERIES DESIGNED TO DEVELOP UNIT TIME AND
COSTS FOR THE MAJOR OPERATIONS OF THE TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION OF THE
TUCSON PUBLIC LIBRARY, THE ACQUISITIONS UNIT'S ACTIVITIES ARE ANALYSED BY
MEANS OF SELF-RECORDED DAILY LOGS. ORDERING, ACCOUNTING, AND RECEIVING ARE
PERFORMED IN THIS AREA, AND THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE DETAILED BOTH IN NARRATIVE
FORM AND A SERIES OF TABLES. SELECTION COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.
A SUMMARY OF UNIT COSTS IS PRESENTED IN WHICH SINGLE AND MULTIPLE COPY
ORDERING VARIATIONS ARE USED AS EXAMPLES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE PURCHASING KEY' A METHOD FOR PROGRAMMING AND CONTROLLING COLLECTIVE
PURCHASING.

SINCE THE 1960S THE CENTRALISATION OF STOCK PROCESSING AND ADVISORY WORK ON
BOOK SELECTION HAS DEMANDED RATIONALISATION METHODS IN LIBRARY ORGANISATION.
THE USE OF PURCHASING KEY CODES IN DRESDEN'S LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
DESCRIBED. IN A COLLECTIVE PURCHASING DECISION EACH PARTICIPANT CAN USE THE
KEY TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE WHOLE NETWORK; THUS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR LITERATURE PROVISION BECOMES GREATER. USING A KEY ALSO ENSURES BALANCED
STOCK PROPORTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NETWORK AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DEMANDS
FOR TIME SAVING AND FOR IMPROVED STOCK QUALITY, THUS OFFERING AN OPTIMAL
SOLUTION FOR UNIFYING STOCKS IN A TERRITORIAL NETWORK.
PURCHASING KEYS' METHODS OF CARRYING OUT IDEAS ON STOCK-BUILDING.

MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID AT PRESENT TO STOCK-BUILDING PROBLEMS, INCLUDING
THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL WITHIN A PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK. WORKING OUT
STOCK-BUILDING PRINCIPLES CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND THIS IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF
STOCK-BUILDING, EVEN IF IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. A PURCHASING KEY IS A CODING
SYSTEM FOR THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES; EXPERIENCES IN
MAGDEBURG HAVE PROVED THE KEY TO BE A USEFUL RATIONALISATION METHOD. THROUGH
THE CODING SYMBOLS THE LIBRARIAN CAN SEE QUICKLY WHAT TYPES OF LITERATURE ARE
IN WHICH LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK. THE SYMBOLS ARE FLEXIBLE AND CAN EASILY BE
KEPT UP TO DATE. OTHER STOCK-BUILDING CRITERIA ARE LITERARY MERIT, SPECIALIST
DEMAND, FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK, NUMBERS OF READERS,
SPACE AND MONEY.
THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF BOOK SELECTION AND CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE POSITION IN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA.

(M.A. THESIS). THE INVESTIGATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY
INTERRELATEDNESS BETWEEN BOOK SELECTION AND CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
CARRIED OUT. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY CENSORSHIP IN UK,
USA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WAS FOLLOWED BY AN EXPLORATORY, EMPIRICAL
INVESTIGATION OF THE POSITION IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE SELECTION POLICIES OF THE 4
PROVINCIAL AND 10 AUTONOMOUS MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES WERE EXAMINED. CONCLUDES THAT
LIBRARIANS SOMETIMES CENSOR AND THAT THERE IS AN INTERRELATEDNESS BETWEEN BOOK
SELECTION AND CENSORSHIP.
A STUDY OF THE INTERACTION IN BOOK SELECTION BETWEEN PROVINCIAL LIBRARY
SYSTEMS AND THEIR AFFILIATED PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.

(M.A. THESIS). EXAMINED CURRENT METHODS OF BOOK SELECTION IN RURAL, PROVINCIAL
LIBRARIES, IN SOUTH AFRICA, WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING WHETHER THEY ARE THE
MOST EFFECTIVE POSSIBLE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT RELATIVELY LITTLE CHANGE HAD
TAKEN PLACE IN THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES OF THESE LIBRARIES AND THEIR BOOK
SELECTION METHODS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION AND THAT INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL
LIBRARIANS IN BOOK SELECTION WAS NEGLIGIBLE. RURAL LIBRARIES IN COUNTRIES
OUTSIDE SOUTH AFRICA WERE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MODEL AGAINST WHICH TO
MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARIES.
LITERATURE SELECTION AND ACQUISITION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE,
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. AT REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY A CENTRAL ACQUISITIONS
DEPARTMENT COORDINATES ORDERS RECEIVED FROM THE CENTRAL AND SUBJECT LIBRARIES
AND CONTROLS ALL PRE-ACCESSION WORK, FINANCE AND BUDGETING. A BALANCE OF
CENTRALISED AND DECENTRALISED TASKS PROVES SUCCESSFUL. THE CENTRAL
ACQUISITIONS DEPARTMENT FINDS INFORMATION ON DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LITERATURE
AND SENDS THIS TO THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS. LITERATURE SELECTION IS MADE JOINTLY
BY THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS AND THE FACULTIES. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIAN TRACES
MISSING BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS FOR THE ACQUISITIONS DEPARTMENT. GERMAN LANGUAGE
MATERIAL IS BOUGHT FROM LOCAL BOOK-SELLERS, FOREIGN MATERIAL FROM A VARIETY OF
SOURCES; GIFTS, EXCHANGES AND DEPOSIT COPIES ALSO PROVIDE USEFUL MATERIAL.
PERIODICALS ARE OBTAINED MAINLY THROUGH DIRECT ORDERING.
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICIES.

A COLLECTION OF ARTICLES AND REPORTS PRODUCED BY COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND OTHER
ORGANISATIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. THE
ORGANISATIONS SELECTED WERE ALL CHOSEN FROM THOSE INVOLVED WITH AMERICAN
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES RELATING TO COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.
THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARIES' BOOK PURCHASES.

FACED WITH CUTS IN BOOK BUDGETS, LIBRARIANS HAVE TO CHOOSE TO WHICH GROUPS OF
USERS THEY SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY' THOSE WHO USE THE LIBRARY MOST, I.E. THOSE
WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, OR THE MINORITY FOR WHOM THE NEED FOR MEANINGFUL
ACTIVITIES BEYOND TV AND WEEKLY MAGAZINES IN A TIME OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS GREAT.
FEARS THAT CUTS ARE MADE, NOT IN THE PULP ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE BUT IN
BOOKS BY QUALITY AUTHORS. INSTEAD OF DEFENDING WHAT IS CULTURALLY VALUABLE,
LIBRARIANS GIVE IN TO POPULAR DEMAND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH LOAN FIGURES.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARY PURCHASES
DEMONSTRATES THIS' WELL REVIEWED QUALITY BOOKS ARE BOUGHT IN SMALL NUMBERS,
WHEREAS MULTIPLE COPIES ARE BOUGHT OF ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE, DESPITE
LUKEWARM REVIEWS.
MODELING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT BEHAVIOUR' A PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.

DESCRIBES A MODEL FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITHIN BOTH
SPECIFIC COLLECTIONS AND LIBRARY SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE AND SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE
THE FULL RANGE AND COMPLEXITY OF RELEVANT FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE MODEL
PRESENTED IS NOT NOW QUANTIFIABLE IN ALL ITS DIMENSIONS, ITS ANALYSIS IS SEEN
AS LEADING TOWARDS BETTER MODELS FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IN TURN
WILL ALLOW MORE USEFUL PLANS AND PROJECTIONS.
SELECTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIALS AND ACQUISITION POLICY' GENERAL
PROBLEMS.

DISCUSSES THE SITUATION IN LATIN AMERICA'S UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. EXAMINES THE STATE OF EDUCATION
IN GENERAL, WHERE HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED USUALLY AT THE EXPENSE
OF THE ELEMENTARY STAGES; LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS BENEFITED ACCORDINGLY, BUT
ALTHOUGH SOME UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ARE ADEQUATELY RESOURCED, RATIONALISATION
AND PLANNING OF FUTURE POLICIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAXIMISE USE OF RESOURCES.
HENCE LIBRARIANS SHOULD DEVELOP DEFINITE SELECTION AND ACQUISITION POLICIES
USING THE ADVICE OF SPECIALISTS, AND DISREGARDING RESTRICTIONS OF RESOURCES BY
AUTHORITIES UNAPPRECIATIVE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES IN PROMOTING CULTURE
AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE PUBLIC: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH
CONFERENCE OF THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.

THE CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COLLEGE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA,
WAIGANI, PORT MORESBY, 18-19 OCT 79. PAPERS ARE IN 5 SECTIONS: STRATEGIES IN
THE PLANNING OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES; STATE OF LIBRARIES FOR THE
PUBLIC IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA; LITERACY AND THE LIBRARY; REACHING OUT: ACCESS TO
LIBRARY-BASED INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE RURAL AREAS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA; AND
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN INFORMATION WORK. TRANSCRIPTIONS OF QUESTION AND ANSWER
SESSIONS ARE ALSO INCLUDED.
SURVEY OF CZECH AND SLOVAK PERIODICALS AND BULLETINS ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND
INFORMATICS.

MORE THAN 20 PERIODICALS, NEWSLETTERS AND OTHER PAPERS DEALING WITH THE THEORY
AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ARE LISTED. THE SLOVAK
CITATEL' AND ITS CZECH COUNTERPART CTENAR NOW CATER FOR LIBRARIES IN GENERAL.
ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN MIND. OTHER PERIODICALS
ARE MORE SPECIALISED, DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMIC LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES IN INDUSTRY; IN UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
ESTABLISHMENTS. THEIR EDITORIAL STAFF MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO IMPART INFORMATION
TO THEIR READERS, NOT ONLY ON LIBRARY ROUTINES AND TECHNIQUES, BUT ALSO SOME
INSIGHT INTO THE READERS PSYCHOLOGY, THE SITUATION IN A SIMILAR FIELD ABROAD,
THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS, IMPORTANT EVENTS OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE LIKE. A
SPECIAL NEWSLETTER TAKES UP CONSTRUCTION OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS , THEIR
FURNISHING AND EQUIPMENT, BOOK COLLECTIONS AND CATALOGUING. ALTHOUGH SLOVAK
TRADE UNIONS AS WELL AS MUSEUM AND AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES STILL LACK
PERIODICALS OF THEIR OWN, THE CHOICE IS WIDE AND NO LIBRARIAN AND/OR
INFORMATION SCIENTIST NEED BE BEHIND THE TIMES.
INDIAN LIBRARY SCIENCE LITERATURE.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO INDIA. THE 10 MOST RELIABLE INDIAN
LIBRARY SCIENCE JOURNALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH WERE SELECTED AND THEIR CONTENTS
FROM 1974-76 ANALYSED AND APPRAISED. 499 ARTICLES MET THE SELECTION CRITERIA:
92% WERE CONSIDERED TO BE DESCRIPTIVE ONLY, AND THE REMAINDER WERE JUDGED TO
BE RESEARCH ARTICLES. 90 ARTICLES WERE CONCERNED WITH INFORMATION SCIENCE, 82
WITH THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, AND 45 WITH LIBRARY EDUCATION AND
RESEARCH. THE VOLUME OF LIBRARY SCIENCE LITERATURE IN ENGLISH AND PUBLISHED IN
INDIA RANKS ONLY AFTER THAT PUBLISHED IN THE USA AND UK.
ZZZZ.

1ST ISSUE OF A NEW JOURNAL DEVOTED TO AUTOMATION, BUILDINGS AND TECHNOLOGY IN

YEARS OF CITATEL'.ON

THE EVE OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY, THE MAIN POINTS OF THE PERIODICAL'S HISTORY
ARE OUTLINED. IT WAS FOUNDED WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ASSISTING STAFF IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. WITH TIME, ITS IMPACT HAS SPREAD TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES,
IN PARTICULAR IN SLOVAKIA. LIBRARIANS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF NEW, INVENTIVE
IDEAS, BOTH FROM HOME AND ABROAD. THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE
SOVIET UNION HAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED SPECIAL ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE EDUCATIONAL
ROLE OF CITATEL' HAS BEEN EMPHASISED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE, THERE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ENOUGH SPACE ON ITS PAGES TO ADVISE LIBRARIANS OF IMPROVEMENT IN
WORKING CONDITIONS, AND TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LIBRARIES.
TODAY, CITATEL' IS WELL ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BUT IT ALSO
HAS A GOOD REPUTATION ABROAD, AND INTEREST IN IT IS ON THE INCREASE.
RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS: ONE UNIVERSITY'S APPROACH.

EXPANDS UPON A PAPER PRESENTED BY JENKINS AT THE STAFF DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS OF
LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES DISCUSSION GROUP, AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
MIDWINTER MEETING, CHICAGO, JAN 80. IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON
PUBLISHED RESEARCH BY ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, DISCUSSES EFFORTS AT THE MORRIS
LIBRARY, SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY AT CARBONDALE, TO ENCOURAGE GREATER
INVOLVEMENT IN THIS AREA. DESCRIBES THE LIBRARY'S FACULTY DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE RESEARCH INTEREST GROUP DESIGNED TO ENABLE
LIBRARIANS TO DISCUSS AND EVALUATE THEIR RESEARCH IDEAS.
RESEARCH IN LIBRARIES-SOME STEPS FOR ACTION.

THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF LIBRARY/DOCUMENTATION/INFORMATION SCIENCE IN INDIA
IS NOW IN THE FINAL PHASE-SELF-SUFFICIENCY. IDENTIFIES THE AREAS COVERED BY
THIS DISCIPLINE; BRIEFLY TRACES THE GROWTH OF LIBRARIES IN THE PRE-RANGANATHAN
AND RANGANATHAN ERAS; AND HIGHLIGHTS THE PROFESSION'S PRESENT POSITION,
INCLUDING ITS DEVALUATION THROUGH LOW PAY AND STATUS. LOOKS AT THE RESEARCH
POTENTIAL IN LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTIES AND IN LIBRARIES. PLEADS FOR SUBJECT
SPECIALISATION AMONG LIBRARY STAFF; SUGGESTS WORKSHOPS TO ESTABLISH WORK LOAD
AND STANDARDS IN LIBRARIES; AND CALLS FOR THE FORMATION OF AN INSTITUTE OF
ADVANCED STUDIES IN LIBRARY SCIENCE TO START AND COORDINATE RESEARCH.
INAUGURAL LECTURES AND MASTER'S AND DOCTORAL RESEARCH AT SOUTH AFRICAN
UNIVERSITIES.

LISTS, FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, TITLES OF INAUGURAL LECTURES;
MASTER'S THESES AND DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS ACCEPTED IN 1968-80; AND CURRENT
RESEARCH PROJECTS FOR MASTER'S AND DOCTORAL DEGREES.
MY RAMBLING RECOLLECTIONS AND REMARKS AS A LIBRARIAN.

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS ON LIBRARIANSHIP BY THE DIRECTOR OF
THE PHARR MEMORIAL LIBRARY, TEXAS.
THE PERMANENT COLLECTION' PROTECTING THE ESTHETIC AND INTELLECTUAL VALUE OF
RESOURCES.

SURVEYS THE DISPARATE ROLES PLAYED IN THE LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL WORLD BY
LIBRARIANS, CURATORS, INFORMATION SPECIALISTS, ARCHIVISTS AND RECORD MANAGERS,
AND DISCUSSES PROBLEMS THAT THIS ABUNDANCE OF ROLES CREATES.
FOR GOOD OR EVIL, LIBRARIANSHIP IS STERILE.

LIBRARIANS FAIL TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THEIR RANKS; THEY ARE NEITHER
INVENTIVE NOR INNOVATIVE, THERE IS TOO LITTLE IN LIBRARIANSHIP TO JUSTIFY EVEN
A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
NOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN
LOGIC.
THE FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE. PART 3. QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS'
OBJECTIVE MAPS AND SUBJECTIVE LANDSCAPES.

THE METRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION SPACE ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF
PHYSICAL SPACE. AN ABSTRACT MODEL IS USED TO SHOW THAT INFORMATION SPACE IS
LIKE THAT OF LANDSCAPES AND SKYSCRAPERS. AS INDIVIDUALS WE LEARN VERY EARLY TO
CORRECT THE DISTORTIONS THAT SUBJECTIVE APPEARANCES IMPOSE ON US BUT TRACES OF
THIS PROCESS ARE SHOWN BY COSMOLOGICAL HISTORY. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE SUPPORTED
BY OTHER EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT INFORMATION QUANTITIES SHOULD BE MEASURED
LOGARITHMICALLY. FOR PARTS 1 AND 2 SEE 81/1828 AND 81/1829. FOR PART 4 SEE THE
FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBER:.
THE FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE. PART IV. INFORMATION SCIENCE' THE
CHANGING PARADIGM.

THE ARGUMENTS OF PARTS I-III ARE APPLIED TO 2 MAIN ISSUES' (1) SEPARATION OF
THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL COMPONENTS OF INFORMATION PHENOMENA, ILLUSTRATED BY A
DISCUSSION OF PERIODICAL AGEING; AND (2) THE ROLE OF BRADFORD'S LAW AND
RANKING TECHNIQUES AS A MEANS OF EXPLOITING ALL THE INFORMATION INHERENT IN
THE RAW DATA. CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF A PROPOSED NEW KIND OF DATA
BASE IN WHICH OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS STRUCTERED INTO OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.
FOR PART 1 AND 2 SEE 81/1828 AND 81/1829. FOR PART 3 SEE THE PREVIOUS
ABSTRACT.
EMMORPHOSIS' INFORMATION AS PROCESS.

A MODEL OF INFORMATION AS THE PROCESS OF REDUCING UNCERTAINTY (EMMORPHOSIS) IS
PROPOSED AS A MEANS OF EXPLORING AND EXPANDING THE DEFINITIONS OF INFORMATION
SCIENCE BY PROVIDING A NON-TRADITIONAL VIEW OF ITS CENTRAL CONCEPT. OUTLINES
SEVERAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE MODEL AND CALLS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO
THE MECHANISMS AS WELL AS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROCESS.
THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN IN HIS FIELD AND THE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.

ARGUES THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD EMPLOY SPECIALISED PERSONNEL TO EXPAND
LIBRARY INVOLVEMENT IN THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE
COMMUNITY. BEFORE 1960, LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARIES PROVIDED ONLY LIMITED
SERVICES TO A MINORITY OF USERS; WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
SPECIALISED TRAINING, THE LIBRARIAN MUST MEET THE CHALLENGE OF RESPONDING TO
THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION NEEDS OF ALL CITIZENS, AND COMBAT THE
COMPETITION BOOKS FACE FROM OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. OUTLINES RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARIES AND THE PROFESSION, AND PRESENTS A VIEW OF THE
LIBRARY IN THE COMING DECADES AS AN AGENT IN THE PROMOTION OF READING, THE
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, AND SOCIO-CULTURAL CHANGE.
COLLEGE LIBRARIANS IN INDIA.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO INDIA. EXPOSES THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS
LIBRARIES IN INDIA AS A WHOLE ALTHOUGH AIMED PRIMARILY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
LIBRARY SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DELHI IN 1947, THERE HAS BEEN NO
SPECIALISATION IN THE COURSE CONTENT-THERE IS NO SPECIAL COURSE IN COLLEGE
LIBRARIANSHIP. THE COLLEGE LIBRARIAN IS STILL MADE ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY LOSS,
AND EQUALITY OF STATUS AND PAY WITH ACADEMIC STAFF HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED.
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS IN BANGLADESH.

DISCUSSION OF THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS IN BANGLADESH.
LIBRARIANS MUST SHOW GREATER UNITY AND WORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN ORDER TO MAKE A MAXIMUM IMPACT ON GOVERNMENTS AND THE
VARIOUS TYPES OF USER OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES.
REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SWISS LIBRARIANS 1980-81.

INFORMATION IS GIVEN ON MEMBERS' MOVEMENTS AND ON THE ASSOCIATION'S FINANCES.
THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, THE
INCREASING USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, THE NEW
COPYRIGHT LAWS, THE PROPOSED LAW ON RESEARCH AND CONTACT WITH OTHER
LIBRARIANSHIP ORGANISATIONS. REPORTS ARE INCLUDED FROM STAFF ORGANISATIONS,
FROM STUDY GROUPS ON' UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES; EDUCATION LIBRARIES; PUBLIC
LIBRARIES; FRENCH-SWISS LIBRARIES, AND FROM COMMITTEES ON' EXAMINATIONS; BERNE
TRAINING COURSES; FRENCH-SWISS TRAINING COURSES; ZURICH TRAINING COURSES;
ADVANCED TRAINING; STATISTICS; PUBLICITY; DICTIONARY CATALOGUING; COPYRIGHT;

LIBRARY USE.
THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN 1980.

THE WORKING GROUP ON PROVINCIAL LIBRARIES LEFT A PROPOSAL WITH THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION FOR THE REFORM OF THE RELEVANT SECTION OF THE LIBRARY LEGISLATION.
THE BOOKMOBILE WORKING GROUP HAD ITS BOOKMOBILE STANDARD PUBLISHED BY
KIRJASTOPALVELU OY. THE WORKING GROUP BECAME A PERMANENT GROUP OF THE
ASSOCIATION IN 1981. A MEMORANDUM ABOUT LIBRARY STAFF CONDITIONS WAS SENT TO
THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. SUPPORT GRANTS WERE GIVEN FOR THE 1ST TIME FOR THE
SELECTIVE ACQUISITION OF BOOKS WITH A NARROW CIRCULATION. THE FINNISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION NOW OWNS ABOUT 90% OF THE SHARES OF KIRJASTOPALVELU OY. THE
CIRCULATION OF KIRJASTOLEHTI WAS 7,500. MANY OTHER PUBLICATIONS WERE
PUBLISHED.
THE PROPOSED PLAN OF THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION FOR 1982.

THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS FOR ACTION BY THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ARE'
REFORM OF LIBRARY LEGISLATION; IMPROVED STAFF CONDITIONS; COMMUNICATION
NETWORKS; IMPROVED SCHOOL LIBRARIES; AND THE FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST. THE
PERMANENT COMMITTEES OF THE ASSOCIATION WILL CARRY ON WITH THEIR WORK AS WILL
THE PERMANENT SECTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION IS ASKING TAMPERE
UNIVERSITY TO ORGANISE A COURSE ON NEW COMMUNICATIONS AND LIBRARIES. SOME OF
THE OTHER PROPOSED COURSES ARE LIBRARY LEGISLATION, AND LITERATURE OF THE
MIDDLE EAST. MANY PUBLICATIONS ARE DUE IN 1982. THE ASSOCIATION IS APPLYING
FOR A GRANT OF 385,000 FMARKS FOR NEXT YEAR.
THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH LIBRARY AND LITERATURE
CENTRE) MEMBERS' MEETING, 11TH DECEMBER 1980' A PERSONAL IMPRESSION.

REPORT OF THE MEETING OF NBLC MEMBERS IN AMSTERDAM, 11 DEC 80. TOPICS
DISCUSSED INCLUDED CUTBACKS IN FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE NETHERLANDS, RAISING OF LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP
CHARGES, AND REDUCTION OF THE AGE-LIMIT FOR FREE LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP. ALTHOUGH
MANY OF THOSE PRESENT WERE OPPOSED TO A REDUCTION IN LIBRARY SERVICES SOME
FELT THAT THE GROWTH OF RECENT YEARS, IF ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, COULD LEAD TO A
REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY OF SERVICES. THE QUESTION OF ALLOWING THE PUBLIC A
GREATER VOICE IN THE RUNNING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE POSITION OF UNPAID
VOLUNTARY STAFF WERE ALSO DISCUSSED.
INTEGRATING EDUCATION IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.

CITIES' ASSEMBLY OF NRW IN DUISBURG. A TOTAL OF 18 MILLION BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE
IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NRW FOR A POPULATION OF 17 MILLION. THIS DOES NOT
COMPARE WELL WITH FIGURES OF 5, 6 OR EVEN 8-10 BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION IN
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE TARGET FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NRW IS 2 BOOKS
PER HEAD BUT EVEN THIS FIGURE WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IN THE FACE OF
RISING BOOK COSTS AND A STATIC ACQUISITION BUDGET. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL
NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES IN THE LARGER TOWNS THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS UNEVENLY
DISTRIBUTED AND HARDLY EXISTS AT ALL IN SOME COUNTRY AREAS. THE LIBRARIANS
HAVE PUT FORWARD SUGGESTIONS FOR A LIBRARY LAW AIMED AT IMPROVING THE
SITUATION TO THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION.

PROVINCE, WHILST IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES LIBRARIES STAFFED WITH UNPAID
VOLUNTEERS WERE FORMED, OFTEN WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH
AUTHORITIES. FOLLOWING THE FORMATION IN 1917 OF THE VERENIGING VOOR OPENBAAR
LEESZAALWEZEN IN FRIESLAND (ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC READING ROOMS IN FRIESLAND)
A REGULAR DELIVERY OF BOOK BOXES WAS ORGANISED BY THE TOWN LIBRARIES FOR THE
LOCAL COMMUNITY LIBRARIES. THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE THERE ARE NOW SOME 180,000
REGISTERED PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS, REPRESENTING MORE THAN 30% OF THE POPULATION,
AND LOANS TOTAL SOME 8 MILLION ANNUALLY.
STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES' REACTIONS TO A REPORT (PART) 2.

PART 1 OF THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN SAMENLEVING 9 (2) FEB 81,
46-51 (SEE 81/5155). THE GUIDELINES FOR STANDARDS OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE
PUBLISHED IN 1980 IN THE NETHERLANDS BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE COORDINATION OF
STANDARDS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CONTAIN NO DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND TO
THE SUGGESTED STANDARDS. SOME SECTIONS OF THE REPORT CONTAIN CONSIDERABLY
GREATER DETAIL THAN OTHERS, WHICH GIVES THE REPORT AN UNBALANCED APPEARANCE.
IT IS ALSO NOTEWORTHY THAT NO STANDARDS FOR STAFFING ARE INCLUDED. IN
COMPARISON WITH THE IFLA STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND THOSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE
STANDARDS HERE PROPOSED ARE SOMEWHAT LOW. ONLY EXPERIENCE IN PRACTICAL USE CAN
SHOW WHETHER THEY ARE ADEQUATE.

THE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, CONTRIBUTE ROUGHLY 6% OF
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S POPULATION. TO THIS END, THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AT POPRAD,
(SLOVAKIA), HELD IN MAY 81 DEALT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE LECTURES GIVEN SHOWED A GOOD THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
VERY OFTEN MORE ADVANCED THAN THE PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THE
HANDICAPPED AND DISABLED. LIBRARIANS CAN INFLUENCE THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S
ATTITUDE TO THEIR HANDICAPPED FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS
MADE SOME USEFUL SUGGESTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, ADJUSTMENT OF LIBRARY EQUIPMENT FOR
THE HANDICAPPED, DEVELOPMENT OF READING AIDS FOR BEDRIDDEN PEOPLE AND THE
LIKE, AND THERE WAS ALSO AN APPEAL TO THE PRESS FOR FULL COVERAGE OF THESE AND
MANY OTHER PROBLEMS FACING THE HANDICAPPED IN THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF
THE DISABLED.
THE HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES.

THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF
AVAILABLE AIDS AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES. SOCIETY CREATES THE HANDICAP BY
MAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY
AND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVING
CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WAS
SHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONG
TEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THE
LIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATE
DOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS AND
PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.
INFORMATION SERVICES TO DISABLED INDIVIDUALS.

FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
ARCHITECTURAL AND PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY' A REVIEW OF LIBRARY PROGRAMS,
FACILITIES AND PUBLICATIONS FOR LIBRARIANS SERVING DISABLED INDIVIDUALS.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE SOCIAL, ATTITUDINAL, AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS THAT HAVE
HISTORICALLY CONFRONTED HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; OUTLINES RELEVANT LEGISLATION; AND
LISTS MAJOR PUBLICATIONS AND RESOURCES OF INTEREST TO LIBRARIANS.
MAKE LIBRARIES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!.

6 YEARS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ON A NEW CULTURAL POLICY, NO PROPOSALS FOR
SUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FOR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN AND
PRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CAN
REACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECT
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACH
NEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIR
PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATE
LIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THE
BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH
MATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.
LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN MALAYSIA.

REPORTS ON A UNESCO PROJECT CONCERNED WITH THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN
MALAYSIA TO REVIEW PRESENT SERVICES, SET UP A MODEL FOR A SERVICE AT THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY, KUALA LUMPUR, RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS TO PRESENT SERVICES AND
ORGANISE A SEMINAR. ONLY 8,000 OF AN ESTIMATED 40,000 BLIND IN WEST MALAYSIA
ARE REGISTERED AS THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO DO SO. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY HOPES
TO HAVE A SECTION FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED WHEN ITS NEW BUILDING IS READY
IN 1983, BUT SOME LARGE PRINT BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE ALREADY. MALAYSIA HAS 4
SOCIETIES FOR THE BLIND. THE MALAYAN ASSOCIATION IN KAULA LUMPUR PRODUCES AND
LENDS BRAILLE BOOKS TO REGISTERED USERS. TALKING BOOKS ARE PRODUCED BY ST.
NICHOLAS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND IN PENANG. MOST MATERIAL IS IN ENGLISH, BUT IT
IS HOPED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF BOOKS IN MALAY AT THE EXPENSE OF
ENGLISH, AS THE LATTER MATERIAL CAN BE BORROWED FROM ABROAD.
THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE.

THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (TPB) WAS ESTABLISHED ON 1 JAN 80
WHEN THE STATE TOOK OVER THE LIBRARY ACTIVITIES OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE BLIND.
THE 1ST LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND HAD BEGUN IN 1892, AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF TAPES
THE SOCIETY BEGAN LENDING TALKING BOOKS IN 1955, NOW AS CASSETTES THE DOMINANT
MEDIUM. FROM THE START THE BOOKS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE
BOOKS ARE SOLD AT COST PRICE BY THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
THE PROVISION WAS THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL REPORTS, ABOVE ALL THE HANDICAP
COMMISSION'S REPORT CULTURE FOR ALL, 1976. DIRECT LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS FROM
TPB ARE FALLING, AND THE LIBRARY'S ROLE AS CENTRE FOR LOANS OF DEPOSIT
COLLECTIONS IS GROWING. THE LIBRARY, WHICH IS LED BY 7 STATE APPOINTEES, HAS
UNITS FOR PRODUCTION, LENDING, EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL, DEVELOPMENT AND
INFORMATION.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE GROWTH OF VENEZUELA'S 1ST CHILDREN'S LIBRARY, DESCRIBING
SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES, SPECIAL PROGRAMMES, COLLABORATION WITH SCHOOLS, AND
THE EVENTS PLANNED TO CELEBRATE ITS ANNIVERSARY.
INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.

THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF LIBRARIANS, BUT IT SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MODERN TEACHING
PROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON A
RUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYING
LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGER
ADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
AND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO
3767/1979 WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3 ROLES' SUPPLYING
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TO
THE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;
EDUCATING BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS TO USE INFORMATION SOURCES INDEPENDENTLY
DURING INDIVIDUAL STUDY, CAREER SELECTION AND LEISURE. ACQUISITION MUST PLACE
GREATER EMPHASIS ON SCIENTIFIC, TE CHNICAL AND OTHER SUBJECT ORIENTED BOOKS.
LIBRARY USER BEHAVIOR.

THE STUDY IS DIVIDED INTO 4 SECTIONS' (1) USER ATTRIBUTES; (2) ANALYSIS OF
USER'S PERCEPTION OF WHICH SOURCES ARE MOST LIKELY TO PROVIDE THE DESIRED
INFORMATION AS WELL AS HIS/HER SEARCH STRATEGY; (3) USER'S PREFERENCE FOR A
PARTICULAR SOURCE VERSUS HIS/HER ACCEPTANCE OF ANY MATERIAL AS LONG AS IT WILL
FURNISH THE DATA NEEDED; (4) IMPACT OF MASS MEDIA, AND TELEVISION IN
PARTICULAR, ON INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOUR.

IN MANY LIBRARIES IS LOW; (2) USE WITHIN THE LIBRARY PARALLELS CIRCULATION;
(3) PAST USE PREDICTS FUTURE USE; (4) RECENT MATERIALS ARE USED MORE
FREQUENTLY; AND (5) AMERICANS USE FEW FOREIGN-LANGUAGE MATERIALS. DISCUSSES
PROBLEMS OF MEASUREMENT AND INTERPRETATION.
AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILIZATION METHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS.

A RECENT EVALUATION OF CURRENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE USE OF LIBRARIES
CANNOT BE COMPARED; BUT, THE USE OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS CAN BE COMPARED IF THE
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COLLECTIONS ARE THE SAME. THE REASONING BEHIND THIS THESIS
IS PROVIDED ALONG WITH AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT COLLECTION UTILISATION
METHODOLOGIES AND FINDINGS. A SET OF VARIABLES THAT ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN
COMPARATIVE STUDIES IS ALSO PROVIDED.
THE RANGES OF LIFE INTERESTS AND READING INTERESTS AMONG ADULT USERS OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES IN COMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES.

(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.) DESCRIBES A
QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF USERS OF 6 ILLINOIS PUBLIC LIBRARIES SERVING
COMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES TEND
TO SERVE THE MORE EDUCATED, THE YOUNG, AND WHITE COLLAR WORKERS, WHO WERE
INTERESTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS. DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARY
ACQUISITION POLICIES AND MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN RELATED
AREAS.
THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USER
BEHAVIOR.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'
PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2)
AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4)
PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4 DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-A
DICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OF
USE AND 2-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2 DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1 USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;
TYPE 2-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202 RESIDENTS OF
SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THE
LIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TO
AWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSE
USE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.
THE SUBJECT INTENSITY OF LIBRARY USE' SOME ASPECTS OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY USE.

STUDIES OF SEVERAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY USE IN POLYTECHNICS ARE REPORTED. ISSUES
WERE INVESTIGATED IN 3 POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF
LIBRARY PROVISION, AND ANALYSED IN TERMS OF SIZE AND NOVELTY OF STOCK. NEWER
STOCK WAS FOUND TO BE PREFERRED ALMOST UNIVERSALLY, AND LARGER STOCKS WERE
MORE HEAVILY USED.
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS USAGE IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY' THE CASE STUDY FROM IBADAN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

EXAMINES USAGE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS FOR RESEARCH AT IBADAN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, NIGERIA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUCH DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE A
SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE MATERIALS USED FOR RESEARCH AND THAT STATISTICAL
PUBLICATIONS ARE THE MOST FREQUENTLY CONSULTED MATERIALS.
DOCUMENTATION AND LITERARY RESEARCH.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES
PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, DISTINGUISHING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE
LITERARY RESEARCHER FROM OTHER USER NEEDS. DISCUSSES IN DETAIL THE KIND OF
DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED, AND SHOWS HOW THE NOTIONS OF OBSOLESCENCE AND
EXHAUSTIVITY ARE LARGELY IRRELEVANT. TO MEET THESE SPECIFIC NEEDS, QUEBEC
SHOULD ESTABLISH A UNION CATALOGUE OF RESEARCH RESOURCES AND A NATIONAL
RESEARCH LIBRARY; HERE THE COMPUTER IS NOT THE SOLUTION.
LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.

THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY AND
EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANY
UNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATION
AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAK
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES
1-3 YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1-10 YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION
SERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
REVOLUTION.
USER SATISFACTION IN THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY.

A USER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY TO DETERMINE
THE DEGREE OF USER SATISFACTION AND IDENTIFY LIMITING FACTORS. ANALYSIS OF
DATA FROM 203 DATA SHEETS COMPLETED BY PATRONS REQUESTING SPECIFIC TITLES
REVEALS THAT ACQUISITIONS BY THE LIBRARY AND USER ERROR ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT
LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGS
OF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE OR
SEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONS
POLICY. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF USER ERROR INDICATES A LACK OF ADEQUATE
LIBRARY SEARCHING TECHNIQUES, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDED
FOR POTENTIAL USERS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS LIBRARY ORIENTATION PROGRAMMES AND
SIGNS ALERTING THEM TO COMMONLY COMMITTED ERRORS OF THE LOCATION OF SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABL E FROM NTIS.
SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.

ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSE
SCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALL
STANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APART
FROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS A
PERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE A
GREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATION
SOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIR
PRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATER
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFT
WORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES AND
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREA
OF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.
CRISIS-CENTRED, ISSUE-BASED' THE LONELINESS OF DISTANCE LEARNING.

ARGUES THAT UK LIBRARIES AND THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION CONTINUING
EDUCATION HAVE THE SAME STAPLE CUSTOMER GROUP. AS PROVISION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY
ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES DROPS AND BUDGET CUTS BITE DEEP EVERYWHERE, IT WOULD
BENEFIT BOTH ORGANISATIONS TO COOPERATE AND MAINTAIN A 'HIGH PROFILE'. FOR
THEIR PART, LIBRARIES SHOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS IN
ADULT EDUCATION RATHER THAN AS SERVICING AGENTS; AGGRESSIVELY MARKET MATERIALS
ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES; AND USE THEIR CLOSENESS TO THE
COMMUNITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE THE WORKING CLASS. WITH ITS 4,500 OUTLETS, THE
UK LIBRARY SYSTEM IS A SLEEPING COMMUNITY EDUCATION GIANT-THE GIANT MUST
AWAKE.

BIBLIOTHERAPY AND THE DISABLED.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE EVOLUTION AND PRACTICE OF BIBLIOTHERAPY IN THE USA AND THE
IMPLICATIONS OF ITS USE FOR LIBRARIANS AS WELL AS FOR THE DISABLED.
AN IN-DEPTH COLLECTION EVALUATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA LIBRARY' A
TEST OF THE LOPEZ METHOD.

A COLLECTION-EVALUATION TECHNIQUE OFFERING A QUICK, EFFICIENT MEANS OF
OBTAINING AN EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE COLLECTION IN SPECIFIC
SUBJECT AREAS HAS BEEN TESTED TWICE ON 4 DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA LIBRARY SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH INCONSISTENCIES RAISE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE'S RELIABILITY, FURTHER ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT
IT DOES CONSTITUTE A VALID TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE DEPTH OF THE COLLECTION.
WHAT MY PUPILS TAUGHT ME ABOUT CHILDREN'S BOOKS.

REPORT ON A STUDY BY A SUSSEX JUNIOR-SCHOOL LIBRARIAN OF THE LIBRARY'S POLICY
OF BOOK PROVISION. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PRESENTED TO 90 CHILDREN IN A LOCAL
MIDDLE SCHOOL ON THEIR READING INTERESTS. THIS PILOT STUDY ENABLED THE
LIBRARIAN TO ALTER THE RESEARCH DESIGN, NOTABLY BY PROMPTING INCREASED PUPIL
PARTICIPATION AND AN IMPROVED QUESTIONNAIRE. 258 CHILDREN IN THE AUTHOR'S OWN
SCHOOL TOOK A STANDARDISED COMPREHENSION TEST AND COMPLETED THE NEW
QUESTIONNAIRE. A PANEL OF CHILDREN CATALOGUED THE SCHOOL'S 4,793 BOOKS UNDER 2
MAIN CLASSIFICATIONS-FICTION AND INFORMATION, AND SORTED THEM INTO 50
CATEGORIES. DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS WERE TAPED. 1 IN 20 BOOKS WERE ASSESSED
FOR THEIR READABILITY LEVELS. A COMPARISON OF READING AGES AND READABILITY
LEVELS OF THE BOOKS SHOWED EXTENSIVE MISMATCHING OF LITERATURE TO PUPILS.
DETAILED RESULTS ARE PRESENTED AND ANALYSED.
EXPLANATIONS OF THE BIBLIOMETRIC LAWS.

MANY LIBRARIANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH BRADFORD'S LAW OF SCATTERING AS A
DESCRIPTION OF HOW ARTICLES IN A DISCIPLINE ARE DISPERSED OVER THE UNIVERSE OF
JOURNALS. SIMILAR AND EQUALLY SURPRISING REGULARITIES ARE FOUND IN A WIDE
RANGE OF OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS BIOLOGY, ECONOMICS, GEOGRAPHY, AND LINGUISTICS.
DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE LAWS AND REFORMULATES THEM
SO AS TO REVEAL THEIR UNDERLYING SIMILARITY. IT IS NOTED THAT ALL OF THESE
LAWS ARE IN ESSENCE MATHEMATICALLY IDENTICAL. REVIEWS SEVERAL ATTEMPTS THAT
HAVE BEEN MADE TO DERIVE THIS COMMON REGULARITY FROM MORE BASIC PRINCIPLES,
SUCH AS AN UNDERLYING STOCHASTIC PROCESS OR AN INFORMATION THEORETIC MODEL OF
THE HUMAN MIND.
CITATION ANALYSIS' A NEW TOOL FOR THE MODERN LIBRARIAN.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE OF CITATION ANALYSIS, ITS HISTORY, AND ITS USES.
ORGANISATION AND CONTROL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION.

LOOKS AT THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH FACE LIBRARIANS IN THE IDENTIFICATION,
LOCATION AND ACQUISITION OF LOCAL-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. IT SEEKS SOLUTIONS TO
THESE PROBLEMS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. THE
MAIN PART OF THE RESEARCH CONSISTED OF A SERIES OF VISITS TO PLANNING
DEPARTMENTS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN YORKSHIRE, HUMBERSIDE AND CLEVELAND. THE
PURPOSE OF THESE VISITS WAS TO OBTAIN FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL-GOVERNMENT
PRACTICES IN THE PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION. ALSO EXAMINES THE POOR COVERAGE
OF LOCAL-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BY 5 SELECTED ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING SERVICES.
EMBASSY NEWSLETTERS AS INFORMATION SOURCES OF CURRENT AFFAIRS.

EMBASSY NEWSLETTERS CONTAIN POLICY INFORMATION REGARDING POLITICAL,
SOCIOECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL CONDITIONS OF THE ISSUING COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH THEY
CAN BE VIEWED PRIMARILY AS PROPAGANDA MATERIALS, THEY CAN BE USED AS SOURCES
OF INFORMATION ON CURRENT AFFAIRS, ESPECIALLY AS THEY PROVIDE THE MOST RECENT
AND AVAILABLE DATA ON THE ISSUING COUNTRY. IDENTIFIES OVER 30 FOREIGN EMBASSY
NEWSLETTERS AVAILABLE IN THE USA; DESCRIBES METHODS OF ACQUISITION AND
ORGANISATION; AND CITES ADVANTAGES OF MAINTAINING SUCH COLLECTIONS.
THE AMERICAN WEST.

A SPECIAL ISSUE CONTAINING 7 ARTICLES, FOR ABSTRACTS OF WHICH SEE THE
FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS:.
LEGACY OF THE TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS: TEXTUAL AND CARTOGRAPHIC RECORDS OF
WESTERN EXPLORATION, 1819-1860.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON THE AMERICAN WEST. IDENTIFIES AND DISCUSSES
THE MAJOR GUIDES TO THE TEXTUAL AND CARTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTS RELATED TO
EXPLORING EXPEDITIONS BY THE TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS WHO ACCOMPANIED MILITARY
EXPEDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT AGENTS NEGOTIATING WITH INDIAN TRIBES. THE 'TOPOGS'
(AS THEY ARE OFTEN CALLED) MADE SURVEYS; ESTABLISHED BOUNDARY LINES; REPORTED
ON TERRAIN CHARACTER AND PRESENCE OF WOOD, WATER AND FORAGE; AND STUDIED
INDIAN TRIBAL CUSTOMS, NUMBERS, AND LANGUAGES.
THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS IN WESTERN
DEVELOPMENT' COLLECTIVISM VERSUS RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM.

INTRODUCTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON THE US WEST. DISCUSSES THE ROLE PLAYED BY
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN
WEST AND THE RECREATION OF EASTERN CIVILISATION IN THE WESTERN WILDERNESS.
CONTRASTS THIS WITH THE WESTERNERS' HEAVY EMPHASIS ON 'RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM'
AND THEIR FAILURE TO RECOGNISE THE MUTUAL INTERDEPENDENCE OF EAST AND WEST.
THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND CONFLICTS CAN BE TRACED THROUGH GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS
AND ARCHIVES.
SOME RECENT LATIN AMERICAN DOCUMENTS.

DESCRIBES MONOGRAPHIC AND PERIODICAL DOCUMENTS OF RELATIVELY RECENT APPEARANCE
COVERING LATIN AMERICA OR CENTRAL AMERICA AS A REGION, ISSUED BY ORGANISATIONS
IN LATIN AMERICA AND LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO DOCUMENTS LIBRARIANS
CONCERNED WITH LATIN AMERICAN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS. THIS IS THE 2ND
ARTICLE OF THIS TITLE. THE 1ST WAS PUBLISHED IN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS REVIEW
4 (4) 1977, 315-317.
FRENCH IN THE ONTARIO SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN.

IN MANY ENGLISH SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN ONTARIO THE COLLECTION OF
MATERIALS TO SUPPORT THE FRENCH PROGRAMME IS MINIMAL, AND EXPOSURE TO THE
FRENCH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM IS DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE IN
SOME PARTS OF ONTARIO WHERE THERE IS NO LARGE FRENCH POPULATION. EXAMINES THE
SITUATION OF FRENCH IN ONTARIO SCHOOLS AT PRESENT AND TRENDS FOR THE FUTURE,
AND DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS AND MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHERS CAN
COOPERATE, INCENTIVES FOR THE STUDENT, AND TYPES OF MATERIAL WHICH COULD BE
PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARY.
FREE MAGAZINES FOR LIBRARIES.

CLASSIFIED, ANNOTATED GUIDE TO MAGAZINES WHICH FALL INTO THE GENERAL CATEGORY
OF HOUSE MAGAZINES AVAILABLE TO LIBRARIES ON A COMPLIMENTARY BASIS.
ARRANGEMENT IS ALPHABETICAL, BY SUBJECT.
THE ROLE OF BIBLIOMETRY IN JOURNAL SELECTION AND LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.

BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY, BASED ON CITATION ANALYSIS AND RESULTING IN THE
RECOMMENDATION OF 44 MEDICAL PERIODICALS TO WHICH A MODEST MEDICAL LIBRARY IN
A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SHOULD SUBSCRIBE TO FULFIL MOST OF ITS USERS' INFORMATION
NEEDS.
RANGE OF PERIODICALS IN LIBRARIES.

OVER 3,000 PERIODICALS AND ABOUT 250 NEWSPAPERS ARE PUBLISHED IN FINLAND
ANNUALLY. LIBRARY SERVICES AGENCY LTD IS INVESTIGATING THE AVAILABILITY OF
PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 333 PUBLIC LIBRARIES RETURNED
A QUESTIONNAIRE SENT TO THEM BY THE AGENCY OF WHICH 1/3 ARE NOW ANALYSED. A
LIST OF PERIODICALS WITH THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBING LIBRARIES IS GIVEN. THE
SMALLEST SUBSCRIPTION IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY IS 2 PERIODICALS WHILE THE LARGEST
COLLECTION CONTAINS 880 SUBSCRIPTIONS. EACH LIBRARY SHOULD SPEND 10% OF ITS
BOOKFUND ON PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS ACCORDING TO PRESENT REGULATIONS.
JOURNAL ACQUISITION AND COST EFFECTIVENESS IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES' A CASE STUDY.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO INDIA. REJECTS THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF
RANKING PAPERS BY THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THEY ARE CITED OR CONSULTED-THE
ACQUISITIONS COST PER PAGE CONSULTED SHOULD ALSO BE A FACTOR. THE COST OF
ACQUIRING 50% OF THE PERIODICAL LITERATURE SURVEYED WAS LESS THAN 10% OF THE
EXPENDITURE ON PERIODICALS.

DETAIL, AND PROVENANCE INDICATED.
RESOURCES AT THE HARRY S. TRUMAN LIBRARY ON WESTERN ISSUES AND PROGRAMS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE AMERICAN WEST. THE HARRY S. TRUMAN
LIBRARY (INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI) POSSESSES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MANUSCRIPT
MATERIAL ON FEDERAL POLICY TOWARD THE USA'S INDIANS DURING 1945-66 AND ON
WATER POWER AND WATER SUPPLY PROGRAMMES IN THE WESTERN STATES IN 1945-52. IT
ALSO HAS AN IMPORTANT COLLECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS ON MIGRATORY LABOUR,
1950-51, DOCUMENTATION ON THE RELOCATION OF JAPANESE-AMERICANS IN WORLD WAR
II, AND ORAL HISTORY TRANSCRIPTS PERTAINING TO THE 1948 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
IN CALIFORNIA. MUCH OF THIS MATERIAL IS YET TO BE USED BY RESEARCHERS.
NON-BOOK MATERIALS IN LIBRARIES. GUIDELINES FOR LIBRARY PRACTICE.

PREPARED BY PARTICIPANTS IN A STUDY WEEK ON NON-BOOK MATERIALS, HAMILTON, NEW
ZEALAND, MAY 79, AND INTENDED FOR USE IN ALL LIBRARIES, THE GUIDELINES COVER
SELECTION AND ACQUISITION, CATALOGUING, GENERAL HANDLING AND ADMINISTRATION,
MICROFORM, SLIDES, FILMSTRIPS, OVERHEAD PROJECTOR TRANSPARENCIES, VIDEOTAPES,
SOUND RECORDINGS, POSTERS, CHARTS, ORIGINAL WORKS OF ART, REPRODUCTIONS,
PICTURES IN LENDING COLLECTIONS, KITS, PHOTOGRAPHS, AND MAPS, PLANS, AND
TECHNICAL DRAWINGS. ALSO INCLUDES NOTES ON SELECTION AIDS, NON-BOOK MATERIAL
SUPPLIERS, AND EQUIPMENT.
TO READ WITH THE AID OF TECHNOLOGY.

EXAMINES VARIOUS TECHNICAL AIDS TO READING, MOST OF THEM AVAILABLE FREE TO
USERS THROUGH THE REGIONAL AID CENTRES. A READING CORNER FOR PARTIALLY SIGHTED
SHOULD BE ARRANGED IN EVERY LIBRARY, USING CORRECT TABLES AND LIGHTING. AIDS
FOR ENLARGING IMAGES MAY BE 'PASSIVE' AIDS WHICH ONLY ENLARGE, SUCH AS
BINOCULARS, LENSES AND MAGNIFYING GLASSES, OR 'ACTIVE', SUCH AS MAGNIVISION.
THE LATTER IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SYSTEM BY MEANS OF WHICH THE USER CAN
ENLARGE THE TEXT AND IMPROVE THE IMAGE IN VARIOUS WAYS. SYSTEMS WHICH ENABLE
READING BY MEANS OTHER THAN SEEING INCLUDE BRAILLE; TALKING BOOKS ON TAPE;
OPTACON, A MACHINE WHICH TRANSFERS LETTERS TO VIBRATING POINTS; THE KURZWEIL
READING MACHINE, WHICH PRODUCES SYNTHETIC SPEECH FROM A PRINTED TEXT, AT
PRESENT USING ENGLISH LANGUAGE ONLY. OTHER AIDS ARE DEVICES FOR TURNING PAGES
AND PRISM GLASS EYES FOR THOSE IMMOBILE IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE USE OF AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS.

(MLIB DISSERTATION.) EXAMINES THE EXPLOITATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS IN
THE LIBRARIES OF 4 POLYTECHNICS-BRIGHTON, NEWCASTLE, PLYMOUTH AND THAMES. 3
MAIN ELEMENTS ARE INVESTIGATED-ADMINISTRATION, AVAILABILITY, AND MEANS OF
EXPLOITATION. BRIGHTON APPROACHES THE IDEAL SITUATION; NEWCASTLE FULLY
INTEGRATES THE MATERIALS, BUT LOCATION OF SOME EQUIPMENT AFFECTS THEIR USE;
PLYMOUTH'S USER EDUCATION PROGRAMME AIDS EXPLOITATION OF THE COLLECTION; AND
THAMES HAS TOO LITTLE SPACE AND AN INADEQUATE COLLECTION, REFLECTING THE LACK
OF A WHOLEHEARTED APPROACH TO AUDIO-VISUAL PROVISION.
THE FRENCH NATIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL INSTITUTE. AUDIO-VISUAL ARCHIVES' OBJECTIVES
AND DUTIES.

COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT OF THE COLLECTION OF AUDIO-VISUAL ARCHIVES AT THE FRENCH
NATIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL INSTITUTE WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF MATERIAL DEPOSITED BY

OF TREATMENT. THE CONSERVATION PROBLEMS ARE EXAMINED, AND GENERAL SOLUTIONS
USED HITHERTO DISCUSSED. FINALLY CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES IN FRENCH
DEPARTMENTAL AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES ARE OUTLINED AND CONSIDERED. EMPHASISES THE
NECESSITY FOR SPECIALIST TRAINING.
SOME IMPRESSIONS OF CANADIAN MAP LIBRARIANS AND THEIR COLLECTIONS.

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF 4 ONTARIO MAP COLLECTIONS VISITED BY THE AUTHOR-AT THE
UNIVERSITIES OF TRENT, BROCK, AND TORONTO, AND THE NATIONAL MAP COLLECTION IN
OTTAWA. THE VISITS CONFIRMED THAT THE BEST STAFF QUALIFICATIONS ARE COMMON
SENSE, ENTHUSIASM, AND A LOVE OF THE MEDIUM; A NATIONAL MAP COLLECTION NEED
NOT BE HELD BY A NATIONAL LIBRARY; MAP LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES CAN FORM
ADVANTAGEOUS LINKS; THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIFIC MAP CLASSIFICATION CODE; A MAP
LIBRARY'S ACTIVITIES SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COLLECTION SIZE AND USER
NUMBERS; AND ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT OPINIONS IN THE PROFESSION ARE VALUABLE, IT IS
TOO YOUNG A PROFESSION TO ENDURE DISSENT AS VIOLENT AS THAT IN THE USA, WHERE
IT HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO 4 FACTIONS.
THE MORE PRACTICAL MICROFILM-VESICULAR.

THERE IS A TREND TOWARDS THE USE OF NONSILVER MICROFILM. VESICULAR FILM, ONE
OF THESE NONSILVER FILMS, OFFERS CONVENIENCE, A REASONABLE PRICE AND
DURABILITY. EXPLAINS HOW VESICULAR FILM WORKS, DESCRIBES ITS COMPONENTS AND
IMAGE PROPERTIES, AND TELLS HOW IT CAN BE USED. LIBRARIES CAN SAVE MONEY BY
USING VESICULAR MICROFILM, AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A MORE EFFICIENT MEDIUM.

PAPER PRESENTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF RADIO FRANCE INFORMATION SERVICES AT A 1980
CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOUND ARCHIVES. DISCUSSES WHAT
INFORMATION THE CATALOGUE SHOULD PROVIDE TO MEET USER NEEDS, BOTH AS REGARDS
STRUCTURED AND INFORMAL RECORDINGS; FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ESSENTIAL
CATALOGUE FIELDS, AND CLASSIFICATION PRACTICE. USER INTERESTS ARE THEN
DESCRIBED. ORIGINALLY ONLY RADIO PROFESSIONALS USED THE ARCHIVE; NOW IT IS
BEING RECOGNISED AS A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR LINGUISTIC AND SOCIOLOGICAL
RESEARCH, THOUGH PUBLIC ACCESS IS RESTRICTED.
MACHINE-READABLE DATA FILES OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. NEW SOURCES OF
MACHINE-READABLE DATA ON DRUG USE, CRIME AND AGING.

BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF 3 US UNIVERSITY-BASED SPECIAL SUBJECT CENTRES WHOSE
PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO COLLECT, PROCESS, DOCUMENT, AND DISSEMINATE
MACHINE-READABLE DATA FILES FOR SECONDARY ANALYSIS' THE DRUG ABUSE
EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA CENTER (AT THE INSTITUTE OF BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH, TEXAS
CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY, FORT WORTH), THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARCHIVE AND
INFORMATION NETWORK (UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE INTER-UNIVERSITY CONSORTIUM FOR

SOURCE MATERIAL AVAILABLE ON INDIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. ASSESSES THE USEFULNESS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF COLLECTIONS
LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE USA, INCLUDING THOSE HELD BY MISSIONARY SOCIETIES AND
PUBLIC ARCHIVES.
TASTE, CULTURES AND LIBRARIANS' A POSITION PAPER.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES.
INTRODUCTORY PAPER, CONTENDING THAT THE MESSAGES WHICH USERS RECEIVE FROM THE
PRODUCTS OF THEIR CULTURE CONTAIN INFORMATION WHICH AIDS IN THE SENSE-MAKING
PROCESS. INDIVIDUALS CAN CHOOSE THEIR OWN CULTURAL BOUNDARIES RATHER THAN HAVE
THOSE BOUNDARIES IMPOSED UPON THEM. WHILST LIBRARIANS MAY CONCLUDE THAT THEY
DO NOT WISH TO COLLECT POPULAR CULTURE MATERIALS, THEY CANNOT HOPE TO MAKE
CORRECT DECISIONS UNLESS THEY UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF CHOOSING TO
EXCLUDE A SERIES OF INFORMATION RESOURCES OF SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT, THAT ARE
TRANSFERRED BY MEANS OF MEDIA UNFAMILIAR TO MOST LIBRARIES.
LIBRARIES AT THE CROSSROADS: A PERSPECTIVE ON LIBRARIES AND CULTURE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. ANALYSES
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULAR CULTURE AND FORMAL EDUCATION, AND ANTICIPATES
THE GROWTH OF THE FORMER WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE LATTER. THE
WELL-ROUNDED AND PROPERLY-FILLED LIBRARY SHOULD BE A PLACE FOR ALL CITIZENS,
AND PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR PEOPLE TO HANDLE NOT ONLY THE LANGUAGES OF SEEING,
BUT ALSO OF HEARING AND FEELING. THE PROBLEMS AND NEEDS OF PROVIDING SUCH
INFORMATION BEG THE ATTENTION OF THE ENTIRE LIBRARY COMMUNITY.
COLLECTING AND USING POPULAR PHOTOGRAPHS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. EXPLORES
THE VALUE AND POTENTIAL FOR COLLECTING AND ORGANISING A POPULAR PHOTOGRAPH
COLLECTION. BROADLY CATEGORISES 5 TYPES OF LIBRARY (HISTORICAL RESEARCH,
SPECIAL, PUBLIC, SCHOOL AND ACADEMIC), COMMENTING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ART
OF PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTION WITHIN EACH, AND DISCUSSING THEIR CURRENT AWARENESS,
SPECIAL SELECTION PROBLEMS, AND AREAS OF ANTICIPATION OF POTENTIAL USABILITY
OF A POPULAR PHOTOGRAPH ARCHIVE.
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE COLLECTIONS IN FIFTY-FOUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES'
WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT BE.

(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF IOWA.) STUDY OF THE NATURE, SELECTION POLICIES, AND
RANGE AMONG CHILDREN'S LITERATURE COLLECTIONS IN SELECTED US COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES AS THEY NOW EXIST. THE STUDY ASSEMBLES LIBRARIANS' OPINIONS OF
THESE COLLECTIONS ABOUT WHAT AN IDEAL ACADEMIC COLLECTION SHOULD BE, AND
COLLECTS EXPERTS' OPINIONS OF WHAT WOULD BE OPTIMUM STANDARDS OF OPERATION
WITH EMPHASIS ON THE SELECTION OF SUCH COLLECTIONS, THUS MOVING TOWARDS THE
DETERMINATION OF CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING COLLECTIONS.
SOME REFLECTIONS ON CITATION HABITS IN PSYCHOLOGY.

CITATIONS APPEARING IN THE PAGES OF A SINGLE JOURNAL, JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL
PSYCHOLOGY, WERE COUNTED FOR THE YEARS 1960-1979. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED
WITH THOSE FOUND BY USING NETWORKS OF JOURNALS AND WITH THE NUMBER OF
ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED BY PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS DURING THE SAME PERIOD. IN BOTH
CASES THE RESULTS TEND TO SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITATION HABITS
AND THE VOLUME OF LITERATURE AVAILABLE FOR CITING IS NOT VERY CLOSE.
CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION MATERIAL.

EXPLAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF ASCERTAINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INFORMATION
MATERIAL USED BY A DISCIPLINE'S PRACTITIONERS AND POINTS OUT THE DEARTH OF
SUCH WORK IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, PARTICULARLY IN INDIA. PRESENTS AND
DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A STUDY IN WHICH 5,236 CITATIONS FROM 5 INDIAN
SCHOLARLY PERIODICALS (INDIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, QUARTERLY REVIEW OF HISTORICAL
STUDIES, INDIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES, AND
SOCIOLOGICAL BULLETIN) WERE ANALYSED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC FORM, AGE, AND NUMBER
OF PERIODICALS CONTAINING CITED ARTICLES.
THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SWISS SOCIAL SCIENCE ARCHIVE.

THE SWISS SOCIAL SCIENCE ARCHIVE COLLECTS ALL SWISS MATERIAL AND MUCH FROM
ABROAD ON SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE. STOCKS INCLUDE 80,000 BOOKS,
600,000 NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS AND A PAMPHLET COLLECTION OF 500,000 ITEMS. THE
ARCHIVE HAS A KEYWORD INDEX OF 350 TERMS; UDC WAS USED UNTIL 1959, WHEN THE
ARCHIVE INVENTED ITS OWN DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION TO PROVIDE MORE SPECIALISED
COVERAGE. IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY NON-COMMERCIAL MATERIAL
BUT THE ARCHIVE RECEIVES MANY GIFTS OF PRIVATE COLLECTIONS. THE ARCHIVE HAS 12
STAFF AND AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 900,000 FR, INCLUDING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE
TOWN AND CANTON OF ZURICH AND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SWISS SOCIAL
SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION HAS AN IMPORTANT CENTRE HERE AND IS BEING IMPROVED
THROUGH THE ARCHIVE'S WORK WITH OTHER DOCUMENTATION CENTRES.
FEDERAL SOURCES FOR THE STUDY OF COLLECTIVE COMMUNITIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE AMERICAN WEST. ALTHOUGH COMMUNITARIAN
MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN A PART OF US HISTORY SINCE THE COLONIAL PERIOD, THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TENDED TO LEAVE THEM ALONE. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW
CONGRESSIONAL PAPERS USEFUL FOR THE STUDY OF COMMUNES; THE MOST USEFUL SOURCES
ARE THE PUBLICATIONS AND DOCUMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE LIBRARY
OF CONGRESS. DISCUSSES THE GENERAL STATE OF SUCH INFORMATION SOURCES AND
DESCRIBES THE MOST USEFUL ITEMS IN SOME DETAIL.
SCIENCE IN THE MIDDLE-LEVEL COUNTRIES: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC
JOURNALS OF AUSTRALIA, CANADA, INDIA AND ISRAEL.

THE WORLD NATIONS CAN BE CLASSIFIED, IN TERMS OF SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY, INTO
3 GROUPS-ADVANCED, MIDDLE-LEVEL AND PERIPHERAL. SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN TURN
ARE OF 2 KINDS: NATIONAL, REGIONAL OR LOCAL; AND INTERNATIONAL. MOST JOURNALS
PUBLISHED IN MIDDLE-LEVEL COUNTRIES ARE LOCAL JOURNALS. CONSIDERS 95 ENGLISH
LANGUAGE JOURNALS PUBLISHED IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, INDIA AND ISRAEL, INDEXED IN
SCIENCE CITATION INDEX. A CITATION ANALYSIS FOLLOWS. AMONGST THE FINDINGS WERE
THAT MOST OF THE JOURNALS CITE MORE THAN THEY ARE CITED, LOCAL JOURNALS CITE A
GREATER PROPORTION OF OLDER REFERENCES THAN INTERNATIONAL JOURNALS, AND OF THE
4 COUNTRIES CONSIDERED, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA FARE BETTER THAN INDIA.
EVALUATION OF PERIODICALS IN RESPECT OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO PRESENT DAY
RESEARCH ACTIVITY IN THE FIELD OF NEUROSCIENCE.

BASED ON DATA PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL SEMINAR ON HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIES IN
INDIA, BANGALORE, 1980. DESCRIBES THE GROWTH AND INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF
NEUROSCIENCE AND MENTIONS THE PROBLEMS FACED BY THOSE IN NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
CENTRES ATTEMPTING TO SELECT CORE PERIODICALS. PRESENTS THE RANKING LIST OF 47
PERIODICALS, BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF CITATIONS FROM ANNUAL REVIEW OF
NEUROSCIENCE VOL. 2 1979. COMPARES THIS LIST WITH THOSE PREPARED PREVIOUSLY BY
SENGUPTA ON MEDICINE, BIOCHEMISTRY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND PHARMACOLOGY.
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION' SOURCES FOR THE SOUTH AND WEST.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE AMERICAN WEST. SOURCES ON US RURAL
ELECTRIFICATION ARE VOLUMINOUS AND DIVERSE. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES SHOWING THE
SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ORIGINS OF THE HIGHLY-SUCCESSFUL RURAL
ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION (CREATED IN 1935) ARE IN PRIVATE COLLECTIONS,
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES.
SCATTER AND SEEPAGE OF INFORMATION IN ANTENNAS.

EXPLAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDIES RELATING TO SCATTER AND SEEPAGE (OCCURRENCE
OF INFORMATION ABOUT A SUBJECT IN LITERATURE DEVOTED TO AND NOT DEVOTED TO
THAT SUBJECT RESPECTIVELY). PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A STUDY IN
WHICH 3,092 ITEMS ON ANTENNAE COVERED BY THE 1977 ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS
ABSTRACTS WERE ANALYSED FOR AGE, TYPE OF DOCUMENT, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION,
LANGUAGE DISTRIBUTION, AND NUMBER OF AUTHORS. GIVES A RANKING LIST OF 29
PERIODICALS AND THE SUBJECT DISTRIBUTION OF ALL 92 PERIODICALS CONTAINING
ARTICLES ON ANTENNAE COVERED BY THE ABSTRACTING PERIODICAL IN 1977.
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS & THE ART LIBRARIAN: A SELECTED ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
ART AND ART-RELATED DOCUMENTS.

THE BIBLIOGRAPHY IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE, BUT GIVES A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE
DIVERSITY OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS ON ART-RELATED TOPICS, CHOSEN FROM THOSE
DOCUMENTS RECEIVED BY THE GREENVILLE COUNTY LIBRARY, SOUTH CAROLINA. EACH ITEM
IS LISTED WITH ITS SUDOCS AND GPO STOCK NUMBERS.
THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES' AN OVERVIEW WITH A SURVEY OF
SELECTED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND ARCHIVAL MATERIALS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE AMERICAN WEST. THE IDEA OF NATIONAL
PARKS ORIGINATED IN THE US OVER 100 YEARS AGO. EXAMINES THE EVOLUTION OF THIS
UNIQUE CONCEPT AND SUGGESTS SELECTED RESEARCH AIDS, GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND
ARCHIVAL HOLDINGS USEFUL FOR THE FURTHER STUDY OF THE US NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM.
PUBLIC MUSIC LIBRARIES-A STATISTICAL POINT OF VIEW.

AT THE END OF MAR 79 THE 79/80 RAPID STATISTICS CONCERNING PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
WEST GERMANY WERE PUBLISHED. THEY ARE PUBLISHED ANNUALLY BY THE GERMAN LIBRARY
INSTITUTE BUT FROM 1982 THE 'DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSSTATISTIK DBS' WILL BE
PUBLISHING A COMPLETE SET OF STATISTICS. THE SECTION CONCERNING PUBLIC MUSIC
LIBRARIES IN THE CURRENT STATISTICS SHOWS THAT THERE ARE 54 OF THEM AND THAT 2
MORE ARE PLANNED. THE STATISTICS CONCERNING STOCK ARE DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AS
SOME LIBRARIES NOW HAVE NEW METHODS OF CALCULATING STOCK OR OTHERS HAVE THEIR
STOCK INCLUDED IN CENTRAL LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION
THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN STOCK OF ABOUT 2.9% AND THE RATE OF BORROWING
HAS RISEN BY 6.4%. OF THE 40 LIBRARIES WHICH SUPPLIED FIGURES CONCERNING
EXPENDITURE 1/3 HAD NO RISE IN THEIR BUDGET OR EVEN HAD CUTS OF BETWEEN -7%
AND -24%. ALTHOUGH THE REMAINING 2/3 HAD A BUDGET RISE THE TOTAL DROP IN
EXPENDITURE WAS 2.1%.
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUSIC LIBRARIANS, CAMBRIDGE, 4TH AUGUST 1980'

LIBRARIES AND THE PRESERVATION OF AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE DANCE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. ANALYSES
THE INFORMATION CONVEYED BY POPULAR CULTURE DANCE, AND ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES
SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN PRESERVING A RECORD OF ITS EXISTENCE AND IN PROVIDING A
FORUM FOR THIS POPULAR CULTURE ACTIVITY.
THE NETWORK OF DEPARTMENTAL AND FACULTY LIBRARIES OF THE LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC.

THE LIBRARY NETWORK OF THE M.I. KALININ POLYTECHNIC, LENINGRAD, CONSISTS OF 70
DEPARTMENTAL AND FACULTY LIBRARIES. THE NETWORK HAS A TOTAL STOCK OF OVER
170,000 ITEMS. THE STOCK CURRENTLY INCREASES AT A RATE OF 5,000-7,000 ITEMS
PER YEAR. THE HISTORY OF THE NETWORK, WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN 1911, IS REVIEWED
AND ITS PRESENT ORGANISATION AND ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE MAIN LIBRARY OF
THE NETWORK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CENTRALISED ACQUISITION OF STOCK, PREPARATION
OF METHODOLOGICAL AND MANAGERIAL DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING AND SUPERVISION OF
STOCK PROCESSING.
RESOLUTION OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMISSION ON COORDINATION OF THE
ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES.

PRESENTS THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION ON THE STATE OF ORGANISATION OF SPECIAL
ARCHIVES PASSED BY THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMISSION ON COORDINATION OF THE
ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES DURING A MEETING
HELD ON 1 OCT 80.
LIBRARIES AT THE TURNING POINT' ISSUES IN PROACTIVE PLANNING.

PRESENTS AN APPROACH TO PLANNING FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS. RECOGNITION IS
GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PLANNING TAKES PLACE, AND
ALTERNATIVE PHILOSOPHIES OF PLANNING ARE DISCUSSED. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OF THE
FACTORS IN THE LIBRARY WHICH EFFECT THE STYLE OF PLANNING THAT IS USED. A
NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND IMPROVING THE PLANNING OF
CHANGE IN THE LIBRARY SETTING.
THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR
LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BERLIN 1980. THE EUPHORIA FROM LIBRARY PLANNING IN THE 1970S
HAS NOW FADED, LEAVING BEHIND SCEPTICISM AS TO WHETHER THE PLANS CAN BE
CARRIED OUT. LIBRARY PLANNING WITHOUT A LEGAL BASIS IS NOT BINDING; THE LAW
SHOULD PROVIDE A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING THE DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF CONCRETE AIMS. PLANNING STAGES ARE DESCRIBED WITH REFERENCE TO
THE FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF 1972. LIBRARY PLANNING IS
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY; A LOCAL AUTHORITY'S
FINANCIAL CAPACITY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO AVOID COST INFLATION.
LIBRARY PLANS CAN BE REGARDED AS PACEMAKERS ON THE WAY TO A BETTER DEVELOPMENT
OF LIBRARY SERVICES.
DATA ESSENTIAL FOR PLANNING OF THE WORK OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

PLANNING OF LIBRARY SERVICES IS A COMPLEX TASK THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF
WHICH REQUIRES COLLECTION AND EVALUATION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF DATA. DISCUSSES
HOW THESE DATA ARE COLLECTED AND EVALUATED BY THE LIBRARIES OF HIGHER
EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS OF SIBERIA. PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF DATA ON THE
LIBRARY SERVICES REQUIREMENTS OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED
FROM DETAILED QUESTIONNAIRES SENT OUT TO 165 HEADS OF LIBRARIES AND TO 373
MEMBERS OF LIBRARY STAFF. DESCRIBES THE PLANNING METHODS USED BY THE LIBRARY
OF THE SIBERIAN METALLURGICAL INSTITUTE. SUGGESTS THAT THE PLANNING OF LIBRARY
SERVICES PROVIDED BY AN ACADEMIC ESTABLISHMENT CAN BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF ALL
SOCIAL PROCESSES TAKING PLACE AT THE ESTABLISHMENT ARE THOROUGHLY ANALYSED.
SETTING UP OF A MUSIC SECTION: NOTES ON WORKING PROCESSES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES
IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

1ST PART OF THE STUDY DEALING WITH THE SETTING UP OF A MUSIC SECTION IN A
PUBLIC LIBRARY, ENTITLED 'THE LIBRARY AS A DYNAMIC STRUCTURE', INDICATING
SEVERAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BIOLOGICAL SHAPES AND LIVING PROCESSES
OCCURRING IN NATURE. IT MERELY CONCERNS COMPARISONS (IT IS NOT TRYING TO
TRANSFER THE LAWS OF BIOLOGY INTO LIBRARIANSHIP) AND ITS OBJECT IS TO SHOW-IN
THE PLACE OF LONG EXPLANATIONS-THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN AN OPTIMALLY SHAPED
LIBRARY COLLECTION AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING INFLUENCES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
ESPECIALLY IN THE WORLD OF LIBRARY USERS.
THIRD TIME LUCKY IN PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST?.

THE (UK) NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IS TO BE REORGANISED IN 1982 FOR THE THIRD
TIME SINCE THE WAR. THE 1974 CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT AS A HEALTH
CARE COMMUNITY IS TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF THE NEXT REORGANISATION AND MANY
MULTI-DISTRICT AREAS ARE TO BE SPLIT, AMALGAMATED OR REGROUPED. LIBRARIANS
HAVE DEVELOPED LIBRARY SERVICES OF THE NHS AS AN INFORMATION NETWORK, AND MUCH
OF THE COUNTRY IS NOW COVERED BY REGIONAL NETWORKS INCORPORATING NHS AND
MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES. THE NEW DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES MAY DISRUPT OR
CUT SERVICES ALTOGETHER, NHS FAILS FREQUENTLY TO RECOGNISE THE DIRECT
CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE, AND SOME LIBRARIES
COULD COME UNDER THE ADMINISTRATORS OF INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS, ALTHOUGH BOTH THE
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND NHS REGIONAL LIBRARIANS GROUP ADVOCATE ORGANISATION ON
A DISTRICT RATHER THAN AN INSTITUTIONAL BASIS. LIBRARIANS MUST BE SEEN TO BE
CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH CARE AND ACTIVELY CAMPAIGN FOR RECOGNITION WITHIN THE
NHS.
ANALYSIS OF LIBRARY NETWORKS.

THE EMERGENCE OF LIBRARY NETWORKS IS DISCUSSED. MANAGEMENT ISSUES INVOLVING
NETWORK STRUCTURE, ECONOMICS, AND APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ARE
CONSIDERED. A VARIETY OF LIBRARY NETWORK MODELS ARE REVIEWED, INCLUDING BOTH
ANALYTICAL AND SIMULATION MODELS. TYPICAL PROBLEMS IN APPLYING MODELS TO THE
ANALYSIS OF LIBRARY NETWORKS ARE DISCUSSED.
A DECADE OF INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY COOPERATION THROUGH IFLA' A THIRD WORLD
PERSPECTIVE.

A NEW ERA IN INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT BEGAN WITH THE
ESTABLISHMENT AT IFLA'S 37TH CONFERENCE IN 1971 OF A WORKING GROUP ON
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. CHARTS THE INCREASE IN IFLA MEMBERSHIP OVER THE LAST
DECADE. LISTS THE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS GIVEN BY IFLA SECTIONS AND DIVISIONS
IN DEVELOPING PROGRAMMES WHICH MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
THE AGENCIES WHICH SUPPORT IFLA WORK IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND THE
PROGRAMMES THEMSELVES. DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION OF THE DIVISION OF REGIONAL
ACTIVITIES.
LIBRARIES AFTER THE XVI COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS.

PROSPECTS AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAJOR LIBRARY NETWORKS IN SLOVAKIA
ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE PAST DECADE PROVED TO
BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PERIOD IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, A NEW SCHEME FOR A PUBLIC
LIBRARY NETWORK IS ENVISAGED INCLUDING SEVERAL DISTRICT CULTURAL CENTRES AS
WELL AS THE NECESSARY STRUCTURAL CHANGES. IN-SERVICE COURSES FOR INFORMATION
SCIENTISTS MUST BE OFFERED ON A LARGER SCALE THAN BEFORE AND THE COOPERATION
OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES SHOULD
BE STRENGTHENED. YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELPED BY SCHOOL LIBRARIES WHICH OUGHT
TO BE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE WHOLE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS STARTING AT PRIMARY
SCHOOLS. MANUAL WORKERS, LABOURERS AND YOUNG APPRENTICES CAN BE ATTRACTED TO
TRADE UNION LIBRARIES BY A GREAT VARIETY OF LIBRARY GAMES, QUIZES AND
COMPETITIONS. INFORMATION WORKERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN
THE COMECON INFORMATION SYSTEM A S WELL AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INTERNATIONAL
DINFORM.
RESOLUTION OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMISSION ON COORDINATION OF THE
ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES.

THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION ON THE CURRENT STATE AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF
TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS PASSED DURING A MEETING OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL

DESCRIBES EVENTS CULMINATING IN THE CREATION OF THE 1ST CANADIAN ON-LINE
COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING NETWORK IN 1975; SUMMARISES DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EARLY
1980S; AND TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT AND OF THE REALITY OF
COMPUTERISED LIBRARY NETWORKS IN CANADA DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS. UNDERLINES
PROBLEMS REMAINING TO BE SOLVED AND IDENTIFIES PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR THE DECADE
AHEAD, WITH A VIEW TO IMPLEMENTING A NATIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK
GEARED TO CANADA'S NEEDS.
LIBRARY NETWORKS, 1981-82.

DETAILED STUDY OF LIBRARY NETWORKING IN THE USA WITH SECTIONS INCLUDING' THE
SCOPE OF NETWORKING; THE COMPUTER UTILITIES; SUPPLIERS TO THE MARKET; NATIONAL

PROGRAMS.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. HIGHLIGHTS
THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF POPULAR CULTURE MATERIALS FOR THE AUDIENCE AND
POTENTIAL CLIENTELE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SUGGESTING SEVERAL AREAS OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARY SECTORS.
LIBRARY NETWORKS AND PLANNING. THIRD AND LAST PART.

THE CONCLUSION OF A STUDY PRESENTED IN 1980 AT THE FRENCH ECOLE NATIONALE
SUPERIEURE DE BIBLIOTHECAIRES, ANALYSING LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN THE
1960S AND 70S IMPLEMENTED IN PARIS AND MONTREAL. (FOR PARTS 1 AND 2 SEE
81/5362 AND 81/5363). ANALYSES THE RESULTS, DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ON THE BASIC
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PARIS AND MONTREAL SITUATIONS, THE SOLUTIONS PROPOSED,
AND THE REASONS FOR AND CONSEQUENCES OF CERTAIN DECISIONS. FROM THE METHODS
USED, ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP A THEORY OF PLANNING, DRAWING ON PRINCIPLES DERIVED
FOR PLANNING STRATEGY, MARKETING MANAGEMENT, AND STUDIES OF POLICY DECISION IN
RELATION TO CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR. FINALLY CONSIDERS BRIEFLY THE FUTURE COURSE OF
RATIONALISATION AND PLANNING OF LIBRARY NETWORKS.
YOU CAN DO IT' A PR SKILLS MANUAL FOR LIBRARIANS.

WORKBOOK DESIGNED TO HELP LIBRARIANS SHARPEN THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY ATTRACTIVE, FUNCTIONAL, AND COMPETITIVE IN TODAY'S HIGHLY
VISUAL SOCIETY. CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS' FINDING OUT ABOUT YOUR
LIBRARY; SIGNS IDENTIFYING THE LIBRARY BUILDING; SPACE; DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS;
BUILDING SKILLS FOR VISUAL PR ACTIVITIES; SIGNS; DISPLAYS, EXHIBITS AND
BULLETIN BOARDS; INK PRINT ADVERTISING; THE NEWS (MASS) MEDIA; AUDIO-VISUAL
PRESENTATION; MEETING THE PUBLIC ON THEIR OWN GROUNDS; PROGRAMMING; DEVELOPING
A BASE OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR ONGOING SUPPORT; THE LIBRARY BOARD AND PR;
AND PR ASPECTS OF STAFF MANAGEMENT.
PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK-TENDENCIES AND EXPECTATIONS.

THE STANDARD OF LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK IN WEST GERMANY IS OFTEN
CONSIDERED TO BE LOWER THAN THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. INCREASING FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SOON MAKE THE LIBRARIES' TASK OF KEEPING UP
WITH MEDIA INDUSTRY TRENDS MORE DIFFICULT. IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES STILL WISH TO
BE REGARDED AS THE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTEMPORARY WORK WITH
CULTURAL MEDIA, THEY MUST PROVIDE BETTER PUBLICITY. EACH LIBRARY HAS
INDIVIDUAL FEATURES WHICH CAN PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.
LIBRARIANS MUST ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS, WHO WILL THEN SUPPORT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE LIBRARY,
RESULTING IN LESS EXPENDITURE FOR THE LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
'CULTURAL AGENT PROVOCATEUR', ORGANISING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES NOT ONLY TO
INCREASE LOANS BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE LIBRARY SERVICE QUALITY.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIBRARY PLANNING AND ITS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION.

AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO LIBRARY LAWS GUARANTEEING FINANCIAL PROVISION, PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WILL BE COUNTED AMONG THE 'VOLUNTARY' RESPONSIBILITIES OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED IN TIMES OF RECESSION. LIBRARY
PLANNING IS DESCRIBED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION,
INCLUDING THE IMPORTANCE OF ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES AND OF LIBRARY COOPERATION
WITH OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CONCERNED WITH
ORGANISATION, PERSONNEL AND FINANCE. MANY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS MUST BE SOLVED
BEFORE NEW PROJECTS CAN BE CARRIED OUT AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES MUST BE
TESTED.
LOCAL AUTHORITY LIBRARY PLANNING CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE LEGALLY BOUND TO PROVIDE LIBRARY SERVICES. THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE AREA SHOULD BE COVERED BY A LIBRARY NETWORK, INVOLVING COOPERATION
NOT ONLY WITH OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT ALSO WITH OTHER LIBRARY
ADMINISTRATORS, E.G. THE CHURCHES AND INDUSTRY. LIBRARIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT
AS COMMUNITY MEETING-PLACES AND AS EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL CENTRES. IN MANY
AREAS MINIMUM STANDARDS OF LIBRARY PROVISION HAVE NOT YET BEEN ATTAINED. SOME
PEOPLE CALL FOR STATE LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THE LIBRARY SERVICE BUT THIS
WOULD CAUSE TOO MANY COMPLICATIONS. CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE
DISTINGUISHED BY ITS AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM FROM COMPULSION BY THE STATE.
INTERVIEW METHODOLOGY-COMPARISON OF THREE TYPES OF INTERVIEW' ONE TO ONE,
GROUP AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS.

PROJECT INISS WAS ESTABLISHED ON 1 JULY 78 WITH A GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY, AND THE WORK WAS COMPLETED IN OCT 80. THE AIM WAS
TO EVALUATE A NUMBER OF SMALL-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL INNOVATIONS FOR THE
IMPROVEMENT SERVICES IN SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS. 3 INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES
WERE USED' ONE TO ONE, GROUP AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS. DESCRIBES THESE METHODS
AND OFFERS GUIDELINES FOR THEIR SUITABILITY IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS.
A KEYNESIAN APPROACH TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO INDIA. ATTACKS THE BELIEF THAT THE LARGER
THE SIZE OF THE BOOK STOCK, THE GREATER THE DEMAND WILL BE. FAVOURS
REALLOCATION OF SOME OF THE BOOK RESOURCES TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SERVICES TO
EXPLOIT THE COLLECTIONS, BASING ARGUMENTS ON J.M. KEYNES.
REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FROM COMPUTER-BASED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS IN
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

REVIEWS THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FROM COMPUTER BASED
CIRCULATION SYSTEMS IN UNIVERSITY AND POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE UK. 3 BROAD
TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE DESCRIBED' STATISTICAL, OPERATIONAL AND ANALYTICAL
AND INSTANCES GIVEN OF THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS OF EACH TYPE. BRIEF
DESCRIPTIONS ARE GIVEN OF THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION BEING PRODUCED AND USED
IN SELECTED LIBRARIES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVING PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN FUND
ALLOCATION, LOAN REGULATION, BOOK BUYING AND STOCK MANAGEMENT. FACTORS
DETRACTING FROM THE VALUE OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FROM AUTOMATED-CIRCULATION
SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED AND AREAS WHERE FURTHER WORK MIGHT BE PROFITABLE ARE
INDICATED.
MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY.

CONVEYS TO LIBRARY MANAGERS ESSENTIAL FACTS ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND USES
OF TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS WHAT REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS MAY BE HELD AND
COST-EFFECTIVE DECISIONS MADE. TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE' COMPLEXITY OF
TECHNOLOGY; NETWORK PARTICIPATION; COSTS; DECLINE IN PRODUCTIVITY; CHANGED
ROLES OF STAFF; AND MAN VERSUS MACHINE.
REPORT TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FOR THE
PERIOD JANUARY 1978-FEBRUARY 1980.

THIS IS THE 4TH REPORT WHICH DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
RESEARCH UNIT, AND RECORDS THE UNIT'S CHANGE OF NAME TO THE CENTRE FOR LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN JUNE 79, FOLLOWING A REASSESSMENT OF THE AIMS
AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CENTRE.

CONSIDERS THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT BEAR UPON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT
OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. FACTORS INCLUDE; THE LIBRARY'S FUNCTION, THE
PURPOSE OF THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION (E.G. THE UNIVERSITY). FACTORS TENDING TO
INHIBIT OR INCREASE THE SIZE OF A COLLECTION ARE DETAILED.
MANAGEMENT CONCERNS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF TENNESSEE' A SURVEY OF
ADMINISTRATOR ATTITUDES.

(PHD DISSERTATION-GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS OF VANDERBILT
UNIVERSITY.) IDENTIFIES CURRENTLY PRACTISING ACADEMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS
IN TENNESSEE AND PRESENTS THEIR ATTITUDES AND OPINIONS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT AND ATTEMPTS' (1) TO DETERMINE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS OF
ACADEMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AS VIEWED BY PRACTISING ADMINISTRATORS; (2) TO
DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE STYLES AND TECHNIQUES USED; (3) TO DISCOVER WHAT
TRENDS, IF ANY, EXISTED; (4) TO PROVIDE LIBRARIANS WITH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
DATA ON WHICH TO BASE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS; AND (5) TO ESTABLISH A LINE OF
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ACADEMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS, PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS
AND LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATORS, AND TO STIMULATE FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.
MODERN MARKETING TECHNIQUES FOR THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES.

DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR MORE MODERN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE SITUATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES CAN BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE BY APPLYING THOSE MARKETING
TECHNIQUES WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY USER-ORIENTED. EXPLAINS THE CONCEPTS OF
MARKETING, MARKETING STRATEGY, AND MARKETING RESEARCH. SUGGESTS THAT THERE
SHOULD BE REGULAR FEEDBACK OF INFORMATION REGARDING USER PREFERENCES AND
BEHAVIOUR TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM ALLOCATION AND UTILISATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES.
CONCEPTUAL DIMENSIONS OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.

SUGGESTS A DESCRIPTIVE MODEL THAT WOULD INTERRELATE SOME FAMILIAR CONCEPTS OF
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT WITHIN A UNIFIED SYSTEM. THE APPROACH IS THEORETICAL,
CONCENTRATING ON A RELATIONAL NATURE OF CONCEPTUAL MANAGEMENT, DISTINGUISHING
IT FROM THE TRADITIONAL PRAGMATIC DEFINITION. THE MODEL ILLUSTRATES THE
3-DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION, ENCOMPASSING THE
PROCEDURAL-TECHNICAL, THE CONTEXTUAL-SERVICE ORIENTED, AND THE
CONCEPTUAL-THEORETICAL LEVELS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE.

CENTRALISATION IS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE IN RSFSR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATE OF
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC). IN 1980, 2,200 CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS, (CLS),
OPERATED IN RUSSIA, UNITING 50,000 LIBRARIES. BUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITIONS AND
STOCK-EXPLOITATION HAMPER CLS. MANY CENTRAL LIBRARIES COMPLAIN OF A
DETERIORATION OF ACQUISITIONS, ESPECIALLY OF FICTION AND CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE. BOOK-ORDERING DEPARTMENTS DO NOT FULFIL CLS ORDERS, BUT DUMP
UNWANTED BOOKS ON THEM. RELATIONS BETWEEN BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIES NEED
OVERHAULING. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR FULFILLING LIBRARIES' BOOK
ORDERS. INCREASED FINES MAY PREVENT LOSS OF BOOKS. CLS NEED BINDING EQUIPMENT
FOR BOOK REPAIRS AND SHOULD IMPROVE BOOK USE BY INTRA-SYSTEM BOOK-EXCHANGE,
THUS IMPROVING SERVICE TO RURAL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIANS NEED HIGHER SPECIALISED
EDUCATION TO EQUIP THEM FOR READING-GUIDANCE.
RESOURCES OF LIBRARY CENTRALISATION; AN EDITORIAL 'ROUND TABLE'. THE MAIN WORK
LIES AHEAD.

CENTRALISATION HAS FREED LIBRARIANS FROM MANY ROUTINE TASKS, MAKING THEIR WORK
MORE CREATIVE. LIBRARIES' TRANSFORMATION INTO SOCIAL AND LEISURE CENTRES HAS
COMPELLED LIBRARIANS TO EXTEND THE SUBJECT RANGE OF WORK WITH THE PUBLIC.
CENTRALISATION'S PROBLEMS INCLUDE' UNSATISFIED BOOK REQUESTS; UTILISATION OF
UNIFIED BOOKSTOCK; NEED FOR LIBRARY MECHANISATION AND FOR STAFF WITH
SPECIALISED LIBRARY EDUCATION; INTERLIBRARY LOANS. THE BOOKTRADE HAS SHIRKED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUILDING UP LIBRARY STOCKS; 85% OF LIBRARY FICTION AND 90%
OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE REQUIREMENTS REMAIN UNFULFILLED. THE 11TH 5-YEAR-PLAN
MUST INVOLVE' (1) INTENSIFYING LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASED
EFFECTIVENESS; (2) MAXIMUM SATISFACTION OF BOOK-REQUESTS; (3) ENHANCING
LIBRARIES' SOCIAL ROLE; (4) TRAINING LIBRARY STAFF FOR A CREATIVE
WORK-RELATIONSHIP; (5) LEARNED LIBRARIES' AND BOOKSELLERS' PARTICIPATION TO
IMPROVE CENTRALISATIO N.
A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS IN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES.

A GOAL OF LIBRARIES IS TO ASSURE THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES. MANY USE
STANDARDS AS A METHOD OF ASSURING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES, BUT STANDARDS HAVE
OFTEN FAILED THROUGH A LACK OF INDIVIDUAL COMMITMENT TO THOSE STANDARDS AND TO
THE METHODOLOGY USED IN ESTABLISHING THEM. MANY SEGMENTS OF THE HEALTH CARE
FIELD HAVE ADOPTED THE CONCEPT OF QUALITY ASSURANCE AND ARE APPLYING IT TO THE
SERVICE AND CARE THEY PROVIDE. THE PROCESS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE OR
ASSURE QUALITY OF SERVICE. IT INVOLVES' SELECTION OF A SUBJECT FOR REVIEW;
DEVELOPING MEASURABLE CRITERIA; RATIFYING THE CRITERIA; EVALUATING EXISTING
SERVICES USING THE CRITERIA; IDENTIFYING AND ANALYSING PROBLEMS; DEVELOPING
AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS; AND REEVALUATING SERVICES. 2 PILOT QUALITY
ASSURANCE STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE MIDWEST HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARY NETWORK IN
JUNE 78 ARE DESCRIBED. PLANS ARE UNDERWAY TO USE THIS PROCESS ON A REGIONAL
BASIS.
THE BANCO DEL LIBRO GIVES TECHNICAL ADVICE ON COLOMBIA'S MOBILE LIBRARY
SERVICE.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A UNESCO SPONSORED PROJECT UNDER THE
SUPERVISION OF A VENEZUELAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES EXPERT. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
PLANNING AND OPERATION OF THE SERVICE, AND STAFF TRAINING.
THE PRACTICE OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH IN LIBRARIES.

THE APPLICATION OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH METHODS TO LIBRARY-TYPE PROBLEMS HAS A
LONG HISTORY WHICH PREDATES THE FORMATION OF THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH SOCIETY.
ITS PRACTICE CONTINUES TODAY BUT MUCH OF ITS EMPHASIS HAS SHIFTED FROM CONCERN
WITH THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OF A LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY MANAGER TO THE MORE
GENERAL PROBLEMS OF DESIGNING LARGE INFORMATION NETWORKS AND SATISFYING THE
INFORMATION NEEDS OF LARGE CLASSES OF USERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SERVICES.
MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES.

OVERVIEW OF THE CONCEPT OF MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE
TO ITS APPLICATIONS TO THE LIBRARY PROFESSION.
ABOLITION OF CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES: YES OR NO?' THE OPINIONS OF LOCAL
COUNCILLORS.

TEXT OF A DISCUSSION WITH COUNCILLORS INVOLVED IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICES IN 3 LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE COUNCILLOR
FROM RIJSWIJK, WHERE CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP WERE ABOLISHED ON 1
JAN 74, POINTED OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED BORROWERS HAD RISEN FROM
12,907 IN 1973 TO 21,183 IN 1974. HOWEVER, THE GROWTH IN MEMBERSHIP FIGURES
HAD LED TO INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE EXISTING SERVICES WITH THE RESULT THAT IT
HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO REDUCE LIBRARY OPENING HOURS FROM 47 1/2 HOURS TO 29
1/2 HOURS PER WEEK. THE UITHOORN AND HEERHUGOWAARD COUNCILLORS DEFENDED THE
POLICY OF THEIR LOCAL COUNCILS IN MAINTAINING CHARGES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY
WERE NOT EXCESSIVE.
DIVERSIFYING FISCAL SUPPORT BY PRICING PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES' A POLICY
IMPACT ANALYSIS.

ADDRESSES THE POSSIBILITY OF DIVERSIFYING THE RESOURCE BASE OF US LOCAL PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEMS WHICH CURRENTLY ARE CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON PROPERTY TAXES FOR
THEIR FUNDING. OFFERS A CASE FOR PRICING LIBRARY SERVICES, AND AN EMPIRICAL
ANALYSIS OF SUCH A POLICY WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY
SYSTEM IS REPORTED. EMPLOYING A DELIBERATE SEQUENCE OF SIGNIFICANCE TESTS
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AN INTERRUPTED TIME-SERIES, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TO
STUDY THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAMME ON SERVICE DEMAND, THE RESULTS ARE EVALUATED
WITH RESPECT TO SEVERAL ECONOMIC AND EVALUATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERA. WHILE
SUCH A USER-CHARGE POLICY MAY NOT BE WHOLLY ADEQUATE OR EFFICIENT, IT IS
EFFECTIVE, PROMOTES EQUITY, AND IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO SUPPLEMENT CURRENT
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS.
WHAT DOES IT REALLY COST TO RUN YOUR LIBRARY?.

CURRENT FINANCIAL REPORTING PRACTICES FOR LIBRARY EXPENDITURES GENERALLY
EXCLUDE COSTS/SERVICES WHICH ARE 'CONTRIBUTED' TO THE LIBRARY FROM BEYOND ITS
BUDGET BY OTHER UNITS WITHIN THE LARGER PARENT INSTITUTION (WHETHER IT BE A
CITY, SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY). REPORTS A SPECIFIC COST CASE STUDY ANALYSIS OF A
PARTICULAR UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, DETAILING THE COSTS OF PROVIDING LIBRARY
SERVICES TO USERS.
GUIDE TO LIBRARY AUTOMATION.

DIRECTED TOWARD LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS WHO WISH TO PROCURE
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS OR SERVICES FOR THEIR LIBRARIES, THIS GUIDE OFFERS PRACTICAL
SUGGESTIONS, ADVICE, AND METHODS FOR DETERMINING REQUIREMENTS, ESTIMATING
COSTS AND BENEFITS, WRITING SPECIFICATIONS, PROCURING SYSTEMS, NEGOTIATING
CONTRACTS, AND INSTALLING SYSTEMS. THE ADVICE REFLECTS THE EXPERIENCES OF
LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES. SYSTEMS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
ACQUISITIONS, AUDIO-VISUAL CATALOGUING, CIRCULATION, REFERENCE, AND SERIALS
FUNCTIONS ARE DESCRIBED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN LIBRARIES.

THE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS RESPOND TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL DETERMINE, IN
PART, THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN THE CULTURE OF THE YEARS TO COME. A METHOD CALLED
TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT WILL AID LIBRARIANS IN THIS AREA. THE METHOD CONSISTS OF
7 STEPS' (1) DEFINE THE TASK OF THE ASSESSMENT; (2) DESCRIBE THE NEW HARDWARE
IN DEPTH; (3) DEVELOP THE STATE-OF-THE-LIBRARY ASSUMPTIONS; (4) IDENTIFY
IMPACT AREAS AND EFFECTS OF THE NEW DEVICE; (5) MAKE A PRELIMINARY IMPACT
ANALYSIS; (6) IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES; (7) COMPLETE THE IMPACT
ANALYSIS.
NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE LIBRARIES.

THE REALLY EFFECTIVE EQUIPMENT WITH LASER, HOLOGRAPHIC AND BUBBLE MEMORIES IS
NOT WITHIN THE REACH OF MOST LIBRARIES AND IS STILL IN PROTOTYPE USAGE ONLY.
NEW TECHNOLOGY IS MOST NEEDED BY STAFF IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PLANNING,
PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENTS. SCIENTIFIC BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN SLOVAKIA
USE MICROFILM AND MICROFICHE AS WELL AS REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. MATICA
SLOVENSKA (THE NATIONAL LIBRARY) COMPUTERISED NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND
BRATISLAVA CENTRAL ECONOMIC LIBRARY ISSUES EKO-INDEX-A LIST OF WORLD ECONOMICS
LITERATURE. FOREIGN PERIODICALS IS A COMPUTERISED PUBLICATION OF BRATISLAVA
UNIVERSITY AND THE CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION
(VTZ-UVTEI) IN PRAGUE. THE STATE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY AT KOSICE USES
MICROCOMPUTER OLIVETTI AUDITRONIC 770 WITH ASSOCIATED PERIPHERALS AND
CZECHOSLOVAK MADE TESLA RPP 16S WITH 128KB OF CPU MEMORY CAPACITY AND 8
EXTERNAL MEMORY UNITS, 7 VDU'S, 7 TERMINALS, 8 PRINTERS, 1 CARDREADER E TC.

DISCUSSES THE FACTORS LEADING TO THE ORIGIN OF THE STEREOTYPE LIBRARIAN (A
'FUSSY OLD WOMAN OF EITHER SEX, MYOPIC AND REPRESSED, BRANDISHING OR PERHAPS
COWERING BEHIND A DATE-STAMP AND SURROUNDED BY AN ARRAY OF NOTICES WHICH
FORBID VIRTUALLY EVERY HUMAN ACTIVITY'); ITS PERPETUATION IN THE MEDIA TODAY;
ATTEMPTS BY LIBRARIANS TO REDEEM THEIR IMAGE (MOST ATTEMPTS BACKFIRE,
ENHANCING THE IMAGE EVEN MORE); THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF WOMEN IN AND LOW STATUS
OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION, WHICH ARE BOUND UP WITH ITS IMAGE IN A WEB OF CAUSE
AND EFFECT; AND THE CONTRADICTION-LIBRARIANSHIP, THE BASTION OF THE MIDDLE
CLASSES, HAS WORKING CLASS ORIGINS.
THE STAFFING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR.

DISCUSSES THE AVAILABILITY AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY STAFF
IN 1914, THE LAST YEAR OF AN ERA OF RELATIVE STABILITY WHICH HAD EXISTED FOR

PAPER DELIVERED TO THE PROGRAMME MEETING OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
THE LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION'S MIDDLE MANAGEMENT
DISCUSSION GROUP, NEW YORK, 30 JUNE 80. WHILST LIBRARIANS ARE COMFORTABLE IN
THEIR TECHNICAL ROLES, THEY TEND NOT TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN SUPERVISORY
POSITIONS. DISCUSSES 4 AREAS OF MANAGEMENT' TIME MANAGEMENT AND DELEGATION,
INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, MOTIVATION AND GOAL-SETTING, WHICH SHOULD HELP
THE LIBRARIAN IN THE TRANSITION TO MANAGER.
A STUDY OF REPLACEMENT NEEDS AND NON-EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS AMONG THE
GOVERNMENT COLLEGE LIBRARIANS OF MADHYA PRADESH.

A STUDY INTO REPLACEMENT NEEDS DUE TO RETIREMENT IN GOVERNMENT-ADMINISTERED
COLLEGES IN MADHYA PRADESH, INDIA, INCLUDED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE NUMBER OF
STAFF ATTAINING QUALIFICATIONS AFTER JOINING THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND TIME
TAKEN; PERCENTAGE OF DIRECT ENTRANTS TO THE PROFESSION COMPARED WITH IN-SOURCE
SUPPLY; AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF ALL STAFF. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS AND
THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE'S LIBRARY TRAINING FACILITIES.
STAFFING LEVELS IN UNIVERSITY LAW LIBRARIES.

QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO 45 UNIVERSITIES IN THE UK AND EIRE IN 1980. THE
AIM WAS TO ASCERTAIN ACTUAL STAFFING LEVELS IN RELATION TO WORKLOAD AND
PROVIDE SOME EVIDENCE ON WHICH THE S.P.T.L. COULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
MINIMUM STAFFING.

STANDARDISED, STATEWIDE CERTIFICATION. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ERGONOMICS IN LIBRARIANSHIP.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE STUDY OF HUMAN BEINGS IN THEIR WORKING
ENVIRONMENT, IN PARTICULAR HEALTH, LEGAL RIGHTS, AND SOCIAL ETHICS. THE
RELEVANCE TO LIBRARIANSHIP IS DEMONSTRATED BY 3 PROBLEMS' CONTINUOUS ACTIVITY
IN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT; EXPOSURE TO THE GLARE OF THE SCREENS OF VISUAL DISPLAY
UNITS; AND WORKING IN CONDITIONS WHERE TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, VENTILATION, AND
DUST CONTROL ARE INADEQUATE.
ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS IN COLLEGES OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

ARGUES THAT, AS A GENERALISATION, LIBRARIANS WHO REGARD THEMSELVES AS ACTING
WITHIN AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT BEHAVE RATHER DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE WHO
STRESS THEIR LIBRARIANSHIP FUNCTIONS AND THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE RELATED TO
ACADEMIC STATUS. THE AWARD OF ACADEMIC STATUS ENCOURAGES THE FORMER BY
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING THOSE WILLING TO ADOPT AN EXTENDED EDUCATIONAL ROLE.
ACADEMIC RANK ALSO ELICITS THE INTERNALISATION, OR SELF-ASCRIPTION, BY THE
LIBRARIAN OF EDUCATIONAL ROLES.
REALISTIC (THAT IS, ACADEMIC) GRADINGS MEAN BETTER LIBRARIES.

ARGUES FOR ACADEMIC STATUS FOR COLLEGE LIBRARIANS THROUGH A DISCUSSION OF THE
INTRINSIC NATURE OF ACADEMIC WORK. EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE COLLEGE LIBRARIAN
IN DEPTH, COMPARING IT WITH DEFINITIONS OF ACADEMIC ACTIVITY, AND CONTENDS
THAT ACADEMIC GRADINGS MATERIALLY ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN COLLEGES TO DEVELOP
THEIR LIBRARIES, AND ARE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH CONTRACTUAL PATTERNS IN
OTHER SECTORS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ISSUES AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.

URGES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STAFF DEVELOPMENT
AND THE REQUIREMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
CONSIDERATIONS. THE LEGAL CLIMATE IS EXPLORED, ALONG WITH VARIOUS
ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS THAT IMPINGE ON THESE ISSUES. A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS
ARE MADE FOR ASSURING THAT STAFF DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MEET EQUAL EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITY AND OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OBJECTIVES. FINALLY,
SEVERAL UNRESOLVED ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED.
DESIGNING A TRAINING EVALUATION SYSTEM.

CALLS FOR IMPROVED EVALUATION OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES, AND
PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE AND USEFUL EVALUATION. ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO
WHAT TO EVALUATE, METHODS OF EVALUATION AND DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, AND
UTILISATION OF EVALUATION RESULTS. A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL IS GIVEN FOR
DESIGNING AN EVALUATION SYSTEM.
LIBRARIANS AND LABOR RELATIONS.

PRESENTS INFORMATION ON SPECIALISED LABOUR RELATIONS IN THE USA, EXPLAINS
ABOUT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, AND INDICATES HOW SUCH MATTERS BEAR ON US
LIBRARIES.
QUALIFIED STAFF-A BASIC FACTOR OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

VOLUNTEERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE CONSTANT INCREASING
DEMANDS FROM THE READERS. THUS THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES PROFESSIONALLY
STAFFED IS STEADILY RISING AND AT PRESENT IS 4 TIMES HIGHER COMPARED TO 1957
AND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS IS NEARLY 9 TIMES HIGHER. DURING THE
PAST 14 YEARS THE READERSHIP IN LIBRARIES RUN BY VOLUNTEERS INCREASED BY 7.5%
WHILE IN THOSE RUN BY QUALIFIED STAFF IT INCREASED BY 163%. THE NUMBER OF
LOANS IN LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PART-TIME WORKERS INCREASE TWICE WHILE IN
LIBRARIES WITH QUALIFIED STAFF IT INCREASED 4 TIMES. THESE ARE ONLY 2 EXAMPLES
OF HOW QUALIFIED STAFF CONTRIBUTED TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. HOWEVER, FOR THE TIME BEING, THE VOLUNTEERS WILL BE
MAINTAINED DUE TO THE PRESENT SITUATION.
SCIENTISTS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION WORK' II.

RESULTS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF THE 1974-78 MSC IN INFORMATION STUDIES
GRADUATES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE 1975
SHEFFIELD SURVEY AND OTHERS. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF
GRADUATES ENTERING INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, POLYTECHNICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE AND
A DECREASE IN THE PROPORTION ENTERING UNIVERSITIES OR RETURNING TO UK POSTS.
RESPONDENTS SHOWED A HIGH DEGREE OF MOBILITY BETWEEN SECTORS OF EMPLOYMENT.
HALF THE POSTS INVOLVED COMPUTER APPLICATIONS. THEIR PRESENT POST WAS
CONSIDERED SATISFACTORY BY 82% OF RESPONDENTS.
IN SERVICE TRAINING COURSES FOR VOLUNTARY WORKERS.

IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA FROM A TOTAL OF MORE THAN 1,100 PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ABOUT
950 ARE STAFFED BY PART-TIME LIBRARIANS. THEY WORK ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS MAINLY
IN THE VILLAGES. ON AVERAGE 50% ARE TEACHERS FROM LOCAL SCHOOLS. IN SPITE OF
THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK, THE VOLUNTEERS OFTEN LACKED THE NECESSARY
KNOWLEDGE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. FOR THAT REASON,
REGULATIONS, ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN 1976, IMPOSED THE
DUTY ON DISTRICT LIBRARIES TO MAKE PROVISIONS FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF THE
SAID LIBRARIANS, RANGING FROM 8 TO 24 HOURS PER YEAR. SO FAR, THE SYLLABUSES
OF SUCH SHORT COURSES AS WELL AS TEACHING METHODS HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY. IN
ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS AND ROLE PLAYING, FOR
INSTANCE, ARE TO BE USED MORE WIDELY. MORE PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH SLOVAK
AND FOREIGN LITERATURE (BELLES-LETTRES, FICTION) AND ALSO A GREATER INSIGHT
INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ADULTS WILL NO DOUBT,  EXERCISE FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE ON
THE LIBRARIAN'S PERFORMANCE, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL RESULT IN EXPANSION OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY AND ITS SERVICES.
MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.

EXPLORES CONCEPTS OF PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT AND RELATES THEM TO THE
MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS LIBRARIAN. IDENTIFIES 6 BASIC SKILLS
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO SUCH LIBRARIANS-BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENTS AND MICROFORMS, PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF MICROFORM EQUIPMENT,
ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY, HUMAN RELATION SKILLS, ABILITY TO ACTIVELY PROMOTE USE
OF MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BY MANIPULATING THE LOCAL POLITICAL
ENVIRONMENT, AND ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES.
CAN YOU AFFORD TO STAY HOME?.

PRESENTS 11 INTERVIEWS WITH MEDICAL LIBRARIANS WHO ATTENDED THE ANNUAL MEETING
OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C., 16-20 JUNE 80. THE
LIBRARIANS DISCUSS THEIR WORK AND THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT THE MLA MEETING.
PREVENTING PUBLIC SEX IN LIBRARY SETTINGS.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES ATTRACT SUBSCRIBERS WHO USE THE LIBRARY IN BOTH LEGITIMATE
AND ILLEGITIMATE WAYS. ONE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS USING THE LIBRARY FOR
UNCONVENTIONAL PURPOSES ARE PUBLIC EROTICISTS WHO USE THE TOILETS AND OTHER
ACCESSIBLE AREAS FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES. RATHER THAN CONSUMER SECURITY TIME IN
TRYING TO ENTRAP AND/OR ARREST THESE INDIVIDUALS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT
CHANGING SECURITY FUNCTIONING AND GOALS AND A FEW MINOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES
WILL DISCOURAGE MOST IF NOT ALL SUCH BEHAVIOUR.
WAGING THE WAR AGAINST CRIMES IN FLORIDA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

LIBRARY CRIMES HAVE GROWN AND MULTIPLIED IN NUMBER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY
ARE RATING HIGH ON THE LIST OF PRIORITIES OF MANY PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN FLORIDA.
THE NEED TO USE AS MANY KINDS OF EFFECTIVE, TACTICAL, AND INEXPENSIVE
TECHNIQUES AS POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE OR LESSEN THE SEVERITY AND EXCESSIVENESS OF
LIBRARY CRIMES IS APPARENT.

PROBLEMS OF LIBRARY LIGHTING.

INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO CERTAIN FORMULA FOR THE OPTIMISATION OF LIBRARY
LIGHTING, AND EXPERTS DIFFER IN THEIR OPINIONS ON THE BEST LIGHTING. FOR MANY
YEARS 'THE MORE, THE BETTER' WAS THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIGHTING DESIGN, BUT THE
EFFECT CAN BE UNIFORM, MONOTONOUS, COLD AND RATHER SOULLESS. DISCUSSES THE
PROS AND CONS OF USING DAYLIGHT AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING, AS WELL AS THE
BIOLOGICAL NEEDS FOR DAYLIGHT. PROPOSES A NEW CONCEPT OF LIGHTING DESIGN,
BASED ON VISUAL TASKS AND BIOLOGICAL NEEDS, WHICH SHOULD BE ENTERED IN THE
BUILDING PROGRAMME, TO ENABLE THE ARCHITECT TO EMPLOY THE BEST LIGHTING FOR
VISUAL TASKS, THE INTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THE LIBRARY AND THE WELL-BEING OF ITS
READERS.

CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS OVERCOMING MANY OF THE BARRIERS AROUND THE HANDICAPPED.
THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND REFERRAL ACTIVITY FOR THE HANDICAPPED
IN THE USA, BUT IT IS UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND THE HANDICAPPED ARE NOT ALWAYS
AWARE OF IT. LIBRARIES CAN BE A GREAT SOURCE OF BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT
HANDICAPPING CONDITIONS, COPING TECHNIQUES, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SOURCES,
AND RELEVANT LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORGANISATIONS. INCLUDES A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF US
PUBLICATIONS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICES FOR
THE HANDICAPPED.

STUDIES PROGRAMMES AND THE COLLECTIONS WHICH SUPPORT THEM. BASED ON AN
ASSESSMENT OF THE PAST GROWTH AND CURRENT PROGRAMMES, SOME PROJECTIONS ON THE
FUTURE DIRECTIONS ARE MADE. THE INCREASING APPLICATION OF COMMUNICATION
SATELLITES HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE.
INFORMATION SERVICES, POPULAR CULTURE, AND THE LIBRARIAN' PROMOTING A
CONTEMPORARY LEARNING PERSPECTIVE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. EXAMINES
THE ROLE OF BOTH THE PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN AS SOURCES OF COMPREHENSIVE
INFORMATION SERVICE TO ALL PATRONS, CONTENDING THAT EFFECTIVE SERVICE MUST BE
GUIDED BY 2 KEY PRINCIPLES' (1) THE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PURSUITS OF
CONTEMPORARY PEOPLE ARE INNER-DIRECTED AND DESERVE ACCESS TO AN UNRESTRICTED
STORE OF INFORMATION; AND (2) LIBRARIES MUST PROVIDE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE
SPECTRUM OF MATERIALS SO THAT THE PUBLIC WILL PERCEIVE THE LIBRARY AS A
REASONABLE, RELIABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE FOR ALL TYPES OF
INFORMATION NEEDS.
THE CONTRIBUTION OF SYSTEM MISON TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF INFORMATION SERVICES IN
THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.

MISON IS THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES FORMED BY 8
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES (INCLUDING VIETNAM SOCIALIST REPUBLIC) SOME 3 1/2 YEARS
AGO AND IT REPRESENTS ONE ASPECT OF THE COOPERATION IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. A
BRIEF REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM IS GIVEN AND IT IS EMPHASISED THAT SOCIAL
SCIENTISTS IN THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES MUST FIGHT VIGOROUSLY ALL THE ATTACKS
IMPERIALIST AND BOURGEOIS THEORETICIANS MOUNT AGAINST THE SCIENTIFIC
STRONGHOLDS OF COMMUNISM. MISON OUTPUT SYSTEM INION ISSUES THEMATIC HANDBOOKS,
MAGAZINES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PUBLICATIONS, WHICH DEAL WITH SPECIALISED TOPICS
E.G. THE FORMATION OF SOCIAL UNITY IN A DEVELOPED SOCIALIST STATE, THE
PROGRESS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST INTEGRATION, THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIALIST
CULTURE ON THE FORMATION OF NEW SOCIALIST CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE CITIZENS, THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF INVESTMENT IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IN THE SOCIALIST COUNT
RIES, NON-CAPITALIST WAYS OF PROGRESS IN THE LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND MANY
OTHERS. INFORMATION ON MAGNETIC TAPES IS PROCESSED BY AIS MISON.
POPULATION INFORMATION ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES IN ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION.

POPULATION SIZE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT. POPULATION INFORMATION IS AN INTER-DISCIPLINARY SUBJECT UTILISED
BY A VARIETY OF USERS, INCLUDING POLICY MAKERS, THOSE IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMMES
OF POPULATION CONTROL, RESEARCHERS, ACADEMICIANS, AND EDUCATION AUTHORITIES
AND OFFICIALS. POPULATION INFORMATION ACTIVITIES ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN AT THE
NATIONAL LEVEL AND BY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES IN SEVERAL ASIA AND PACIFIC
REGION COUNTRIES. DISCUSSES THE STATES OF DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH ACTIVITIES,
HIGHLIGHTING THE WELL-DEVELOPED SITUATIONS IN INDIA, INDONESIA, THE
PHILIPPINES, AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS FACING MOST
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION-MANPOWER, EQUIPMENT, LANGUAGES, AND TECHNICAL TOOLS
FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION.

INFORMATION SCIENCE PROFESSION.
THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF R & D.

NOTE. AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THIS ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, (1) 1980, 63-65. SUGGESTS THAT INFORMATION
CENTRES ARE IN THE POSITION TO EVALUATE THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL POTENTIAL
OF R & D GROUPS AND TO FORECAST LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE CONNECTED
WITH NEW PROJECTS. SUCH EVALUATIONS MUST BE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE
DATA, INVENTIONS AND TECHNICAL REPORTS; THE RANGE OF THE DOCUMENTATION COVERED
BY THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE.
FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SERVICE PROVIDED BY A LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE METHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES USED BY THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF LITHUANIAN SSR FOR PROVISION OF FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SERVICES. THE SOURCES OF FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION INCLUDE MAINLY TRADE
LITERATURE, STANDARDS AND PATENT DOCUMENTATION. BECAUSE NOT ALL FACTOGRAPHIC
ENQUIRIES CAN BE ANSWERED FROM SOURCES HELD BY THE LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY
COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR PATENT
INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICAL RESEARCH, WITH THE ALL-UNION
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION, CLASSIFICATION AND
COORDINATION AND WITH A NUMBER OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES
IN THE USSR AND IN OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.
BETWEEN GIN AND TWIN' MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE THIRD WORLD.

AGREEMENT WAS REACHED AT THE UN CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR
DEVELOPMENT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GLOBAL INFORMATION NETWORK (GIN).
HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE INDUSTRIALISED
COUNTRIES AND ABSENCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, GIN IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A PAPER
AGREEMENT. EVEN IF IT WERE ESTABLISHED, IT WOULD DO LITTLE TO FULFIL THE REAL
SCIENCE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE THIRD WORLD. A BETTER ALTERNATIVE FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WOULD BE TO SHARE LOCALLY PRODUCED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
INFORMATION AMONGST THEMSELVES AND DEVELOP TWIN (A THIRD WORLD INFORMATION
NETWORK) TO MEET THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE INDICATIONS
THAT SUCH A SYSTEM IS RANDOMLY EVOLVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

THE ROLE PLAYED BY INSTITUTES FOR FURTHER EDUCATION IN THE ECONOMIC STRATEGY
OF THE USSR IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME OF THE
INSTITUTE FOR FURTHER EDUCATION OF INFORMATION SCIENTISTS. THE MAIN GOAL OF
THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME OF THIS INSTITUTE IS TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE EDUCATIONAL
PROGRAMME IS DISCUSSED WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ADVANCED
WORKING METHODS AND ON THE COOPERATION OF LECTURERS WITH EXPERTS IN VARIOUS
FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.

CONSIDERS ISSUES RELATING TO INFORMATION TRANSFER AND INFRASTRUCTURE
DEVELOPMENT FROM A THIRD WORLD VIEWPOINT, AND THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF RURAL
DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. LISTS PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING SYSTEMS FACILITATING
AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION SOURCES. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS
SHOULD INCORPORATE AN INFORMATION SECTOR, JUST AS, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS AN
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. DISCUSSES INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFER COSTS.
OFFERS SUGGESTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL BODIES, WHICH CAN CONSIDER MEANS AND
METHODS OF IMPROVING PUBLICATION CAPABILITIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND NOT
MERELY THEIR ACCESS TO EXTERNAL INFORMATION SOURCES.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY' PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD JERUSALEM CONFERENCE ON
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (JCIT3) JERUSALEM, AUGUST 6-9, 1978.

PAPERS FROM THE CONFERENCE, IN 35 SESSIONS, FOCUSING ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER,
AND ALSO DISCUSSING SOFTWARE AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, COMMUNICATION AND
NETWORKS, DATA BASES, COMPUTER DESCRIPTIONS AND THEIR USES, ADVANCED COMPUTER
APPLICATIONS IN GEOGRAPHIC MAP PROCESSING AND OTHER FIELDS, AND HISTORIES OF
COMPUTERS IN THE USA, ENGLAND AND ISRAEL.
TERMINOLOGY DOCUMENTATION IN GERMAN STANDARDS THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
TERMINOLOGY DATABANK.

THE GERMAN STANDARDS INSTITUTE HAS COLLECTED 30,000 STANDARD TERMINOLOGICAL
DEFINITIONS AND A FURTHER 30,000 SUBJECT TERMS NOT YET STANDARDISED, THROUGH
THE WORK OF OVER 100 COMMITTEES. THE ONLY WAY TO PRODUCE A CLEAR,
COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THEIR WORK WOULD BE BY CONSTRUCTING A TERMINOLOGY DATA
BANK WHICH MUST PROVIDE ACCESS POSSIBILITIES FOR TERMS AND SOURCES, REFERENCES
TO SYNONYMS, DISCARDED TERMS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE EQUIVALENTS, LINKS WITH THE
DINST ALTERATION SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IN THE COMPILATION OF SUBJECT
DICTIONARIES AND A THESAURUS ON STANDARD DOCUMENTATION. A PILOT PROJECT ON
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION TERMINOLOGY HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL; A DATA BANK
COVERING ALL STANDARD TERMINOLOGY COULD BE PRODUCED IN 2-3 YEARS.
HEALTH EFFECTS EVALUATION DATA FILE.

THE DESIGN OF THE HEALTH EFFECTS EVALUATION DATA (HEED) FILE AND THE METHODS
USED TO ABSTRACT, CODE, AND COMPUTERISE HEALTH HAZARD EVALUATION (HHE) AND
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TA) DATA ARE DESCRIBED.
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY: SUBSTITUTE OR SUPPORT FOR THE HUMAN
COMPONENTS?.

DISCUSSION ABOUT OR APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HINDERED BY PEOPLE'S
ATTITUDES TO IT, RANGING FROM THE OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC TO THE PROFOUNDLY
SUSPICIOUS. MEN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COMPUTERS, SO THE HUMAN FACTOR
IN TECHNOLOGY IS NEGLECTED. DATA BASES MUST, HOWEVER, BE ORIENTED TOWARDS
MAN'S NEEDS, AND DIALOGUE SYSTEMS ARE MEANT FOR MACHINES AND MEN; HUMAN
INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN MACHINES AND USERS WILL BE NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME. ALL
SCIENTISTS SEARCH THEIR OWN STOCK OF INFORMATION BEFORE USING OTHER SOURCES;
AT PRESENT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN OR ANALYSIS OF THESE SMALL, INFORMAL
STOCKS. CONNECTION OF LARGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS WOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN COMPONENTS. THE INFORMAL HUMAN
EXCHANGE OF OPINION AND THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ABILITY TO CREATE CROSS-CONNECTIONS
IN INFORMATION ARE STILL ESSENTIAL.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION HANDBOOK.

BASED ON THE ACRL GUIDELINES FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, THIS HANDBOOK IS
INTENDED NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTRUCTION
PROGRAMMES, BUT ALSO TO STIMULATE DISCUSSION WITHIN THE PROFESSION. IT
CONSISTS OF THE GUIDELINES, 5 MODEL STATEMENTS AND CHECKLISTS, A GLOSSARY, AND
A PATHFINDER. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

TEXAS COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE LIBRARY EXTENSION PROGRAM.

THE TEXAS COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE (TCOM) IN FORT WORTH STARTED A
LIBRARY EXTENSION PROGRAMME IN JAN 80, AIMED AT 3RD AND 4TH-YEAR OSTEOPATHIC
STUDENTS IN NORTH TEXAS. THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS WHO CAN
QUICKLY MOBILISE PATIENT CARE INFORMATION. HOSPITALS ARE VISITED REGULARLY IN
ROTATION AND FREE LIBRARY SERVICES ARE OFFERED. FREE LIBRARY REFERENCE
SERVICES FOR ALL OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS IN TEXAS THROUGH THE TCOM LIBRARY ARE
TO BE PROVIDED.
BIBLIOGRAPHY-THAT IS VERY INTERESTING! BUT WHY HAS IT NO PLACE IN THE SCHOOL
CURRICULUM?.

THE YAROSLAVL REGIONAL CHILDREN'S LIBRARY IS SUCCESSFULLY ORGANISING
LIBRARY/BIBLIOGRAPHY CLASSES FOR 1ST TO 8TH FORMERS, INCLUDING A QUARTERLY
BIBLIOGRAPHY DAY, AIMING TO INTEREST SCHOOL CHILDREN IN BOOKS. BIBLIOGRAPHY
DAY INCLUDES SONGS ABOUT FAMOUS LITERARY HEROES, QUESTIONS TO ANSWER FROM
ENCYCLOPAEDIAS, ETC. PLAYING WHILE LEARNING PROVED POSSIBLE, EVEN NECESSARY.
BUT THE REGION HAS ONLY PARTIALLY ADOPTED THE SYLLABUS' 'FOUNDATIONS OF
LIBRARY/BIBLIOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE'. IN 1979 THE GOVERNMENT PAPER ON IMPROVING
THE RSFR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERAL REPUBLIC) CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE STRESSED
THE NEED FOR STUDIES ACCORDING TO A GIVEN SYLLABUS. BUT 275 OUT OF 365 SCHOOLS
IN CHUVASHIYA AND 90% OF MOSCOW SCHOOLS AVOID THIS WORK. BIBLIOGRAPHIC
LITERACY IS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH LIBRARIES AND
EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS.
USER EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMMES' AN OVERVIEW.

OUTLINES THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY, CHARACTER, PLANNING, ORGANISATION, AND
EVALUATION OF UNESCO'S SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION USERS TRAINING
PROGRAMMES AND CALLS FOR THE APPROPRIATE INDIAN NATIONAL BODIES TO FORMULATE
AN INTEGRATED PLAN FOR USER EDUCATION.
UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS AS SEEKERS OF INFORMATION' SOURCES OF REFERENCES TO
BOOKS AND THEIR FIRST USE VERSUS DATE OF PUBLICATION.

QUESTIONING OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND PURE SCIENTISTS/TECHNOLOGISTS REVEALED
THAT THE PRINCIPAL ALERTING AGENT FOR THE FORMER IS THE LIBRARY, AND FOR THE
LATTER, THE SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND BOOKS BY
PUBLISHERS AND BOOKSELLERS. ANALYSIS OF 1ST USE VERSUS AGE REVEALED THAT A
BOOK'S INTEREST POTENTIAL DEPENDS UPON SEVERAL PARAMETERS' (1) USER COMMUNITY
(SCIENTIFIC FIELD); (2) ACTUALITY; AND (3) OBSOLESCENCE' THE RATE OF DECAY IS
DEPENDENT ON SOURCE AGE.
THE FINNISH PERIODICALS INDEX IS UNDERGOING CHANGES.

THE PRINTED VERSION OF THE FINNISH PERIODICALS INDEX COVERS 1957-77. IN
ADDITION THERE IS A RETROSPECTIVE INDEX FOR 1803-63. THE CURRENT INDEX IS NOW
PROCESSED BY A COMPUTER. THE INDEX IS SELECTIVE BOTH IN ITS COVERAGE OF
PERIODICALS AND PERIODICAL ARTICLES. UDC HAS BEEN USED SINCE COMPUTERISATION.
BECAUSE OF COMPUTERISATION THE PRESENTATION HAS SUFFERED. THERE ARE PLANS TO
DECENTRALISE THE INDEXING, WHICH UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE LIBRARY
OF TURKU UNIVERSITY, AND TO EXPAND THE COVERAGE.
MEETING AND CONFERENCE LITERATURE: NEW BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AIDS PUBLISHED IN 1979
AND 1980.

LISTS AND DESCRIBES SOME NEW BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AIDS TO THE CONFERENCE LITERATURE
OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ALL OF WHICH ARE TAKEN FROM THE HOLDINGS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF HANOVER LIBRARY AND TECHNISCHE INFORMATIONSBIBLIOTHEK.
INFORMATION GUIDES. A SURVEY OF SUBJECT GUIDES TO SOURCES OF INFORMATION
PRODUCED BY LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

REPORTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF 1600 LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN
THE UK WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN BY ASLIB IN 1977 AND WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE
THE PRODUCTION AND FORM OF BRIEF SUBJECT GUIDES TO SOURCES OF INFORMATION.
FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DECISION TO PRODUCE OR NOT TO PRODUCE SUCH MATERIALS
WERE ALSO STUDIED. THE 530 GUIDES FOUND WERE ANALYSED IN TERMS OF SUBJECT
COVERAGE, DUPLICATION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT SPECIFICITY, CONTENT, FORM OF ENTRY
AND LAYOUT, PHYSICAL FORMAT, DESIGN FEATURES, STYLE OF PRESENTATION AND
WRITTEN EXPRESSION, PAGE LAYOUT, USE OF ANNOTATIONS, AND ARRANGEMENT OF
CONTENTS.
GUIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND EVALUATION OF SERVICES FOR SELECTIVE
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.

REVISED VERSION OF UNESCO PUBLICATION PGI-78/WS/22. COMPILED BY J. PONCELET,
THIS GUIDE DESCRIBES THE COMPONENTS OF A SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF
INFORMATION (SDI) SERVICE AND EXPLAINS HOW TO ESTABLISH AND EVALUATE SUCH A
SERVICE. DEFINES THE MAIN FEATURES OF A COMPUTERISED DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM;
DESCRIBES THE CDS/ISIS (COMPUTERISED DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM/INTEGRATED SET OF
INFORMATION SYSTEMS) AND CAN/SDI (DEVELOPED BY THE CANADIAN INSTITUTE FOR
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION) SOFTWARE PACKAGES WHICH UNESCO MAKES
AVAILABLE TO ITS MEMBER STATES; AND EXPLAINS THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE
ESTABLISHMENT AND EVALUATION OF SDI SERVICES. CHARTS THE PLACE OF SDI SERVICES
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION INFRASTRUCTURES, MAINLY WITH THE
VIEW TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO WORLD SOURCES OF
INFORMATION. RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION OF 2 SDI SERVICES DEVELOPED WITH
UNESCO'S ASSISTANCE AND THE QUESTIONNAIRES USED ARE PRESENTED.
MANUAL SDI IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES THE NEED FOR SDI (SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION) SERVICES;
OUTLINES THE MAIN PROCEDURES IN SDI; AND DISCUSSES THE NON-AUTOMATED OPERATION
OF SDI SERVICES IN A SPECIAL LIBRARY.
COWOCOR' THE +C+OMPUTER +W+ORD +CODING AND +RESEARCH DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM OF
THE HOECHST COMPANY.

COWOCOR HAS BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE 1968 TO RATIONALISE DOCUMENTATION OF CHEMICAL
LITERATURE AND IMPROVE ITS TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTENT. INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION ARE CARRIED OUT IN 1 PROCESS BY MEANS OF MODERN TEXT PROCESSING
MACHINERY. THE PROCESS IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL; ABSTRACTS ARE RECORDED ON
MAGNETIC TAPES, WHOSE TEXTS ARE USED AS PRINTER'S COPY FOR A FORTNIGHTLY
ABSTRACTING JOURNAL. 150,000 ABSTRACTS ARE STORED AT PRESENT. THE TAPES ARE
THE BASIS OF INPUT, CODING AND RETRIEVAL. THE COWOCOR THESAURUS CONTAINS
75,000 TERMS INCLUDING SYNONYMS. THE CLASSIFICATION IS BASICALLY
MONOHIERARCHIC WITH ADDITIONAL POLYDIMENSIONS; THE TREATMENT OF SYNONYMS,
COMPOSITE TERMS AND HOMOGRAPHS IS DISCUSSED.
TESTING AND REVISION OF GUIDELINES FOR WRITING ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS IN THE
BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES.

GUIDELINES RESULTING FROM A PREVIOUS BRITISH LIBRARY PROJECT WERE TESTED IN
PRACTICE WITH THE COOPERATION OF 12 JOURNAL EDITORS IN THE BIOLOGICAL FIELD.
DURING THE TRIAL EDITORS ASKED AUTHORS TO USE THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES WHEN
AMENDING ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS RETURNED FOR REVISION. LENGTH, QUALITY
(PARTICULARLY INFORMATION CONTENT) AND STYLE WERE COMPARED IN 89 ORIGINAL AND
REVISED ABSTRACTS. THE REVISED ABSTRACTS SHOWED THAT THE GUIDELINES WERE OF
VALUE IN HELPING AUTHORS TO REVISE ABSTRACTS.
COVERAGE OF VETERINARY MATERIAL IN THE INDIAN SCIENCE ABSTRACTS.

DURING 1965-AUG 79, INDIAN SCIENCE ABSTRACTS COVERED 91 ARTICLES ON VETERINARY
SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY BY INDIAN AUTHORS; IT SHOULD HAVE COVERED AT
LEAST 269. COMPARES THIS COVERAGE WITH THAT OF INDEX VETERINARIUS (216
ARTICLES) AND COMPARES THE RANKING OF INDIAN VETERINARY SCIENCE PERIODICALS IN
THE 2 PUBLICATIONS.
JAPANESE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE AND ITS REFLECTION IN THE
PUBLICATIONS OF THE ALL-UNION INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION.

PRESENTS RESULTS OF AN ANALYSIS OF JAPANESE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
LITERATURE. POINTS OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF JAPANESE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
PUBLICATIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER WORLD WAR II. THE LARGEST
PROPORTION OF JAPANESE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS IS REPRESENTED BY
LITERATURE ON APPLIED SCIENCES (42.8%), FOLLOWED BY AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE
(22.7%), MEDICAL LITERATURE (19.4%) AND BY LITERATURE ON NATURAL SCIENCES. 21%
OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE PUBLISHED IS REPRESENTED BY MONTHLY PERIODICALS.
THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY. 21.2%
OF JAPANESE JOURNALS ARE CURRENTLY PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH COMPARED WITH 16.6% IN
1917. DISCUSSES THE COVERAGE OF JAPANESE JOURNALS IN THE ABSTRACT JOURNALS
PUBLISHED BY THE ALL-UNION INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
CPI SURVEYS-A SERVICE TO SUBSCRIBERS.

THE CANADIAN PERIODICAL INDEX (CPI) BEGAN AS AN INDEXING SERVICE AT THE
WINDSOR PUBLIC LIBRARY WHERE, FROM 1924-32 MIMEOGRAPHED PERIODICAL INDEXES
WERE PRODUCED. TODAY IT IS ORGANISED BY THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
WHICH ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT IN 1946. EVERY 3 YEARS CLA ESTABLISHES NEW
RATES BY MEANS OF A SUBSCRIPTION RATE SURVEY. A QUESTIONNAIRE IS SENT TO ALL
SUBSCRIBERS, LISTING PERIODICALS COVERED BY CPI, AND ASKING SUBSCRIBERS TO
LIST WHICH OF THESE ARE INCLUDED IN THE INSTITUTION'S HOLDINGS. COST-PER-ENTRY
IS THEN ESTABLISHED, AND TOTAL ENTRIES FOR A YEAR IN CPI ARE CALCULATED.
TAKING COSTS OF SALARIES, AUTOMATION, PUBLISHING AND RENT, CPI'S BUDGET IS
ESTABLISHED. DISCUSSES THE SURVEY IN DETAIL AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WHICH
ARISE FROM IT.
DEMAND-ADJUSTED SHELF AVAILABILITY PARAMETERS.

A MEASURE OF LIBRARY PERFORMANCE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE PATRON CAN FIND
THE MATERIAL SOUGHT. THIS PARAMETER, DOCUMENT AVAILABILITY, IS BEST MEASURED
BY SAMPLING THE EXPRESSED DEMAND. SAMPLING THE SHELF-LIST IS FAR LESS
INTRUSIVE, BUT FAILS TO PROVIDE DATA ON COLLECTION ADEQUACY, USER CATALOGUE
AND SHELF SKILLS, AND FACTORS INHIBITING AVAILABILITY (SUCH AS CIRCULATION).
DESCRIBES A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR ADJUSTING SHELF-LIST DATA TO REFLECT
EXPRESSED DEMAND RESULTS AND PRESENTS A WORKED EXAMPLE, EXPLAINING THE STEPS
INVOLVED.
INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL DOCUMENT PROVISION.

THE SEMINAR WAS ORGANISED BY THE IFLA OFFICE FOR INTERNATIONAL LENDING AND THE
BRITISH COUNCIL, AND WAS HELD AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION, 22-24
SEPT 80. THE AIM WAS TO DISCUSS DOCUMENT PROVISION AS PART OF THE GENERAL
THEME OF UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP). RECOMMENDATIONS,
PROCEEDINGS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS ARE SUMMARISED.
THE LAW FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS ONE MORE ON THE ROAD FOR
LEGISLATING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.

THE NEW LAW CAME INTO EFFECT AT THE BEGINNING OF 1981. A LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS
TO SET UP A COMMITTEE FOR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. OUT OF 84 TOWNS ONLY 9 HAD SUCH
A COMMITTEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. ALL OTHER TYPES OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES, 150 OF THEM, DID NOT HAVE ONE. THE DUTIES OF THE COMMITTEES ARE
THE OVERSIGHT AND INSTIGATION OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, COOPERATION BETWEEN
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES PUBLICITY, PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION, AND
BUDGET. FROM 1982 STATE GRANTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STAFF AND ORGANISATION
COSTS. THE NEW LAW SHOULD EASE THE WORK OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS WHO UNTIL
NOW HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGANISATION OF MANY OF THE LOCAL CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES.
MUSIC IN THE LIBRARY.

EVERYONE WHO WISHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN MUSICAL RECORDINGS OF INTEREST TO
THEM AND RELATED REFERENCE MATERIAL. BUT SOME READERS NEED QUALIFIED
SPECIALIST HELP. MOST PEOPLE VISIT THE MUSIC LIBRARY HOPING TO FIND SOME SORT
OF CLUB. LIBRARIANS MUST ESTIMATE WHICH RESOURCES WOULD ACHIEVE THE MUSIC
LIBRARY'S AIMS. A LARGE RECORD LIBRARY AND GOOD TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT ARE
ESSENTIAL. SERIES OF SLIDES ACCOMPANYING THE MUSIC CREATE A BETTER ARTISTIC
AND HISTORIC ATMOSPHERE. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD OBSERVE ALL NEW EVENTS IN THE
MUSICAL WORLD, MAINTAINING CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIS AUDIENCE'S INTERESTS AND
DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP ACTIVITIES TO MAKE THE MUSIC SECTION A CENTRE
OF ATTRACTION.
ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL LIBRARY' A CANADIAN HANDBOOK.

A REFERENCE BOOK ON TECHNICAL SERVICES FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS COVERING
ACQUISITION, CATALOGUING AIDS AND SERVICES, MAIN ENTRY HEADINGS, SUBJECT
HEADINGS, CLASSIFICATION, CARDS, BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILES, PROCESSING, SHELVING,
CIRCULATION, UPKEEP, AND FRENCH USAGE.
THE COMPATIBILITY OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY' DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE AN
INTEGRATED SYSTEM, OR MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO TIE YOUR CURRENT
SYSTEMS TOGETHER. COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS CAN TREAT LIBRARY DATA AS AN
ORGANISATIONAL RESOURCE, REDUCE DATA DUPLICATION, IMPROVE MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION, REDUCE THE OVERHEAD REQUIRED FOR SEPARATE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS, AND
MAKE CONVERSION TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY MORE FEASIBLE. PLANNING FOR COMPUTER
SYSTEMS COMPATIBILITY MUST BE COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE
LIBRARY, WHO CAN REFEREE DEPARTMENTAL CONFLICTS.
CHOOSING AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEM' A PLANNING GUIDE.

PRESENTS A METHODOLOGY, PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM AND SMALL LIBRARIES, OUTLINING
THE CONSIDERATION, SELECTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM. THE
METHOD MAY BE USED IN EVALUATING A VARIETY OF AUTOMATED SYSTEM OPTIONS,
INCLUDING TURNKEY SYSTEMS, USE OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITY, SOFTWARE TRANSFER,
DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM IN-HOUSE, AND OBTAINING SERVICES FROM THE COMMERCIAL
SECTOR.
THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES
PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, CONSIDERING HOW LIBRARIANS SHOULD APPROACH THE
INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE NECESSITY OF PLANNING IS ILLUSTRATED BY
EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS CANADIAN UNIVERSITY PROJECTS, AND THE SOPHISTICATED
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES OF TODAY COMPARED WITH THE EARLY EXPERIMENTAL PHASE IN
THE 1960S. PLANNING INVOLVES CONSIDERATION OF COSTS, BENEFITS AND OPERATIONAL
SATISFACTION IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASE, WHILE IMPLEMENTATION CHIEFLY INVOLVES
MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RELATIONS, AND THE ADOPTION OF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO
CHANGE WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERING CURRENT
PRACTICES. LIBRARIANS ATTITUDES TO AUTOMATION VARY, BUT THE ESSENTIAL GOAL IS
IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING TECHNIQUES, NOT INNOVATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE, WITH THE
EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, EFFICIENT SERVICE PROVISION, AND HARMONIOUS
USER RELATIONS.
AUTOMATED MATCHING AND AMALGAMATION OF MARC RECORDS IN THE DOBIS DATABASE.

THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT VERSION OF DOBIS (DORTMUNDER ON-LINE
BIBLIOTHEKSSYSTEM) IS AN ON-LINE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH A DATA BASE
THAT CAN BE MODIFIED EITHER THROUGH ON-LINE CATALOGUING OR THROUGH THE
OFF-LINE LOADING OF MARC RECORDS. OUTLINES THE TECHNIQUES USED AT THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY OF CANADA FOR OFF-LINE LOADING. NOTES THE CRITERIA USED TO IDENTIFY
DUPLICATE RECORDS AND DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF DECIDING WHETHER TO REPLACE A
RECORD COMPLETELY OR TO AMALGAMATE RECORDS. OUTLINES THE AMALGAMATION PROCESS
AND EXPLAINS THE SYSTEM FEATURES WHICH ALLOW THE ON-LINE CATALOGUER TO PROTECT
DATA ELEMENTS FROM OFF-LINE MODIFICATION.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES AND IN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES.

A COMPLETELY INTEGRATED COMPUTERISED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM IS
DESCRIBED, SUITABLE FOR AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY OR INFORMATION SYSTEM REQUIRING
COMPLETE AND SPEEDY LITERATURE AND INFORMATION PROVISION FOR TEACHING AND
RESEARCH UNITS, QUICK AND EFFICIENT LOAN SYSTEMS AND POSSIBILITIES FOR USING
THE SERVICES OF OTHER ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. WORK IS DIVIDED BETWEEN A MAIN
COMPUTER WITH CENTRALISED FUNCTIONS, ASSISTED BY SMALLER COMPUTERS CONNECTED
ON-LINE AND USED FOR LOCAL FUNCTIONS; COOPERATION OF 2 LIBRARIES VIA THE MAIN
COMPUTER, INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS AND ADMINISTRATION QUESTIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
THE COMPONENTS CAN PRODUCE LOAN AUTOMATION FOR OPEN AND CLOSED ACCESS STOCK,
CATALOGUING AND LITERATURE SEARCHING. THE CONCEPT IS BEING ACHIEVED THROUGH
THE AUTOMATION OF SAARLAND UNIVERSITY, SAARBRUCKEN LIBRARY; SOFTWARE ALREADY
AVAILABLE CAN BE USED.
ORGANIZATION OF SERIALS WORK FOR MANUAL AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS.

IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY CONVINCING RATIONALE OR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF GROUPING SERIALS ACTIVITIES FOR COORDINATION, LIBRARIANS
FIND IT HARD TO CHOOSE AMONG DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES FOR SERIALS
MANAGEMENT. RECOMMENDS THE PRINCIPLE OF RECIPROCAL INTERDEPENDENCE AS A
THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE GROUPING OF SERIALS ACTIVITIES. DESCRIBES A
SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE TO SERIALS MANAGEMENT IN A UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY. AN APPRAISAL OF THE EXPECTED ORGANISATIONAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION
LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A STRUCTURE BASED ON THIS PRINCIPLE WILL BE
EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE FOR AUTOMATION AS FOR MANUAL OPERATION.
A SURVEY OF THE METHODS BY WHICH TEACHERS SELECT BOOKS CONDUCTED IN SHEFFIELD
AND ROTHERHAM IN 1979.

THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED IN 33 SCHOOLS OF ALL TYPES IN SHEFFIELD AND ROTHERHAM,
EXAMINES THE USE MADE BY TEACHERS OF VARIOUS INFORMATION SOURCES IN THE
SELECTION OF SCHOOL BOOKS. THE INFORMATION SOURCES COVERED INCLUDE PUBLISHERS'
SERVICES SUCH AS REPRESENTATIVES, CATALOGUES AND INSPECTION COPIES, VARIOUS
SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDED BY LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES, EXHIBITIONS,
CONFERENCES, BOOK SHOPS AND OTHER SUPPLY AGENCIES, THE MEDIA AND OTHERS.
THE TWO-TIER LIBRARY SYSTEM IN THE REVIEW OF THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND
RESEARCH.

REFLECTIONS ON A POLITICAL SPEECH MADE ON 26 NOV 79 BY THE WEST GERMAN
MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND RESEARCH ON THE OPENING OF THE NEWLY-BUILT LIBRARY
SERVING THE UNIVERSITY OF DUSSELDORF. THE THEME IS WHAT POLICY SHOULD BE
ADOPTED IN PROVIDING BOOKS IN NEW UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES ESTABLISHED OVER
THE PAST 10 YEARS.
THE LITERATURE PROVISION OF AN OLD UNIVERSITY' PROBLEMS OF COORDINATION.

SUMMARY OF THE PROGRAMME DEVELOPED BY THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
HEIDELBERG FOR RATIONALISING ACCESSIONS POLICY, AND SO OVERCOMING THE
TRADITIONAL DUALISM OF OLDER UNIVERSITIES. CRITERIA ARE ESTABLISHED TO
DETERMINE WHICH MATERIAL SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE MAIN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, AND
WHICH TO FACULTY AND DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES.
COOPERATIVE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS' A REPORT.

DESCRIBES THE LIBRARY NETWORKING COMMITTEE'S COOPERATIVE COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, FOCUSING ON WORKSHOPS WHICH MET TO DISCUSS 5 SUBJECT
AREAS WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR COOPERATIVE ACQUISITION IN NORTHERN
VIRGINIA' ART RESOURCES, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH SCIENCE, LAW AND URBAN
AFFAIRS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
HOLDER OF RECORD: A COOPERATIVE HEALTH SCIENCES JOURNAL SYSTEM IN A HOSPITAL
LIBRARY NETWORK.

THE COOPERATIVE ACQUISITION AND RETENTION OF HEALTH SCIENCES JOURNALS BY A
GROUP OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL LIBRARIES IS
DESCRIBED. THE 'HOLDER OF RECORD' SYSTEM EMPHASISES A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT
THAT HAS FREED RESOURCES FOR EXPANSION OF THE GROUP'S JOURNAL HOLDINGS AND
DISTRIBUTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERLIBRARY LOAN AMONG THE LIBRARIES INVOLVED.
SPECIAL TOPICS ON LIBRARY PRACTICES: ACQUISITION.

THE 1ST IN THE QUARTERLY SERIES DEVOTED TO SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF LIBRARY
PRACTICES DEALS WITH ACQUISITION POLICIES AND TECHNIQUES IN THE CZECHOSLOVAK
CENTRALISED SYSTEM OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. AFTER THE THEORETICAL POINTS DISCUSSED

ACQUISITIONS. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRESENTED SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'.
AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS' A BIBLIOGRAPHY.

BIBLIOGRAPHY, WITH 88 REFERENCES, DIVIDED INTO 3 SECTIONS; GENERAL, INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIES AND VENDORS, NETWORKS, PUBLISHERS.
AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS' A SURVEY.

3 CONCEPTS ESSENTIAL IN IMPLEMENTING AN AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM INVOLVE
THE LIBRARY-SUPPLIER CONTRACT, THE SUPPLIER'S INVENTORY, AND SUBSCRIBED
PUBLICATIONS. ON THE BASIS OF THESE CONCEPTS THE AUTHOR PROVIDES A SURVEY FORM
FOR A LIBRARY'S USE IN DETERMINING THE MOST APPROPRIATE SERVICE OR SYSTEM FOR
ITS ACQUISITIONS NEEDS.
THE MISSISSAUGA LIBRARY SYSTEM' A CASE STUDY.

DESCRIBES HOW THE MISSISSAUGA PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS EMPLOYED AN INTEGRATED
ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM AVAILABLE THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEM (UTLAS), DESCRIBING THE SEARCHING, ORDERING, AND
RECEIPT OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.
A CASE STUDY IN AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS' NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF NOTIS (NORTHWESTERN ON-LINE TOTALLY
INTEGRATED SYSTEM) WITH EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED BY ANY LIBRARY PLANNING TO AUTOMATE ACQUISITIONS. THE HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED ARE ALSO NOTED.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION ASPECTS OF AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEMS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE RTSD/AAP JOINT COMMITTEE PROGRAMME 'AUTOMATED
ACQUISITIONS' WHAT'S GOOD? WHAT'S BAD? WHAT'S MISSING?' 27 JUNE 78. DISCUSSES
MANAGEMENT NEEDS FOR TIMELY, APPROPRIATE, AND COMPREHENSIVE ACQUISITIONS
INFORMATION, NOTING THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR SUMMARY AND EXCEPTION REPORTING
MANDATES ON-LINE, NOT OFF-LINE, AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEMS. THE EXTENT TO
WHICH PRESENT SYSTEMS FULFIL THESE NEEDS IS ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF RESPONSES
TO A RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION/ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
PUBLISHERS QUESTIONNAIRE.
JOURNAL SELECTION MODELS' PAST AND PRESENT.

A REVIEW IS GIVEN OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS APPLIED TO JOURNAL SELECTION AND
DECISION PROBLEMS. VARIOUS MODELS ARE EXAMINED, ANALYSED, AND COMPARED. SUCH
FEATURES AS THE SPECIFIC DECISION PROBLEM EXAMINED, DECISION CRITERION,
METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED, AND DATA REQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED. CURRENT RESEARCH AND
PRACTICE ARE EXAMINED TO PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN MATERIALS SELECTION.
MORE TECHNICAL JOURNALS ARE REQUIRED IN LIBRARIES.

SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES CANNOT SUBSCRIBE TO ALL THE TECHNICAL JOURNALS AVAILABLE.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES MUST PARTICIPATE IN THIS. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR TECHNOLOGY
USES SURVEYS OF REFERENCE USE, INTERLENDING AND LENDING IN GENERAL TO ASSIST
IN THE SELECTION OF TITLES. SELECTED LISTS OF TITLES FOR 4 CATEGORIES OF USER
ARE GIVEN' AMATEUR, AMATEUR AND EXPERT, EXPERT, AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE JOURNALS
FOR THE AMATEUR. FINNISH TECHNICAL JOURNALS ARE NOT WELL INDEXED BUT ATTEMPTS
ARE BEING MADE TO IMPROVE THEM.
AN APPLICATION OF INFORMATION THEORY FOR MATERIALS SELECTION AND COLLECTION
EVALUATION.

(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY). STUDY OF THE PROBLEM OF
MATERIALS SELECTION FOR A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SUBJECT COLLECTION. AN OBJECTIVE,
QUANTITATIVE METHOD WAS TESTED WHICH CLASSIFIED BOOKS IN A SAMPLE SCIENCE
COLLECTION, AND WHICH WAS USED TO ASSESS THE COLLECTION AND TO AID IN THE
SELECTION DECISION. RELATEDNESS OF DOCUMENTS WAS PRESENTED AS A SELECTION AND
ASSESSMENT CRITERION. SINGLE-LINK CLUSTERING AND THE BRILLOUIN INFORMATION
MEASURE WERE USED.
SELECTED LIST OF BOOKS AND JOURNALS FOR A SMALL DENTAL LIBRARY.

SUBJECT LIST OF 116 DENTAL BOOKS AND 20 DENTAL JOURNALS, INTENDED TO HELP THE
DENTAL BOOK COMMITTEE AND THE LIBRARIAN OF A SMALL HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY
ACHIEVE A BALANCED DENTAL COLLECTION. THE TOTAL COST OF THE COLLECTION IS
$3,150.88. AN AUTHOR INDEX IS ALSO PROVIDED.
THE FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN THE CHOICE CARD SELECTION' A SURVEY OF THEIR
REACTIONS IN A LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE.

REPORT OF A STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE BEHREND COLLEGE, PENNSYLVANIA STATE
UNIVERSITY, PARTICIPATION IN THE CHOICE CARD SELECTION. A 3-MONTH OBSERVATION
OF THE FACULTY RESPONSE TO THE CHOICE CARD DISTRIBUTION REVEALED THAT IT TOOK
4-14 DAYS FOR FACULTY MEMBERS TO RETURN CARDS; RETURN RATE IS VERY HIGH; AND
PERCENTAGE OF BOOKS SELECTED VARIES BY DISCIPLINE. INTERVIEWS WITH FACULTY
MEMBERS SHOWED THAT CHOICE CARDS WERE FELT TO BE INFORMATIVE AND UP TO DATE.
BOOK REVIEWS ARE HELPFUL ALTHOUGH SOME SUSPECTED THEIR RELIABILITY. IT WAS
RECOMMENDED THAT EACH TITLE BE REVIEWED BY 2 QUALIFIED REVIEWERS, AND THAT THE
LIBRARY SHOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE CARDS.
PLACING AND TRACING ORDERS IN A DYNAMIC ACQUISITIONS PROCESS.

1 OF THE MOST USEFUL MEASURES OF THE PERFORMANCE OF A BOOK ORDER DEPARTMENT IS
THE RATE OF RETURN. THIS GIVES A MEASURE OF THE RATE AT WHICH ORDERS, PLACED
FOR BOOKS, ARE FULFILLED AND THE BOOKS RECEIVED. GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE USE
OF A COMPUTERISED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM, AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED, TO OBTAIN DATA ON A
REGULAR BASIS REGARDING BOOK ORDERS.
BOOKS ON APPROVAL-AN ANALYSIS WITH REFERENCE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ACQUISITION.

DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF 'ON APPROVAL' BOOK SELECTION, HIGHLIGHTING THE
OBSERVATIONS OF THE UK PARRY COMMITTEE AND S.R. RANGANATHAN. WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, LISTS THE VARIOUS METHODS OF OBTAINING
BOOKS ON APPROVAL, IDENTIFIES THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, AND SUGGESTS
MEASURES TO CONTROL THE WEAK POINTS OF THE ON APPROVAL SYSTEM. STATES THAT NO
MORE THAN 1/3 OF THE BOOK GRANT SHOULD BE USED ON THIS ACQUISITION METHOD.
NIGERIAN LEGAL DEPOSIT PUBLICATIONS.

DISCUSSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH NIGERIAN PUBLISHERS COMPLY WITH LEGAL DEPOSIT
LAWS, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE MATERIALS FOR EFFECTIVE
UTILISATION. FROM THE NATURE OF THESE MATERIALS, THEIR IMPACT ON THE
TECHNOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE COUNTRY IS ALSO DISCUSSED.
EXAMINES THE LAWS WITH THE AIM OF HIGHLIGHTING WHAT FACTORS CAN BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE NON-UTILISATION OR UNDER-UTILISATION OF THE MATERIALS.
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITIES OF THE SECTION ON EXCHANGE AND ACQUISITION.

ANALYSIS OF 50 YEARS OF THIS IFLA SECTION'S ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF
EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE LAST DECADE. LISTS THE
RESULTS OF 2 EUROPEAN EXCHANGE CONFERENCES (1960 AND 72); THE BOOKS PRINTED
AND PLANNED BY STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE SECTION; AND PAPERS READ AT
IFLA CONFERENCES, PRINTED, DUPLICATED AND PLANNED. INCLUDES AN OUTLOOK ON THE
NEXT 5 YEARS.
MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXCHANGE' A HOSPITAL VANTAGEPOINT.

IN AUTUMN 79, A STUDY OF THE MLA EXCHANGE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE VETERANS
ADMINISTRATION MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, TO DETERMINE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TITLES
REQUESTED WERE ACTUALLY RECEIVED AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR TRANSACTIONS TO BE
COMPLETED BETWEEN DONOR AND RECIPIENT. EXPLAINS THE STUDY PROCEDURE. IT WAS
FOUND THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE TITLES REQUESTED WERE RECEIVED, COMPARABLE TO
ANOTHER STUDY REPORTED IN 1977. A MEDIAN OF FROM 26.4 TO 27.5 DAYS BETWEEN
REQUEST AND RECEIPT FOR ACADEMIC AND HOSPITAL DONORS RESPECTIVELY, WAS
ACHIEVED. DISCUSSES THE EXCHANGE IN GENERAL, ALTERNATE MEANS OF ACQUIRING
MISSING ISSUES, AND AIM VERSUS NON-AIM TITLES OFFERED BY DONORS.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING AROUND THE WORLD-A REVIEW OF RECENT PAPERS-XI.

THE REVIEW IS INTRODUCED BY A SURVEY ON THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS
LIBRARY FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING INTERLIBRARY LENDING. VARIOUS NATIONAL LIBRARY
SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE DEGREE OF CENTRALISATION
INVOLVED. A CENTRAL LENDING COLLECTION IS PROPOSED FOR FRANCE. BOTH
DECENTRALISED AND CENTRALISED SOLUTIONS ARE PUT FORWARD FOR INDIA AND JAPAN.
THE LATTER ALSO CLAIMS AN INTERNATIONAL ROLE. UNPLANNED DECENTRALISED SYSTEMS
IN THE NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM ARE DESCRIBED, AND THE PLANNED DECENTRALISED
SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IS DEFENDED. BRIEFLY CONSIDERS THE
ACCURACY OF LOCATION INFORMATION IN THE USA. A NUMBER OF ITEMS ON INTERLENDING
IN AUSTRALIA ARE REVIEWED, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW
VOUCHER PAYMENT SYSTEM.
THE CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS NOW OPENED.

THE 1ST PLANS FOR ESTABLISHING THE CENTRAL LIBRARY DATE FROM 1911. ITS DUTIES
ARE' ACQUISITION AND PRESERVATION OF A REPRESENTATIVE COLLECTION; MAKING THIS
COLLECTION AVAILABLE THROUGH INTERLIBRARY LOANS; COOPERATION WITH PROVINCIAL
LIBRARIES; ORGANISATION OF INFORMATION SESSIONS; AND ACQUISITION OF LITERATURE
DEALING WITH LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY IS CONNECTED WITH THE
HELSINKI CITY LIBRARIES. THUS THEIR COLLECTIONS OF ABOUT 11,700,000 VOLUMES
ARE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THROUGH INTERLENDING.
A VIEW FROM ZAMBIA.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN ZAMBIA, ACQUISITIONS ARE CENTRALISED, WHICH CAN LEAD
TO UNSUITABLE SELECTION FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY RECEIVES
MOST FUNDS, WHILE OTHER LIBRARIES SUFFER, AND THERE ARE FEW GOOD BOOKSHOPS.
INTERLENDING IS FOCUSED ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, AND ATTEMPTS TO
CREATE A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE HAVE FAILED SO FAR. DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS
HIGH, BUT LIBRARIANS' STATUS IS LOW. INTERLENDING COULD BE BASED ON EXISTING
RESEARCH COLLECTIONS, BUT A CENTRAL COLLECTION OF JOURNALS WOULD BE COSTLY AND
PREMATURE.
A VIEW FROM BARBADOS.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. INTERLENDING IN BARBADOS IS ASSISTED BY THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY OF THE MAJOR LIBRARIES, WHICH HAVE GOOD TELEPHONE LINKS.
INTERNATIONAL REQUESTS ARE ROUTED VIA THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST INDIES LIBRARY TO
THE BLLD FOR JOURNALS, BUT TO A WIDER SELECTION OF LIBRARIES FOR MONOGRAPHS.
THE CHOICE IS DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING FOR MONOGRAPH REQUESTS, AND
AUTOMATED UNION CATALOGUES PRODUCED IN OTHER COUNTRIES COULD HELP IN THIS
RESPECT. SMALL COLLECTIONS OF PERIODICALS SATISFY A HIGH PROPORTION OF DEMAND,
BUT ACTUAL TITLES REMAIN TO BE IDENTIFIED.
SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES).F

OR ABSTRACTS OF THE 2 PAPERS IN THIS SECTION (ONE ON BARBADOS, THE OTHER ON
ZAMBIA), SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS:.
INTERLIBRARY BORROWING' COSTS AND BENEFITS.

AN ASSESSMENT IS NEEDED OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE COST OF OBTAINING
MATERIAL ON INTERLIBRARY LOAN. THE MAIN INTERNAL LIBRARY RESOURCE INVOLVED IS
STAFF TIME, WHICH MUST BE USED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. DISCUSSES COSTS
PER LOAN, CHARGES FOR SERVICE, AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARIES
SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERLENDING SERVICE BY
CONCENTRATING ON ITEMS WHICH USERS REALLY NEED AND BY ASSESSING CAREFULLY WHEN
INTERLOANS ARE MOST BENEFICIAL. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS
THE EFFECTS OF NEW PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGIES AT LOCAL LEVEL ON THE SCHOLARLY
AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.
INVENTORY EXPERIENCE IN A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

ASSESSES THE BENEFITS OF COLLECTION INVENTORY, DRAWING ON 3 INVENTORIES FROM A
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF PROCEDURES USED FOR PERIODICALS,
MONOGRAPHS, AND MICROTEXTS, WITH SOME INDICATION OF THE COSTS AND LABOUR
INVOLVED. THE RESULTING IMPROVEMENTS TO SERVICES ARE ESTIMATED FROM THE
PROPORTION OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION DEFECTS RECTIFIED. GENERAL
PRINCIPLES, PROCEDURES, AND STATISTICAL OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED, AND IN
CONCLUSION THE MINOR INCONVENIENCES OF INVENTORY ARE DISCOUNTED IN THE LIGHT
OF ITS ADVANTAGES. AN ANALYTICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE LITERATURE ON INVENTORIES
IS APPENDED.
IDENTIFICATION OF STORAGE CANDIDATES AMONG MONOGRAPHS.

INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBILITY OF CONSTRUCTING AN ALGORITHM FOR ALLOCATING
MONOGRAPHS FROM THE SHELVES OF THE WASHINGTON STATE LIBRARY TO STORAGE,
MINIMISING THE PROBABILITY OF THE MATERIALS' BEING RECALLED BY USER DEMAND.
THE METHOD CAN PROVIDE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FOR A DECISION AS TO DESIRED
USER SATISFACTION AND CAN INDICATE THE CONSEQUENT SIZE OF THE CORE COLLECTION
AND OF THE STORED COLLECTION.
THE SELF-RENEWING LIBRARY.

REVIEWS THE BACKGROUND TO THE ATKINSON REPORT (CAPITAL PROVISION FOR
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' REPORT OF A WORKING PARTY, LONDON, HMSO, 1976; SEE
76/3409); THE VERSION OF THE SELF-RENEWING LIBRARY PUT FORWARD BY THE REPORT;
THE DEBATE FOLLOWING THE REPORT'S PUBLICATION; AND THE FUTURE.
THE EFFICACITY OF INDEXING SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO UNDER-USAGE OF DOCUMENTATION.

AN EDITED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES
BIBLIOTHECAIRES PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE. THE PROBLEM OF UNDER-USAGE IS
GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO OBSOLESCENCE OF DOCUMENTATION AND SOLVED BY WEEDING.
THE PHENOMENON IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ENTROPY OF A DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM IS
ALSO A RESULT OF INADEQUACIES IN INDEXING, SELECTION SERVICES, AND USER
TRAINING. THE REASONS FOR DECIDING THAT MATERIAL IS OUT OF DATE AND CLOGGING
THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL, TO SHOW HOW MORE EFFICIENT
DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT CAN INCREASE USAGE.
MUST ALL PRINTED LIBRARY MATERIAL BE ACID FREE?.

GIVES GENERAL BACKGROUND ABOUT ACID-FREE PAPER AND AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHY
CHANGES TO ALKALINE OR NEUTRAL PAPER ARE NOT IMMINENT, OR EVER NEEDED AT ALL.
OFFERS SUGGESTIONS TO LIBRARIANS WHO WISH TO SECURE PRESENT AND FUTURE TITLES
ON ACID-FREE PAPER.
PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.

PROCEEDINGS OF A SEMINAR SPONSORED BY THE LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE AND THE
PRINCETON-TRENTON CHAPTER OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION, RUTGERS
UNIVERSITY, 20-21 JULY 79. INCLUDED ARE PAPERS ON HOUSEKEEPING, LIBRARY
BINDING, BOOK MAKING AND BINDING, DEACIDIFICATION, AND MICROFORMS. TEXT OF A
PANEL DISCUSSION, AND A LIST OF AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS FOR THE TEACHING OF
PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS ARE ALSO INCLUDED.
CONSERVATION IN MUSIC LIBRARIES.

AN UPDATED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AS A JOINT REPORT TO THE RESEARCH
LIBRARIES COMMISSION AT THE 11TH CONGRESS OF THE IAML, MAINZ, 1977. DISCUSSES
HOW THE DETERIORATION OF BOOKS AND PAPER CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY'
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS; THE INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIALS USED;
MECHANICAL FACTORS (I.E. GENERAL WEAR AND TEAR); AND BIOLOGICAL FACTORS
(ATTACKS BY FUNGI, INSECTS, ETC.). DESCRIBES BRIEFLY SOME OF THE MAJOR
CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DEACIDIFICATION AND LAMINATION. SUGGESTS A
NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS CAN INSTIGATE CONSERVATION MEASURES IN
THEIR OWN LIBRARIES, AND MENTIONS SOME REMEDIES THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED. NOTES
THE STEPS WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARDS SETTING UP INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL
COOPERATIVE PRESERVATION PROGRAMMES.
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT IS IMPETUS FOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM.

PRESENTS A PLANNING DOCUMENT' THE CONSERVATION PLANNING PROPOSAL, DEVELOPED
FOR A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S SPECIAL COLLECTIONS, AND BASED ON RESEARCH FOR A
CONSERVATION PROGRAMME AT THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHIA,
PENNSYLVANIA. THE PLANNING PROCESS COMPRISES 3 ASPECTS' (1) THE PRESERVATION
AND RESTORATION OF PRE-1840 VALUABLE 'RARE BOOKS'; (2) MICROFILMING OF
BRITTLE, ACIDIC PRE-1840 WORKS; AND (3) THE MAINTENANCE OF TODAY'S BOOKS, WITH
A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 30-50 YEARS, FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.
CONSERVATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS AT THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE.

DESCRIBES THE PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTION IN THE HISTORICAL MONUMENTS SECTION OF THE
FRENCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR A CONSERVATION CENTRE,
EMPLOYING THE LATEST TECHNIQUES IN CONSERVATION, RESTORATION, AND PRINTING
FROM OLD NEGATIVES.
A BINDING AUDIT FROM THE LIBRARIANS' VIEWPOINT.

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO BINDING LIBRARY MATERIALS, WITH A PROCEDURES FLOWCHART,
WITH SECTIONS ON CHOOSING A BINDER, TYPES OF BINDING, PREPARATION OF
MATERIALS, THE PHYSICAL BINDING PROCESS, AND THE EXAMINATION OF BINDING.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE'S STANDARDS FOR BINDING.
SERVICES OFFERED BY CERTIFIED LIBRARY BINDERS.

CHART DESIGNED AS A HANDY REFERENCE TOOL FOR LIBRARIANS SELECTION OF CERTIFIED
LIBRARY BINDERS. BY EACH BINDER'S NAME, DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF BINDING, SPECIAL
WORK, SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT OFFERED. BINDER'S ADDRESSES ARE ALSO PROVIDED.
AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO COVER MATERIALS FOR CLASS 'A' LIBRARY BINDING.

DESCRIBES RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY WHITMAN PRODUCTS, LTD., RHODE ISLAND, INTO
ALTERNATE APPROACHES TO COVER MATERIALS FOR CLASS 'A' LIBRARY BINDING (WHICH
IS ENDORSED BY THE US LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE). CLASS 'A' COVER MATERIALS
HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LIMITED TO GROUP F BUCKRAM, BUT MANY NON-WOVEN SUBSTRATES
ARE AVAILABLE, INCLUDING CELLULOSE FIBRES REINFORCED WITH A SYNTHETIC RESIN IN
LATEX FORM. THESE HAVE, HOWEVER, BEEN DEFICIENT IN THE BOOK'S SPINE AREA.
WHITMAN HAS WORKED WITH A TYPE II GRADE NON-WOVEN BASE WITH SPINE
REINFORCEMENT USING POLYESTER SCRIMS. IT IS FELT THAT THE NEW APPROACH OFFERS
SUFFICIENT ADVANTAGES TO JUSTIFY AN EFFORT BY BINDERIES AND OTHERS TO DEVELOP
THE EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES TO MAKE THIS A VIABLE, PROFITABLE CLASS 'A'
LIBRARY BINDING ADHESIVE.
ELECTRONIC THEFT DETECTION SYSTEMS' A SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 1976. PART III' HIGH
SCHOOL LIBRARIES.

REPORTS ON THE USE OF ELECTRONIC THEFT DETECTION SYSTEMS IN 25 HIGH SCHOOL
LIBRARIES IN THE USA AND CANADA, LISTING THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS AVAILABLE AND
THEIR COSTS, AND REPORTING ON REACTIONS TO THE SYSTEMS IN OPERATION.
BOOK LOSSES FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES' THE NATIONAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE.

THE COMMONEST REASONS FOR BOOK LOSSES FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE THEFT,
NON-RETURN OF BOOKS, AND LOSSES WHILST ON LOAN TO READERS. THEFTS MAY BE
PREVENTED BY SUCH MEASURES AS CLOSED ACCESS SYSTEMS, BETTER READER
SUPERVISION, SECURITY DEVICES AND LIBRARY USER EDUCATION; NON-RETURN MAY BE
COMBATTED BY BETTER MEMBERSHIP REGISTRATION AND ISSUE PROCEDURES, REVISION OF
FINES, OR LEGAL ACTION; AND LOSSES BY BORROWERS ARE OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE
CONTROL OF THE LIBRARIAN.
CIRCULATION VERSUS PHOTOCOPY: QUID PRO QUO?.

INFORMATION THOUGHT NECESSARY FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A LIMITED
JOURNAL CIRCULATION POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO,
INCLUDED THE EFFECTS ON SEATING, ON IN-HOUSE PHOTOCOPYING, AND ON CIRCULATION.
AN INITIAL ONE-WEEK SURVEY SHOWED JOURNAL CIRCULATION TO BE 7% OF THE TOTAL,
WITH JOURNALS ISSUED DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS COMPRISING 45% OF THE TOTAL. A
SURVEY OF USER PHOTOCOPYING PRACTICE SUGGESTED THAT CIRCULATION LIMITED TO
JOURNALS OVER 5 YEARS OLD MIGHT RESULT IN A 90% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING, AND
CIRCULATION SURVEY WERE USED TO PREDICT A 45% DECREASE IN CIRCULATION. RESULTS
OF IMPLEMENTING A LIMITED CIRCULATION POLICY WERE A 41% CIRCULATION DECREASE
AND A 136% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTION AND
RESULTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EFFECT OF DUPLICATE COPY SUBSCRIPTIONS AND
BY PROVISION OF CONVENIENT PHOTOCOPY FACILITIES.
AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS VIS-A-VIS AUTOMATED CATALOGUING.

AN AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOPED WITHOUT DUE REGARD TO
AN EXISTING AUTOMATED CATALOGUING SYSTEM. ABOVE ALL, THERE SHOULD BE THE
FACILITY FOR DATA EXCHANGE, TO PRODUCE MACHINE-READABLE BOOK LABELS, AND TO
ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY FILES WITHOUT DUPLICATION OF DATA. THERE ARE PROBLEMS,
HOWEVER, AS CATALOGUE AND LENDING ARE BASED UPON TITLE-ENTRY AND BOOK AS
PHYSICAL UNIT RESPECTIVELY, AND FURTHER, THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF TITLE-ENTRY
AND CALL NUMBER. VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF THE SYSTEM MAKE IT NECESSARY TO CONNECT
DIFFERENT BOOK UNITS ACCORDING TO TITLE ENTRY. A SHORT TITLE IS NECESSARY FOR
OVERDUE NOTICES. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM CATALOGUING WITH AN
OFF-LINE SYSTEM, WHILST USING AN ON-LINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM.
COMPUTER-AIDED MANAGEMENT OF REQUESTS FOR PHOTOCOPIES RECEIVED BY A
DOCUMENTATION CENTRE' ANNUAL REPORT AND STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.

DESCRIBES A METHOD FOR STUDYING, BY COMPUTER, REQUESTS TO INFORMATION CENTRES
AND LIBRARIES FOR TECHNICAL LITERATURE. DETAILS OF THE REQUESTS, SUCH AS
PERIODICAL TITLE, DATE OF PUBLICATION, SOURCE OF SUPPLY, LANGUAGE, ETC. ARE
STORED, COUNTED, RANKED AND COMPARED TO ALLOW ANNUAL ASSESSMENT TO BE MADE OF
FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SPREAD BETWEEN VARIOUS TYPES OF REQUESTS.
CLOSING CATALOGING-AID BOOKS' PUT THEM ON-LINE.

CATALOGUING AIDS ARE NOW MOSTLY IN BOOK-FORM. PRESENT AND FUTURE PROBLEMS OF
CATALOGUING PRACTICE IN RELATION TO CATALOGUING-AID BOOKS ARE DISCUSSED, AS IS
THE CATALOGUER'S ROLE IN THE CATALOGUING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME. RECOMMENDS
THAT CATALOGUING-AID BOOKS BE PUT ON-LINE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE CATALOGUER'S
EFFICIENCY AND CONSISTENCY SO AS TO CONTRIBUTE BETTER QUALITY CATALOGUING
RECORDS TO THE ON-LINE CENTRAL DATA BASES, WITH THE EVENTUAL ACHIEVEMENT OF A
TRUE SHARED CATALOGUING SYSTEM.
GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.

LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,
AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THE
BULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A
CERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONAL
LITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1 CATALOGUE CARD IS USED
FOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC
PREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN
1977. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT
GROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF CATALOGUING, DECREASE LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND REDUCE THE SIZE
OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES.
THE PRESENT STATE OF STANDARDIZATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION IN THE USSR'
THE WORK OF THE USSR JOINT CATALOGUING COMMITTEE.

PRESENTS DEVELOPMENTS IN CATALOGUING IN THE USSR IN THE LATE 1960S AND 1970S.
OUTLINES USSR REACTIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DESCRIPTIONS, SHOWS THE TREND IN THE USSR OF PREPARING CATALOGUING RULES AS
NATIONAL STANDARDS, AND THE ROLE OF THE JOINT CATALOGUING COMMITTEE IN
PREPARING THE WHOLE RANGE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS.
CATALOGUING INDIAN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS' A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND
HISTORICAL STUDY.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO INDIA. SETS OUT THE PROBLEMS IN THE
CATALOGUING OF INDIAN ENGLISH LANGUAGE PERIODICALS AT THE INDIA OFFICE
LIBRARY, LONDON, WHICH POSSESSES THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE
SOUTH ASIAN NEWSPAPERS WITH MANY RARE AND UNIQUE ITEMS.
CATALOGUE OF PRINTED MUSIC IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY TO 1980.

TRACES THE HISTORY OF THE MUSIC COLLECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PRINTED BOOKS,
TRANSFERRED TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY REFERENCE DIVISION IN 1973, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO THE LACK OF A CATALOGUE OF THE COLLECTION UNTIL NOW, WHEN A
PROJECT HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY K.G. SAUR TO PUBLISH THE CATALOGUE OF PRINTED
MUSIC IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY TO 1980.
COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING SYSTEM-REGIONAL OR NATIONAL.

EXTENSIVE TREATMENT COVERING THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THEORY AND PRACTICE. THE
MAIN POINTS ARE THE GENERAL AND SPECIFIC CRITICISMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PUT
FORWARD BY THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY, AND THE FUNCTION, PERFORMANCE AND
COSTS OF A NATIONAL COOPERATIVE SYSTEM COMPARED WITH 7 INDEPENDENT REGIONAL
CATALOGUING SYSTEMS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE A NATIONAL SYSTEM WOULD OFFER
MANY TECHNICAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ADVANTAGES, THERE IS NO NATIONAL CONSENSUS
FOR ITS ESTABLISHMENT.
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES' AN AUTOMATION APPROACH TO
CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING.

TAKES AS A CONCEPTUAL PERSPECTIVE THE USE OF DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO
REPLACE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES OF CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING. ALL ENTRIES
WILL BE MAIN ENTRIES SO AS TO PROVIDE MULTI-ACCESS POINTS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
INFORMATION. CODING FOR MACHINE ENTRY WILL BE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A
PUBLICATION, SUCH AS SUBJECT CODE, AUTHOR, TITLE AND DATE. KWIC, BASED ON A
MATCH OF CONTENTS AND USAGE PATTERNS, WILL REPLACE THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OR
SEAR'S SUBJECT HEADINGS.
A COMPUTER-PRODUCED SERIALS BOOK CATALOG WITH AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED INDEXES.

THE SERIALS BOOK CATALOGUE AT THE IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PROVIDES
ACCESS TO 33,000 SERIAL RECORDS BY TITLES, CORPORATE BODIES AND SUBJECT
HEADINGS. ACCESS POINTS ARE GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY FROM THE CENTRAL SERIALS
DATA BASE BY A UNIQUE, LOCALLY WRITTEN COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS GREAT
FLEXIBILITY IN RECORDS MANIPULATION. LOCAL CONTROL OF CATALOGUE PRODUCTION
PERMITS EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM FORMAT BY THE CREATION OF LOCAL TAGS AND
LINKAGE TO RELATED MONOGRAPH RECORDS IN THE CARD CATALOGUE, WHILE PROVIDING A
BASIS FOR FURTHER AUTOMATION OF SERIALS CONTROL.
ISSUE DEVOTED TO A ONE DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81).T

HE PURPOSE OF THE SEMINAR WAS TO INTRODUCE THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM TO LIBRARIANS NOT ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH IT. FOR ABSTRACTS
OF THE 5 PAPERS REPRINTED HERE, SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
THE ULSCS' THE LRCC ROLE.

PAPER PRESENTED AT A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81. DESCRIBES THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY RESOURCES
CO-ORDINATING COMMITTEE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ULSCS. THE ULSCS IS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LRCC THROUGH ITS STANDING ADVISORY PANEL ON LIBRARY
AUTOMATION (SAPLA) AND THE CATALOGUERS' LIAISON GROUP (CLG) FORMERLY KNOWN AS
THE CATALOGUERS' WORKING PARTY. ALSO DESCRIBED ARE OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY
LRCC STAFF, AND A SUMMARY OF THE BENEFITS OF JOINING THE ULSCS.
THE ULSCS' THE BRITISH LIBRARY ROLE.

PAPER PRESENTED AT A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81. ULSCS OPERATES WITHIN THE BLAISE LOCAL CATALOGUE
SERVICE (LOCAS) SYSTEM AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S ROLE CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO
5 FUNCTIONS' (1) HOLDING THE DATA BASES; (2) HOLDING THE ULSCS FILE; (3)
PROCESSING THE ULSCS FILE; (4) PRODUCING OUTPUTS; AND (5) PROVIDING CUSTOMER
SUPPORT AND AUXILIARY SERVICES. EACH FUNCTION IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
FUTURE PLANS FOR THE ULSCS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81. ULSCS IS MERELY A MEANS TO AN END-THAT BEING A
UNIVERSITY-WIDE NETWORK FOR RESOURCE SHARING IN LIBRARIES. THE SYSTEM WILL
PROVIDE MANY ELEMENTS NEEDED FOR A COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONS PROGRAMME, A
SHARED DATA BASE TO WHICH ALL THE SYSTEM'S LIBRARIES WILL CONTRIBUTE, AND USER
ACCESS WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT OF AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THE
SYSTEM SHOULD, HOWEVER BE SEEN IN ITS PLACE IN THE NATIONAL NETWORK, AND IT
WILL BE ACCESSED ALONG WITH THE MARC FILES AND SAVE A GEAT DEAL OF TIME.
DEVELOPMENTS IN BLAISE/LOCAS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81. REVIEW OF CURRENT AND LIKELY FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
IN BLAISE-LOCAS, WHICH INCLUDE' THE USE OF THE BLAISE ON-LINE SYSTEM IN THE
CONTEXT OF LOCAS; USE BY LOCAS USERS OF THE EDITOR; AMENDMENT OF UKMARC AND
LCMARC RECORDS, THEIR CREATION AND THEIR DELETION.
NETWORK DEVELOPMENTS AND FUTURE TRENDS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81. SUMMARY OF THE AUTHOR'S PAPER, WHICH SURVEYED
THE US AND EUROPEAN NETWORK SCENE, AND OUTLINED THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE
NETWORKS IN THE UK, STRESSING THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ANTICIPATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UK
NATIONAL DATA BASE INCORPORATING ALL LOCALLY GENERATED EMMA RECORDS. DISCUSSES
CATALOGUING AND ON-LINE COSTS, AND LOOKS TO THE FUTURE OF FAULT-TOLERANT,
SELF-REPAIRING CYBERNETIC SYSTEMS.
SAP-A NEW WAY TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS.

WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP), AT LUND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, SWEDEN, A NEW VERSION OF ON-LINE CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHS HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED. USING THE SAP-INDEXING METHOD, EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHIC CATALOGUE
RECORDS HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITH SELECTED TERMS FROM CONTENTS TABLES AND BOOK
INDEXES. THE IDEA OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN
FROM THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF A PUBLICATION'S 'INHERENT'
ATTRIBUTES. IT IS ALSO AN APPROACH TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEMS IN DESCRIBING A BOOK'S CONTENTS BY MEANS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION CODES. BY SAP, LOW COST RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR
MONOGRAPH USERS.

FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS ON ROMANIZATION' SAUDI ARABIA.

DEPLORES THE ROMANISATION OF ARABIC CHARACTERS IN ORDER THAT CATALOGUE ENTRIES
FOR ARABIC LITERATURE CAN BE FILED IN THE SAME SEQUENCE AS THOSE FOR WESTERN
LITERATURE. MAINTAINS THAT ARABIC ENTRIES SHOULD BE IN A SEPARATE SEQUENCE,
AND THAT ROMANISATION IS UNNECESSARY. LINGUISTIC EQUALITY SHOULD BE A BASIS
FOR THE FORGING OF NEW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ARAB AND THE WESTERN WORLDS.

CONSIDERED.
AUTHORITY SYSTEMS 2. PROBLEMS IN ESTABLISHING A NAME FILE FOR NIGERIAN AUTHORS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SESSION OF THE SECTION ON CATALOGUING, IFLA
CONFERENCE, COPENHAGEN, 1979. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS IN ESTABLISHING A CATALOGUING
AUTHORITY FILE FOR NIGERIAN NAMES, POSED BY THE INCIDENCE OF PERSONAL NAMES,
HONORIFICS, THE COMBINATION OF A PERSONAL NAME WITH A FAMILY OR PLACE NAME,
AND APPELLATIONS ATTACHED TO THE NAME MOHAMMED. LIBRARIANS MUST COOPERATE WITH
PUBLISHERS AND THE AUTHORS THEMSELVES TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM. ONE
SUCH SOLUTION MAY BE THE CAPITALISATION OF THE ENTRY PART OF THE NAME ON THE
TITLE PAGE OF A WORK, WHICH WOULD GREATLY ASSIST ALL NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL USERS OF NIGERIA'S CATALOGUES AND NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
AACR 2: A CRITICAL STUDY (IN CHINESE).

MANY LIBRARIES IN TAIWAN USE AACR SO CATALOGUING PRACTICE WILL BE GREATLY
AFFECTED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AACR 2 AND THE CLOSING OF THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS CARD CATALOGUE IN JAN 81. PROVIDES A CRITICAL REVIEW OF AACR 2 BY
COMPARING THE MERITS AND DEFECTS OF THE 2 EDITIONS.
AACR2 AND ITS IMPACT ON LIBRARIES' PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF OHIO ANNUAL MEETING AND CONFERENCE ON OCTOBER 12, 1979,
WORTHINGTON, OHIO.

(EDITED BY PAULINE R. BEAN AND SHARON G. FULLERTON.) PAPERS ARE AS FOLLOWS'
AACR 2' THE 'NEW' CODE-HOW, WHY, AND SO WHAT, BY JOAN M. REPP; AACR 2'
PLANNING FOR THE CHANGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI, BY ELEANOR L.
HEISHMAN; OCLC AND AACR 2, BY PATRICK J. MULLIN; AND AACR 2'S IMPACT ON
LIBRARY SERVICE' A SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY, BY NEAL L. EDGAR.
SERIALS CATALOGUING IN AACR 2 (IN CHINESE).

LIKE ISBD, AACR 2 REQUIRES ALL TYPES OF MATERIAL, INCLUDING SERIALS TO BE
CATALOGUED UNDER ONE GENERAL RULE. CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE ALMOST NO SPECIAL
RULES FOR SERIALS IN AACR 2. EXPLAINS THE RULES WITH REGARD TO SERIALS
CATALOGUING AREA BY AREA, FROM THE CHOICE OF MAIN ENTRY TO NOTES. A COMPARISON
IS MADE BETWEEN AACR 2 AND AACR. CONCLUDES THAT SERIALS CATALOGUING IS EASING
USING AACR 2.
ON THE FORMATION OF THE SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING PRINTED MUSIC FOR RAK.

WORK ON THE SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING THE CATALOGUING OF BOTH PRINTED MUSIC AND
SOUND RECORDINGS WHICH WILL BE A SUPPLEMENT TO RAK (REGELN FUR DIE
ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG-RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) IS ALMOST
COMPLETE. IT WILL BE KNOWN AS RAK-MUSIK. WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT SINCE 1971
BY A COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE'S COMMISSION FOR
ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING. TERMS USED IN RAK WERE REPLACED WITH SIMILAR ONES
FROM THE WORLD OF MUSIC AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. DURING THE PREPARATION PERIOD
SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS APPEARED WHICH WERE USED IN COMPILING THE RULES. THE ISBD
(INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION) FOR NON-BOOK MATERIAL WAS
PUBLISHED IN PARTS BETWEEN 1977-79. ALTHOUGH THE SECTION ON SOUND RECORDINGS
WAS NOT DETAILED ENOUGH, THE ISBD (PRINTED MUSIC) WAS SO COMPLEX THAT ONLY
SOME PARTS WERE SELECTED FOR INCLUSION. IN FUTURE THE RAK MUSIC RULES SHOULD
PROVIDE A BASIS FOR MUSIC CATALOGUING.
UNION CATALOGUES TO FOREIGN LITERATURE IN UZBEKISTAN.

UNION CATALOGUES PREPARED BY THE STATE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY
OF THE USSR ARE A USEFUL TOOL FOR THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN
LITERATURE, HOWEVER, THESE CATALOGUES COVER ONLY THE STOCK OF 15 OUT OF THE 50
UZBEKISTAN LIBRARIES. THE UNION INDEXES PREPARED BY UZBEKISTAN LIBRARIES ARE
THEREFORE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. DISCUSSES THE UNION INDEXES TO FOREIGN
LITERATURE PREPARED BY AND AVAILABLE IN UZBEKISTAN LIBRARIES WHICH ARE USED
FOR COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN LITERATURE. AMONGST THESE ARE:
UNION INDEX TO FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND UNION INDEX TO NEW FOREIGN BOOKS
PUBLISHED BY THE MAIN LIBRARY OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UZBEKISTAN
SSR, UNION INDEX TO FOREIGN MEDICAL PERIODICALS PREPARED BY THE NATIONAL
MEDICAL LIBRARY AND 2 UNION INDEXES PREPARED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY, NAMELY CARD INDEX TO FOREIGN PERIODICALS (COVERS THE PERIOD
1880-1967) AND UNION INDEX TO FORE IGN PERIODICALS HELD BY UZBEKISTAN
LIBRARIES (FROM 1968 ONWARDS).
THE GRENOBLE INTER-REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM USED BY THE INTERUNIVERSITY LIBRARY TO PRODUCE THE
2ND EDITION IN 4 VOLUMES, PUBLISHED IN 1979, WHICH COVERS THE HOLDINGS OF 528
CENTRES IN THE REGION. A BRIEF ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
OF THE PROJECT. THE ACTUAL SYSTEM NOW USED IS PRESENTED WITH FULL DETAILS OF
THE 2 PROGRAMMES WHICH OPERATE AND HOW THEY STRUCTURE THE INPUT, AND THE
VARIOUS PRODUCTS OF THE SYSTEM. THE REQUIREMENTS FROM NEW CENTRES JOINING THE
SYSTEM ARE LISTED, AND FUTURE PLANS OUTLINED.
MODULAR INDEXING IN A RELATIONALLY BASED DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.

WHEN BASED ON A SINGLE MODEL, A DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM MAY BE COHERENTLY
DESIGNED, CONVENIENT TO USE, AND EASY TO MAINTAIN. THE RELATIONAL MODEL
PROVIDES A NATURAL WAY OF VIEWING DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL AND HAS A SOUND
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION. A PARTICULAR AREA OF INTEREST IS INDEXING. ALL
INDEXINGTOOLS (INCLUDING NEGATIVE DICTIONARIES, STEM DICTIONARIES, AND
THESAURI) ARE STORED AS RELATIONS AND ARE MANIPULATED USING RELATIONAL
OPERATIONS. THIS PROCEDURE MEANS THAT, CONCEPTUALLY, ALL INDEXING IS DONE AT
SEARCH TIME IN A MODULAR AND DYNAMIC FASHION. DESCRIBES THIS MODULAR APPROACH,
GIVES EXAMPLES, AND SUMMARISES THE ADVANTAGES.
THE TESTING OF RELATIONAL INDEXING PROCEDURES BY DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER PROGRAMS.

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN A RELATIONAL INDEXING SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED BY MEANS
OF A SUITE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH WILL CARRY OUT SEARCHES IN A VARIETY OF
WAYS, WITH, ON DEMAND, DETAILED DIAGNOSTIC FEEDBACK AT ANY STAGE. THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM CAN THUS BE EVALUATED AS A 'SYSTEM' SEPARATELY FROM
USER JUDGEMENTS OF THE OUTPUT. DETAILS OF THE PROGRAMMING ARE DESCRIBED. SOME
INITIAL RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO STRENGTHS AND POSSIBLE
WEAKNESSES OF THE SYSTEM.
ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH
AMERICAN BRANCH, 1-3 JUNE 1980 AT BOULDER, COLORADO.

SPEIAL SECTION DEVOTED TO ABSTRACTS OF 42 PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE 11TH ANNUAL
MEETING OF THE CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY, NORTH AMERICAN BRANCH, BOULDER,
COLORADO, 1-3 JUNE 80, PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH CLUSTERING IN AUTOMATIC

IT HAS GROWN FROM 44 TO 3,000 PAGES. OUTLINES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE NEW
EDITION, ITS ADVANTAGES, THE NUMBER OF RELOCATIONS, PHOENIX SCHEDULES, AND
FUTURE MODIFICATIONS.
CORONADO'S RATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.

FRANCISCO DE PAULA CORONADO (1870-1946) DEVELOPED A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CUBA WHEN HE BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE LIBRARY IN 1920.
BASED ON A SIMPLE EVOLUTIONARY MODEL, CORONADO'S SYSTEM, WHICH HE CALLED
'RATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM', WAS ENTIRELY DERIVATIVE AND NEVER ATTRACTED
MUCH INTEREST.
FINAL REPORT OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY WORKING PARTY ON CLASSIFICATION AND
INDEXING.

REPORT EXAMINES THE SUITABILITY OF THE MAJOR CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR USE
WITHIN THE BRITISH LIBRARY PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO CURRENT USE OF
SCHEMES BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY ITSELF AND OTHER LIBRARIES AND TO BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SERVICES BOTH WITHIN THE UK AND ABROAD. PRECIS AND THE BRITISH MUSEUM SUBJECT
INDEX, THEIR RESPECTIVE COSTS, EASE OF USE, AND POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT ARE ALSO CONSIDERED, PARTICULARLY THE MACHINE-MANIPULATION OF
PRECIS STRINGS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT HEADINGS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE ALREADY USED
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM SUBJECT INDEX. CONCLUDES WITH A SUMMARY OF
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE WORKING PARTY.
SUBJECT HEADINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL WORKS OF ART, ARCHITECTURE AND ANALOGOUS
ARTIFACTS AND STRUCTURES.

IN OCT 78, THE ALA RTSD SUBJECT ANALYSIS COMMITTEE (SAC) APPOINTED A
SUBCOMMITTEE ON SUBJECT HEADINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL WORKS OF ART. DESCRIBES THE
SUBCOMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE, AND PRESENTS PATTERNS AND EXAMPLES
OF SUBJECT HEADINGS FOR ART WORKS AND ANALOGOUS ARTIFACTS, MONUMENTS,
BUILDINGS, GARDENS, BRIDGES, PARKS, AND PLAYGROUNDS, PLAZAS, STREETS AND
MISCELLANEOUS STRUCTURES.
INTRODUCTION TO PRECIS FOR NORTH AMERICAN USAGE.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAVE
RESULTED IN VARIATION IN IDIOMATIC USAGE, WHICH APPEARS IN THE CHOICE OF INDEX
WORDS. PRESENTS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PRESERVED CONTEXT INDEX SYSTEM,
(PRECIS), USING NORTH AMERICAN TERMINOLOGY WHERE NEEDED TO ALLOW PRECIS TO
STAND ON ITS OWN MERITS.
PATENT INFORMATION SYSTEM' A PROCEDURE ADOPTED BY IIP.

DESCRIBES THE USE OF COORDINATE INDEXING AT THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF PETROLEUM
(IIP) TO RETRIEVE INDIAN PATENTS ON SPECIFIC SUBJECTS, THE PATENT NUMBERS
BEING UNKNOWN. THE INSTITUTE INDEXES THE PATENTS USING THE API (AMERICAN
PETROLEUM INSTITUTE) THESAURUS, THE IIP THESAURUS, AND THE INDIAN PATENT
OFFICE CLASSIFICATION NUMBER. THE RESULTANT IN-DEPTH COVERAGE OF THE PATENTS
BRIDGES THE INTER-DISCIPLINE GAP MORE SATISFACTORILY THAN CLASSIFICATION
ALONE.
VIP MANUAL' GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR ERIC VOCABULARY IMPROVEMENT.

THIS MANUAL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE BY ERIC PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE 2 1/2 YEAR
VOCABULARY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (VIP) WHICH CULMINATED IN THE PUBLICATION OF
THE 1980 COMPLETELY REVISED EDITION OF THE THESAURUS OF ERIC DESCRITORS. BASED
ON THE IDEA THAT INDEXING IS NOT ABOUT DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS BUT ABOUT
RETRIEVAL, IT APPLIES CRITERIA DERIVED FROM THE CAPABILITIES OF MANUAL AND
ON-LINE RETRIEVAL TO EXAMPLES OF THESAURAL PROBLEMS. PROJECT PROCEDURES AND
PRINCIPLES FOR VOCABULARY IMPROVEMENT ARE PRESENTED IN THE FIRST 2 SECTIONS,
FOLLOWED BY DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF THE FUNCTIONS AND TREATMENT OF MAIN TERMS,
SCOPE NOTES, AND USE/USE FOR REFERENCES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THESAURUS OF MUSIC CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO MOTIVE, PURPOSE AND CONTENT. A
GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE PROJECT.

THE NEED FOR A DEFINITIVE THESAURUS OF MUSIC HAS BEEN RECOGNISED FOR MANY
YEARS AND VARIOUS STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARDS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE METHOD OF
CATALOGUING MUSICAL CONTENT. THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE (DEUTSCHE
BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (DBI)) HAS BEEN WORKING ON A THESAURUS OF MUSIC SINCE
1978. 1 OF THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES IN THE PREPARATION WAS DECIDING WHICH
CRITERIA WERE NECESSARY FOR INDEXING MUSIC TITLES. WORK STARTED BY COLLECTING
MATERIAL AND EXAMINING EACH TITLE TO SEE WHETHER IT CONTAINED CERTAIN CONCEPTS
WHICH REFERRED TO THE CONTENT. THESE FORMED THE EMPIRIC BASE FOR THE THESAURUS
VOCABULARY. THE THESAURUS WILL CONTAIN 500-600 TERMS WHICH WILL BE THE FUTURE
PREFERRED INDEXING TERMS. THE PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETED BUT IS READY TO BE
TESTED BY THE MUNICIPAL MUSIC LIBRARY IN MUNICH IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR
CATALOGUING ACTIVITY.
INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE FRENCH NATIONAL ARCHIVES.

ACCOUNT OF PROGRESS TO DATE FROM 1972 ON THE PROJECT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO
HOLDINGS BY USING AUTOMATION TO PRODUCE A NEW SERIES OF INDEXES. DETAILS ARE
GIVEN OF THE EARLY MANUAL TREATMENT OF COMPLEX MATERIAL REQUIRING SPECIALIST
ANALYSIS, AND OF LATER LISTINGS PRODUCED BY AUTOMATED TECHNIQUES AFTER
RESEARCH ON NEW METHODS. EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE LISTS ARE GIVEN,
WITH PARTICULAR DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM USED IN MANAGEMENT OF MINISTERIAL
DOCUMENTS.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN REHABILITATION INFORMATION SERVICES.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED. AN
ACCOUNT OF INFORMATION AND REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED IN WESTERN
EUROPE, THE UK, AND INDIA AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICES. DRAWS EXTENSIVELY ON THE
REHABILITATION INTERNATIONAL (RI)/UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL
REHABILITATION (UCIR, AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY) STUDY ON SUCH SERVICES
CONDUCTED BY BARBARA DUNCAN OF RI IN 1979 AND TO BE PUBLISHED AS A DIRECTORY
IN SPRING 81. UCIR AND RI ARE DISCUSSING THE CREATION OF A COMPUTERISED
INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF REHABILITATION IN DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES.
A NAME FOR EVERY CHEMICAL.

DESCRIBES THE CONFUSED STATE OF CHEMICAL NOMENCLATURE AND OUTLINES THE
SOLUTIONS USED BY DATA BANKS. CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE USES RIGID
NOMENCLATURE RULES AND ASSIGNS A UNIQUE 'REGISTRY NUMBER' TO EACH CHEMICAL.
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAVE
ASSEMBLED A GROUP OF DATA BANKS, EACH BASED ON A COLLECTION OF CHEMICALS, INTO
THE INTEGRATED CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH MAY BE SEARCHED BY REGISTRY
NUMBER, SYSTEMATIC NAMES, SOME TRIVIAL NAMES, AND STRUCTURES 'DRAWN' BY THE
USER AT THE TERMINAL. SOME DATA BANKS AND MANY RESEARCH-BASED ORGANISATIONS
USE THE WISWESSER LINE NOTATION, AN ALPHANUMERIC LINEAR NOTATION.
DESIGN STUDY FOR AN ANOMALOUS STATE OF KNOWLEDGE BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM.

THE LONG TERM AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IN WHICH
NO EXPLICIT QUERY FORMULATION WILL BE NECESSARY, THE SYSTEM INSTEAD
CONSTRUCTING A PICTURE OF THE USER'S INFORMATION NEED, AND CHOOSING A
RETRIEVAL STRATEGY APPROPRIATE TO THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF NEED. THE AUTHORS
REPORT ON A PRELIMINARY STUDY IN WHICH THEY ANALYSED UNSTRUCTURED PROBLEM
STATEMENTS OBTAINED BY INTERVIEWING A NUMBER OF USERS, USED SIMILAR ANALYSIS
TECHNIQUES TO REPRESENT DOCUMENT ABSTRACTS, AND DEVELOPED A CLASSIFICATION
SCHEME FOR PROBLEM STATEMENTS.
GROWING DEMAND FOR ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.

THE RECENTLY-EMERGED ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO CONTROL
THE INFORMATION EXPLOSION TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN PREVIOUS INFORMATION
SYSTEMS AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST MEDIA FOR FAST ACCURATE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT, COST, POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS,
AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS; HIGHLIGHTS SOME SIGNIFICANT
ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE LAST 10 YEARS; AND EMPHASISES THE NEED FOR MUCH
FURTHER RESEARCH TO INCREASE THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND
UTILITY OF SUCH SYSTEMS. DISCUSSES SOME PROBLEMS WHICH ARE HINDERING THE
IMMEDIATE ADOPTION OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS IN INDIA.
ONLINE SERVICES' SOME OBSERVATIONS.

REVIEW OF THE LAST 10 YEARS OF ON-LINE SERVICES, BASED MAINLY ON A LECTURE
GIVEN BY CARLOS CUADRA AT THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL ONLINE INFORMATION MEETING,
LONDON, 9-11 DEC 80. TODAY THERE ARE 19 PROCESSORS, 600 ON-LINE PUBLIC
INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES, AND 15,000 USER ORGANISATIONS. LOOKS FORWARD TO THE
NEXT DECADE, UNDER 3 HEADINGS' ON-LINE SERVICES; DATA BASE PRODUCERS; AND
USERS OF ON-LINE SERVICES.
LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND BLAISE.

DISCUSSES THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, CATALOGUING, AND OTHER LIBRARY RELATED
SERVICES OFFERED BY BLAISE-THE UMBRELLA NAME FOR ALL THE AUTOMATED SERVICES OF
THE BRITISH LIBRARY BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES DIVISION. GIVES BRIEF DETAILS OF'
THE VARIOUS DATABASES HELD ON THE BLAISE CENTRAL COMPUTER; THE INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES OF ELHILL-THE SOFTWARE USED; AND THE OPERATION OF

ACTIVITIES CAN BE CONDUCTED EITHER INHOUSE ON LIBRARY PREMISES, OR THROUGH A
CENTRALISED SERVICE.
A FEW PRACTICAL REMARKS ON THE USER-FRIENDLINESS OF ONLINE SYSTEMS.

A LIST OF GENERAL PROPERTIES OF A USER-FRIENDLY ON-LINE SYSTEM IS PRESENTED.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE REQUIREMENTS OF EXPERIENCED USERS ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF
THE BEGINNERS OR INCIDENTAL USERS ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE CONTRADICTORY.
SYNONYMOUS COMMANDS, LESS STRICTLY FORMALISED INPUT DATA TRANSFORMED TO
STANDARDISED FORMATS BY INTELLIGENT INPUT PROGRAMS, EXPLICIT AS WELL AS
IMPLICIT INPUT DATA, FREE CHOICE BETWEEN DEFAULT OR USER'S OWN PARAMETERS AND
PROCEDURES OR MACROCOMMANDS, CAN MAKE ANY SYSTEM MORE FRIENDLY EVEN FOR
HETEROGENEOUS USER POPULATION.
EXPERIENCES OF DESIGNING A DATA BASE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS INFORMATION USING AN
ENGLISH LANGUAGE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED USING A MANUAL SYSTEM TO MANAGE DATA GENERATED BY
CLINICAL TRIALS AT SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH, ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR HANDLING CLINICAL TRIALS' DATA, USING DATA BASE
TECHNIQUES, IS PRESENTED. THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THE BENEFITS GAINED
FROM USING BOTH HIERARCHICAL TREE AND NETWORK STRUCTURES ARE DISCUSSED. THE
DISCIPLINES ENFORCED BY A COMPUTER SYSTEM NECESSITATED SOME CHANGES IN THE
DESIGN OF THE DOCUMENTS USED TO RECORD THE RAW DATA. THESE CHANGES ARE
DESCRIBED. ABOUT HALF OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS' DATA ARE QUALITATIVE OR TEXTUAL,
AND THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN COMPUTERISING THIS TYPE OF DATA AND THEIR
SOLUTIONS ARE PRESENTED.

BRIEF ARTICLE DERIVED FROM A PAPER PRESENTED BY DR. P.L. HOLMES, AT THE 4TH
INTERNATIONAL ONLINE INFORMATION MEETING, LONDON, 9-11 DEC 80 (SEE 81/4689).
PRECISION SEARCHING WITH THE CONDOR INFORMATION SYSTEM.

CONDOR (COMMUNICATION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE WITH DIALOGUE ORIENTED RETRIEVAL
SYSTEMS) DEVELOPED BY SIEMENS SINCE 1972, IS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR
PROCESSING STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED INFORMATION. ITS PRECISION SEARCH
SYSTEM MAKES POSSIBLE A SEARCH FOR TERMS AND ALSO FOR TERMINOLOGICAL
CONNECTIONS WITHIN A TEXT. DESCRIPTIONS ARE INCLUDED OF' PRECISION SEARCHING
COMPONENTS, SUCH AS LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS; FORMATION OF ANALYSIS RESULTS INTO
G-NETWORKS; DISCOVERY OF RELEVANT TEXTUAL POINTS ASSISTED BY 4 RELEVANCE
FUNCTIONS; AND RETRIEVAL DIALOGUE. ALL COMPONENTS ARE BEING TESTED IN THE
CONTEXT OF AN OFFICE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND A SYSTEM ON WORK SAFETY; THE
SYSTEM WILL BEGIN OPERATING DURING THE 1980S.
PERSONAL REFERENCE COLLECTIONS AND ONLINE SEARCHING.

A MASSIVE NUMBER OF PERSONAL COLLECTIONS OF PAPERS AND REPORTS EXIST IN
MEDICINE AND A WIDE NUMBER OF OTHER SUBJECT AREAS. THE USEFULNESS OF THESE
COLLECTIONS COULD BE IMPROVED BY PROVIDING A LINK WITH THE LARGE ON-LINE
COLLECTIONS, INFORMING THE USER WHICH RETRIEVED REFERENCES WERE HELD IN HIS
OWN COLLECTION. THIS LINK COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH EXTRA LOCAL PROCESSING ON THE
SEARCH TERMINAL RESULTING IN IMPROVED CONFIDENCE IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS AND
INCREASED UTILISATION OF BOTH REMOTE AND PERSONAL COLLECTIONS.

INFORMATION SYSTEM DYNAMICS' MODELLING THE IMPACT OF ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SERVICES.

A FAMILY OF MODELS, DEVELOPED DURING A 1-YEAR STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION SERVICES ON UK LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, IS USED TO
INTRODUCE INFORMATION SYSTEM DYNAMICS; A COMPUTER-BASED SIMULATION TECHNIQUE
FOR EXPLORING THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES OF COMPLEX SOCIAL SYSTEMS. MODELLING
INFORMATION SYSTEM DYNAMICS SHOULD IMPROVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PLANNERS,
LIBRARIANS, INFORMATION PRODUCERS AND USERS AND HENCE RESULT IN MORE EFFECTIVE
INFORMATION SERVICES.
COMMUNICATION TODAY AND TOMORROW; (ELECTRONICS IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE '90'S).

THE HISTORY OF LIBRARY INFORMATION PROVISION HAS UNDERGONE 4 PHASES' (1) STOCK
FORMATION; (2) AUTOMATION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROCESSES; (3)
INFORMATION FLOW AND INTENSIVE STOCK GROWTH; (4) DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATION. THE COMBINATION OF ELECTRONIC TELETYPE WITH VIDEO TERMINALS
FACILITATED INFORMATION TRANSMISSION. THE TELEFAX EQUIPMENT TRANSMITS A
FACSIMILE OF THE INFORMATION ALONG A TELEPHONE NETWORK. THE 'ELECTRONIC POST'
TRANSMITS COMMUNICATIONS FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER. SYSTEMS HAVE EVOLVED FOR
TRANSMITTING INFORMATION ONTO DOMESTIC TV SCREENS. UTILISATION OF TV CHANNELS
FACILITATED THE CREATION OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS PROVIDING INFORMATION TO A WIDE
CIRCLE OF CONSUMERS. CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV SYSTEMS PERMIT LIBRARIES TO DISSEMINATE
INFORMATION SELECTIVELY. RECENTLY VIDEORECORDINGS, USING HIGH INFORMATION
CAPACITY DISK VIDEOPLAYERS, HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO LIBRARIES.
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY: IMPROVING ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR DISABLED PERSONS.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
OUTLINES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HANDICAPPED OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS VIDEOTEXT AND THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF LARGE
ELECTRONIC NETWORKS. THEIR POTENTIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED IS EXCITING, BUT SOME
PEOPLE FEAR THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONIC
SYSTEMS FOR USE IN THE HOME WILL FURTHER ISOLATE THE SEVERELY DISABLED RATHER
THAN INTEGRATE THEM INTO SOCIETY.
OVERVIEW OF THE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES INFORMATION NETWORK.

INTRODUCES THE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES INFORMATION NETWORK (CSIN), A COORDINATED
NETWORK OF ON-LINE CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF CSIN,
THE BENEFITS OF ITS USE, AND ITS TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.
PRESTEL: GATEWAY TO AN ELECTRONIC EXPLOSION.

THE INITIAL UK VIEWDATA CONCEPT WAS OF A SYSTEM OF POWERFUL COMPUTERS, EACH
HOLDING ALL THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY 'INFORMATION PROVIDERS'. THE WEST
GERMANS ENHANCED THIS CONCEPT BY CONNECTING THEIR CENTRAL BILDSCHIRMTEXT
(VIEWDATA) COMPUTERS TO 'THIRD PARTY' (I.E. OTHER PEOPLE'S) DATA BASES. THE
DRAMATIC RESULTS HAVE MADE THE UK ADD THE GERMAN MODIFICATIONS TO PRESTEL AND
THE NEW SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LONDON IN EARLY 1982. DESCRIBES THE
DEMONSTRATION OF THIS 'GATEWAY' CONCEPT AT 2 RECENT UK CONFERENCES, THE
RESPONSE, IMPLICATIONS, POSSIBLE FURTHER USES OF GATEWAYS, AND THE GREATER USE
OF VIEWDATA IN WEST GERMANY THAN IN THE UK.
WILL VIEWDATA SYSTEMS BE USED IN EDUCATION?.

AN INTRODUCTION TO VIEWDATA SYSTEMS IS PROVIDED AS A BASIS FOR STUDYING THEIR
POTENTIAL FOR EDUCATIONAL USE. THE BBC ARE ALREADY CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS TO
USE CEEFAX IN EDUCATION AND COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO FALL AS APPLICATION BECOMES
MORE WIDESPREAD. VIEWDATA SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE VERSATILE AND WILL
PROBABLY BE USED MOST IN SPECIALISED EDUCATION RATHER THAN THE MORE GENERAL
FIELD. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE MICROPROCESSOR-CONTROLLED TERMINALS
CONNECTED IN CLUSTERS OVER A SINGLE TELEPHONE LINE, IMPROVED GRAPHICS
FACILITIES, AND THE LINKING OF SMALL IN-HOUSE SYSTEMS TO THE NATIONAL PRESTEL
NETWORK AS MORE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACQUIRE THEIR OWN COMPUTERS.
HOME VIDEOTEX SERVICES' SOME LEGAL ISSUES.

REVISED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE, NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN
CANADIAN COMMUNICATIONS LAW AND POLICY, OTTAWA, JAN 80. THE PROVISION OF
VIDEOTEX SERVICES RAISES INTERESTING LEGAL ISSUES. THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF
REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO RADIO, TELEVISION, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL
LIKELY APPLY TO VIDEOTEX, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS MAY WELL
BE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA
COVERS INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTERS SUCH AS THAT WHICH WOULD BE CONTAINED
IN A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM. VIDEOTEX SERVICES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE CANADA WOULD BE
ABLE TO SIDESTEP CANADIAN PRIORITIES AND CANADIAN LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS. IT
HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT A WAY OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM WOULD BE TO REGULATE
THE FLOW OF DATA ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS.
THE UK'S PRESTEL ADOPTED AS INTERNATIONAL STANDARD.

CCITT STUDY GROUPS HAVE ADOPTED THE BRITISH PRESTEL AS A RECOMMENDED
INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR VIEWDATA SYSTEMS. THE FRENCH SYSTEM, TELETEL, HAS
ALSO BEEN RECOGNISED AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. STANDARDISATION WORK HAS
INVOLVED 2 STUDY GROUPS, 1 DEALING WITH THE SERVICE ASPECTS AND THE OTHER
COVERING TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATING TO VIEWDATA. INCLUDED ARE DETAILS OF THIS
STANDARDISATION WORK AND A NOTE OF THE 4 KINDS OF VIEWDATA SYSTEM RECOGNISED
BY THE STUDY GROUPS.
MOVE OVER ELECTRONIC MAIL HERE COMES VIEWDATA.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRESTEL IS TRACED. DETAILS OF THE PRESTEL SERVICE,
INFORMATION PROVIDERS, COSTS, AND SOME PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED. AT PRESENT, THE
LARGEST OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDERS IS FINTEL WHICH PROVIDES ANALYSES OF
INDUSTRY AND FINANCE, ETC. RIVAL VIEWDATA SYSTEMS, DEVELOPMENT BY FRANCE,
CANADA, AND SWEDEN, ARE AMONG OTHER TOPICS EXAMINED.
NEW MEDIA-NEW OPPORTUNITIES?.

THE OUTLOOK FOR NEW ELECTRONIC MEDIA IN AUSTRIA IS DISCUSSED. THE LEGAL
CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE NEW MEDIA ARE CONSIDERED AND THE PROSPECTS FOR
TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA ARE ASSESSED. THE PILOT VIEWDATA PROJECT BEING CARRIED
OUT IN AUSTRIA IS EXAMINED AND SOME COMMENTS ARE MADE ON SATELLITE TV.
VIEWDATA DP INTEGRATION.

4 PAPERS ARE PRESENTED. A. CHANDOR GIVES AN INTERNATIONAL OVERVIEW OF VIEWDATA
AND DATA PROCESSING. A.R. HAIMES DISCUSSES IN-HOUSE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS WITH
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TERMINALS, APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS. B.R. ASHDOWN

AND BENEFITS OF DOING SO. W. HUGHES EXPLAINS THE PRESTEL INTERNATIONAL MARKET
TRIAL AND DISCUSSES THE FUTURE FOR PRESTEL INTERNATIONAL.
DESIGN OF DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FOR VIEWDATA.

USE OF VIEWDATA SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY PRIVATE SYSTEMS, IS CONSIDERED. A BRIEF
INTRODUCTION TO INTERACTIVE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS IS GIVEN WITH SOME DEFINITIONS OF
TERMS. THE ATTRACTIONS FOR COMPANIES OF THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM ARE OUTLINED,
FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF EQUIPMENT WHICH IS USED EITHER FOR ACCESSING
PUBLIC SYSTEMS OR FOR PRIVATE SYSTEMS. SOME COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN UK AND
DUTCH SYSTEMS, AND TECHNIQUES OF DATA COMMUNICATION ARE DISCUSSED.
VIEWDATA MOVES IN.

VARIOUS COMPANY TRIALS WITH PRIVATE VIEWDATA AS A MEDIUM FOR IN-HOUSE
INFORMATION SERVICES ARE EXAMINED. IT IS FOUND THAT SUCH SYSTEMS OFFER A CHEAP
SOLUTION TO COMPANY INFORMATION PROBLEMS. IT IS FELT THAT PRIVATE VIEWDATA
SYSTEMS WILL BE USEFUL IN THE MAJOR AREAS OF INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, DATA
COLLECTION AND ELECTRONIC MAIL.
SETTING OTHERS A LESSON AT PILKINGTON.

PIONEER WORK WITH PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEMS CARRIED OUT AT PILKINGTON BROTHERS
THE LEADING FLAT GLASS MANUFACTURER IS DISCUSSED. THE POTENTIAL OF VIEWDATA,
THE CHOICE OF A SYSTEM, ITS DESIGN AND THE USES TO WHICH IT IS PUT ARE
DESCRIBED. ITS APPLICATIONS FOR A WAREHOUSE IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM TRANSMITTING
DATA ON DESIGN PROBLEMS AROUND THE WORLD, FOR A CONTROL SYSTEM FOR ROLLER
USAGE IN THE GLASS FACTORIES AND FOR MARKETING INFORMATION IS EXPLAINED. THE
FUTURE OF THE PRIVATE VIEWDATA SYSTEM AND OTHER RELATED TECHNOLOGIES IN THE
COMPANY ARE CONSIDERED.
VIEWDATA IN ACTION' A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PRESTEL.

COLLECTED PAPERS ON VIEWDATA, AND PARTICULARLY PRESTEL, REVIEWING THE
TECHNICAL, EDITORIAL, AND PICTORIAL ASPECTS OF THE MEDIUM. AN INTERNATIONAL
SECTION PROVIDES A COMPARISON OF VIEWDATA DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USA, CANADA,
JAPAN, WEST GERMANY, FINLAND AND FRANCE.
PRESTEL' REDISCOVERING YOUR TELEVISION.

THIS BASIC GUIDE TO VIEWDATA TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRESTEL. NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL MARKETING EFFORTS ARE DISCUSSED AND DEFINITIONS OF IMPORTANT
TERMS, LIKE VIDEOTEX, TELETEXT AND TELEX, ARE PROVIDED. BUSINESS APPLICATIONS,
THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE INFORMATION PROVIDERS, AND PRESTEL CHARGES ARE AMONG
OTHER ASPECTS EXAMINED.
PRESTEL TO TRANSMIT COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS.

BRITISH TELECOM, PART OF THE POST OFFICE, HAS DEMONSTRATED PROTOTYPE PICTURE
PRESTEL CAPABLE OF DISPLAYING FULL-COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS, ACCOMPANIED BY TEXT.
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO POTENTIAL OVERSEAS PURCHASERS OF
PRESTEL AND TO COMPANIES WHO WISH TO OFFER PRIVATE VIEWDATA SERVICES. THE LATE
1980S IS PROBABLY THE EARLIEST DATE FOR THE WIDESPREAD INTRODUCTION OF PICTURE
PRESTEL. DETAILS OF DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED.
ON THE INTRODUCTION OF VIEWDATA IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION.
PART 1.

'BILDSCHIRMTEXT' (BTX) IS A VIEWDATA SYSTEM SIMILAR TO PRESTEL WHICH IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN WEST GERMANY BY THE FEDERAL POST OFFICE. BTX REGISTERED USERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A
DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE
NECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A
TYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE
SYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
INFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.
FACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE
PROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL
PROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS
IMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND
T ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THIS NEW
SERVICE WITHOUT DUPLICATING EXISTING INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES.
VIDEOTEX RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT' THE CANADIAN CONTEXT AND CONTRIBUTION.

IDENTIFIES PRESENT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN VIDEOTEX SERVICES, INCLUDING
RESEARCH CONCERNED WITH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, ACCESS TO INFORMATION, SOCIAL
AND BEHAVIOURAL IMPLICATIONS, AND METHODOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS. THE
CANADIAN TELIDON VIDEOTEX SYSTEM IS GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS A HIGH-QUALITY
ALTERNATIVE TO THE UK SERIAL ALPHA-MOSAIC AND FRENCH PARALLEL ALPHA-MOSAIC
CODING SYSTEMS. INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF TELIDON HAVE
CREATED A QUITE DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION MEDIUM. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT (BASED UPON A COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL INDEPENDENT OF DISPLAY,
CARRIER, AND CONTENT AND CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO A VARIABLE SCALE
COST/QUALITY CONTINUUM) PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT SIGNIFICANT TO
BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY.
THE USE OF PRESTEL IN A SOLICITORS' LAW FIRM IN THE CITY.

IN DEC 78, NORTON, ROSE, BOTTERELL & ROCHE, A FIRM OF LONDON SOLICITORS, WERE
PROVIDED WITH A SPONSORED PRESTEL SET BY FINTEL, AND THEY HAVE MAINTAINED THE
SET SINCE THE SPONSORSHIP PERIOD ENDED. PRESTEL PROVIDES WIDE COVERAGE OF
INFORMATION FOR THE BUSINESS TRAVELLER, AND A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION AIMED
AT THE DOMESTIC MARKET. HOWEVER, THERE ARE 6 INFORMATION PROVIDERS OF INTEREST
TO LAWYERS. DESCRIBES THE SERVICES PROVIDED, THE USE MADE OF PRESTEL, AND THE
BENEFITS OF THE SERVICE.
VIEWDATA DEAF-AID.

THIS BRIEF REVIEW DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT SET UP BY THE ROYAL NATIONAL
INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF, BRITISH TELECOM AND THE NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION (NRDC). THE EXPERIMENT INVOLVES 25 DEAF PEOPLE WITH A GOOD COMMAND
OF SPEECH AND EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES OF HOLDING TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS
WITH HEARING FRIENDS VIA A 'VOICE BUREAU'. NRDC EQUIPMENT, CALLED PALANTYPE,
IS USED AND THIS ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO TYPE OUT THE SPOKEN WORD ONTO A
PRESTEL-TYPE TV SCREEN, THUS ENABLING THE DEAF PERSON TO SEE THE
'CONVERSATION'. EVEN IF TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, HOWEVER, A GENERAL SERVICE WILL
ONLY BE ENVISAGED IF HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS CAN BE OVERCOME.
VIEWDATA SYSTEMS' DESIGNING A DATABASE FOR EFFECTIVE USER ACCESS.

VIEWDATA SYSTEMS, STILL IN THEIR INFANCY, HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR
REVOLUTIONISING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. REALISATION OF THIS POTENTIAL REQUIRES
A USER-ORIENTED SYSTEM, BASED ON SOUND PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL,
WITH MAXIMUM USE OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY. EXAMINES USER REQUIREMENTS IN
ACCESSING VIEWDATA SYSTEMS, DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS AND PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN
PROVIDING EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO PRESENT SYSTEMS, AND CONSIDERS FUTURE DIRECTIONS
IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT.
PRESTEL' FLAWS IN THE INDEXING TREE.

POSSIBILITIES OF THE SERVICE. THE MARKETING IMPLICATIONS OF VIEWDATA ARE
DISCUSSED AND THE SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES FOR THE RETAILER ARE
CONSIDERED.
CBS STEPPING OUT FOR FRENCH TELETEXT.

IMPATIENT WITH THE DELAYS CREATED BY THE ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION'S
SUBCOMMITTEE ON TELETEXT, CBS INC. HAS ENDORSED THE FRENCH-DEVELOPED ANTIOPE
TELETEXT SYSTEM AS A US STANDARD. THE MAIN REASONS WHY IT WAS PREFERRED OVER
COMPETING SYSTEMS (INCLUDING THE UK CEEFAX AND ORACLE) IS ITS CAPACITY FOR
ACCOMMODATING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS A SOFTWARE SYSTEM
WITH ITS DATA STREAM FORMULATED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE TRANSMISSION MODE.
COMMUNICATION WITH AN OCLC MODEL 100 TERMINAL.

THE OCLC MODEL 100 COMPUTER TERMINAL WAS DESIGNED ORIGINALLY TO BE USED IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE OCLC (ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY CENTER) ON-LINE CATALOGUING

A COMPARISON OF OVERLAP: ERIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS.

IN NOV 78, THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA EDUCATION LIBRARY INVESTIGATED THE
OVERLAP OF THE ERIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS ON-LINE DATA BASES, PERFORMING
THE SAME 4 SEARCHES ON BOTH. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS AND SUGGESTS THAT WHEN
BUDGET RESTRICTIONS FORCE A CHOICE TO BE MADE BETWEEN THE 2, THE SEARCHER
SHOULD' CONSIDER THE END USER'S DISCIPLINE-EDUCATION OR PSYCHOLOGY; USE ERIC
FOR TOPICS DEALING WITH THE 'NORMAL' POPULATION, PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, AND
APPLIED SETTINGS; USE PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS FOR MATERIAL ON 'ABNORMAL' OR
'DISTURBED' POPULATIONS, CLINICAL SETTINGS, AND NON-US TOPICS; REMEMBER THAT
ERIC IS EASIER TO SEARCH MANUALLY THAN THE OTHER; AND CONSIDER THEIR
NON-JOURNAL COVERAGE.
ECER ON BRS.

THE COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN'S EXCEPTIONAL CHILD EDUCATION RESOURCES
(ECER) DATA BASE COMPRISES 35,000 CITATIONS ON THE EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED OR

A MEDLINE FEASIBILITY STUDY.

A MEDLINE FEASIBILITY STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE NORTHEASTERN CONSORTIUM FOR
HEALTH INFORMATION (NECHI) AND SPONSORED BY THE NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL MEDICAL
LIBRARY SERVICE. IT IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT MOST POTENTIAL USERS AND
SUPPORTERS OF MEDLINE WITHIN HOSPITALS ARE UNAWARE OF ITS USEFULNESS AND
APPLICATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE NECHI WITH AN EVALUATION
OF MEDLINE AS A FEASIBLE SERVICE BY ASCERTAINING THE NEED AND BY EVALUATING
THE USEFULNESS, SATISFACTION, AND COSTS OF THE SYSTEM. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED
SUFFICIENT USE OF MEDLINE TO JUSTIFY IMPLEMENTATION WITHIN NECHI AND IT
PROVIDED USEFUL DATA TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF MEDLINE IN EACH INSTITUTION.
EXPERIENCES IN THE INTRODUCTION OF ON-LINE SERVICES IN INDUSTRY.

ON-LINE SERVICES HAVE BEEN OFFERED ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS IN WEST GERMANY SINCE
1975, BUT ARE STILL NOT WIDELY USED. AN EXAMPLE OF AN ON-LINE SERVICE USED IN
INDUSTRY IS DOKUMENTATION MASCHINENBAU (DOMA). THIS SERVICE HAS 17 USERS IN
INDUSTRY, MAINLY IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BRANCHES BUT ALSO IN ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL AND CONSUMER GOODS CONCERNS. THE USERS ARE GENERALLY
CONFINED TO LARGE SCALE BUSINESSES EMPLOYING BETWEEN 1,000-25,000 PEOPLE. TO
MAKE EFFICIENT USE OF THE DOMA SERVICE IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE BEEN RUNNING A
SUCCESSFUL DOCUMENTATION DEPARTMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, TO USE THE ON-LINE
SERVICE TO IMPLEMENT THE EXISTING INFORMATION ACTIVITY AND TO HAVE STAFF WHO
ARE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ON-LINE SERVICES. DOMA
PROVIDES PERSONNEL TRAINING AND HELPS WITH INSTALLATION OF HARDWARE BESIDES
PROVIDING ADVICE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD. THIS ASPECT OF ON-LINE SERVICES IS
VITAL AND TO UNDEREST IMATE LEADS TO UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS.
THE USE OF ONLINE SEARCHING IN THE FIELD OF PRODUCTION STUDIES.

DISCUSSES THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE CRANFIELD INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (UK)
SCHOOL OF PRODUCTION STUDIES; ITS USE OF ON-LINE DATA BASES; AND ON-LINE
SEARCH TECHNIQUES. PRESENTS THE TEXT AND RESULTS OF 3 ON-LINE SEARCHES AND
EXPLAINS HOW THE DATA BASES USED WERE CHOSEN. BECAUSE PRODUCTION STUDIES
CROSSES THE BOUNDARIES OF SEVERAL SUBJECTS, A VARIETY OF DATA BASES ARE OFTEN
USED IN A SEARCH. THE MOST-USED ARE COMPENDEX AND NTIS, FOLLOWED BY ISMEC AND
INSPEC.
ON-LINE SEARCH EXPERIENCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TEXTURE OF ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS.

THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE METALLGESELLSCHAFT AG (METAL
ASSOCIATION COMPANY), FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN, NOTED THAT MANY ON-LINE SEARCHERS
REQUIRED INFORMATION FROM 2 OR MORE DATA BASES SINCE THE INFORMATION OVERLAP
BETWEEN DIFFERENT BASES IS NARROW. AN INVESTIGATION WAS MADE CONCERNING SEARCH
TERM FREQUENCIES IN MATERIAL ON ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS AND CONCERNING THE
INFORMATION POTENTIAL OF VARIOUS DATA BASES BETWEEN 1972-78 AND 1964-71;
RESULTS ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF DATA PROCESSING MUST BE
WATCHED; MORE SIMPLIFICATION, UNITY AND ACCURACY ARE NEEDED. THE MANY NATIONAL
DATA STORES ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE AMALGAMATED INTO 1
WELL-ORGANISED DATA BANK, SINCE MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE
MULTIDISCIPLINARY.
ART MODERN/DIALOG.

ART MODERN IS AN ON-LINE DATA BASE, AVAILABLE THROUGH LOCKHEED DIALOG SINCE

COVERAGE, AND INDEXING CHARACTERISTICS; OFFERS SOME SEARCH HINTS; AND PROVIDES
(WITH COMMENTS) THE TEXTS OF 9 ON-LINE SEARCHES.
AUTO-INDEXING OF THE 1971-77 ABI/INFORM DATABASE.

EXPLAINS WHY IT WAS DECIDED NOT TO INDEX ABI/INFORM WHEN IT BEGAN IN 1971 AND
WHY THIS DECISION WAS REVERSED IN 1977. INDEX TERMS WERE AUTOMATICALLY
ASSIGNED TO THE 65,000 ABSTRACTS IN THE ON-LINE DATA BASE ON 31 DEC 77 AND
CONTROLLED VOCABULARY AND INDEX TERM ASSIGNMENT WERE INTRODUCED FOR ALL
ENTRIES FROM THE JAN 78 UPDATE ONWARDS. THE INDEXED DATA BASE BECAME AVAILABLE
IN LATE SPRING 78. DESCRIBES THE AUTOMATIC INDEXING PROCEDURE; GIVES EXAMPLES
OF RESULTANT FALSE DROPS IN SEARCHES; LISTS THE ADVANTAGES OF INTRODUCING
INDEXING; AND OUTLINES POSSIBLE FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DATA BASE.
SEMANTIC LIMITATION IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.

THE BASIC PROBLEM IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE IS NOT
PROPERLY ADAPTED TO THAT OF THE AUTHOR. MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION, WHERE
WORDS WITH THE SAME ROOT ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE INVERTED FILE, IS A GOOD
ELIMINATOR OF NOISE AND INFORMATION LOSS, PROVIDING HIGH RECALL BUT LOW
PRECISION. PRECISION CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED, WHEREBY
SEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM THE MORPHOLOGICAL PERIPHERY OF THE ROOTS CAN BE
OBTAINED, WHICH CAN BE VERY RELEVANT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE PROCESS
INVOLVES RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DERIVATIVE SUFFIXES, PREFIXES AND COMPOSITE
TERMS, PLUS THE USE OF LINK OPERATORS; VARIOUS FORMULATION POSSIBILITIES ARE
ILLUSTRATED. AUTOMATIC INCLUSION OF AUTONOMOUS WORD STRUCTURES IS ALLOWED.

HISTORY AND STATE OF THE ART OF THE JAMAICAN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY PUBLISHED
BY, AND AS A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE ACCESSIONS OF, THE WEST INDIA REFERENCE
LIBRARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF JAMAICA. THE BIBLIOGRAPHY WAS ORIGINALLY NAMED

BIBLIOGRAPHIES COVERING THE ANTIFASCIST RESISTANCE MOVEMENT DURING WORLD WAR
II AND THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING IN 1944. DURING THE YEARS 1979-80, THE
TOTAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC OUTPUT IN THIS FIELD WAS 6,400 COPIES OF 39 HEADINGS, WITH
A TOTAL OF 4,311 PAGES AND 11,142 ANNOTATIONS. THE NEXT MAJOR TASK CONFRONTING
THE LIBRARY STAFF IS THE COMPILATION OF A CRITICAL COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY

THE EVOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND PUBLISHING IN AMERICA.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING REFORM. GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND PUBLISHING STARTED AS A
CONGRESSIONAL FUNCTION AND ONLY GRADUALLY EVOLVED INTO AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH
ACTIVITY. POLICY DECISIONS REGARDING PRINTING ARE STILL MADE BY CONGRESS. THE
EVOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING FROM THE USE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLICATION
FACILITIES, TO FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE),
AND FINALLY TO A COMBINATION OF OFFICIAL AGENCIES AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS, HAS
OFTEN BEEN UNEASY.
AMERICAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND PUBLICATION REFORM.

A SPECIAL ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT US GOVERNMENT PRINTING
REFORM ACTIVITIES. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE 4 ARTICLES, SEE THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'-.
GOVERNMENT PRINTING REFORM' AN INDEPENDENT MANAGERIAL PERSPECTIVE.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING REFORM. THERE IS NO MANAGERIAL PRECEPT TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT
ANOMALY OF CONGRESSIONAL OPERATION AND CONTROL OF FEDERAL PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING MATTERS OTHER THAN FOR THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY CONGRESS. THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRINTING REFORM
LEGISLATION PROMISE TO PERPETUATE THE BUREAUCRATIC INEFFICIENCES, SQUABBLING,
RED TAPE, AND SUBTERFUGES PREVALENT IN THE PRINTING AND PUBLISHING POLICY
SYSTEM. REMEDIES WHICH SHOULD BE PURSUED INCLUDE REMOVING CONGRESSIONAL
INTRUSION IN THESE MATTERS AND ESTABLISHING CENTRAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
RECODIFYING TITLE 44, UNITED STATES CODE' THE NATIONAL PUBLICATIONS ACT OF
1980.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE DEVOTED TO US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINTING AND
PUBLISHING REFORM. THE US GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE HAS ELUDED FOR A NUMBER
OF YEARS ATTEMPTS TO INSTALL MODERN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES FOR THE PRINTING,
BINDING, AND DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. IN 1978 A
CONCERTED EFFORT AT PRINTING REFORM WAS INITIATED IN CONGRESS, RESULTING IN
THE NATIONAL PUBLICATIONS ACT OF 1980. PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE GENERAL
CONDITIONS WHICH PROMPTED THE REFORM LEGISLATION, ITS PREPARATION, AND THE
SUBSTANCE OF ITS PROVISIONS.
A PROBLEM SITUATION AND WAYS OF OVERCOMING IT.

AT PRESENT 97% OF SOVIET FAMILIES POSSESS HOME LIBRARIES, AND 70% OF THE
POPULATION READS FOR 1 HOUR DAILY. CONSEQUENTLY TRADITIONAL EDITIONS OF
200,000 TO 500,000 COPIES FAIL TO SATISFY DEMAND. INTERLIBRARY LOANS AND
PROVIDING LIBRARIES WITH SUPPLEMENTARY COPIES OF POPULAR BOOKS COULD FURNISH
BETTER SATISFACTION. BOOKSELLERS, LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY-USERS SHOULD HELP TO
DETERMINE SIZE OF EDITIONS. THE MEDIA, READERS AND LIBRARIANS SHOULD PERSUADE
THE PUBLIC THAT READING BOOKS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN COLLECTING THEM.
INFORMATION USED ONCE ONLY COULD APPEAR IN 'TELEJOURNALS'. SOME PUBLISHERS
SHOULD PRODUCE MULTI-MILLION, MODERATELY PRICED EDITIONS OF CLASSIC AND MODERN
LITERATURE FOR HOME USE, WHILE OTHERS PROVIDED LARGE STOUTLY-BOUND EDITIONS
FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. BOOKSELLERS, PUBLISHERS, LIBRARIANS AND READERS SHOULD
JOIN TO DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS.
MICROFORM ADVERTISING.

SUMMARISES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ALA RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES
MICROPUBLISHING COMMITTEE AD HOC SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE MONITORING OF MICROFORM
ADVERTISING. FROM JAN 77, MEMBERS COMPARED THE ADVERTISING OF 84 US

DERIVED FROM THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE ADVERTISING OF
MICROPUBLICATIONS. RESPONSES, RECEIVED FROM 64% OF THE COMPANIES EVALUATED
EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S EFFORT. DRAFT SAMPLE MICROFORM
REPLACEMENT GUIDELINES WERE CIRCULATED TO 10 MICROPUBLISHERS FOR COMMENT, AND
A FOLLOW-UP STUDY IS TO BE CONDUCTED IN 1982.
FINAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON NEW TECHNOLOGICAL USES OF
COPYRIGHTED WORKS, JULY 31, 1978.

RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE 3 YEARS OF DATA COLLECTION, HEARING, ANALYSIS AND
DELIBERATION CALLED FOR IN THE COMMISSION'S ENABLING LEGISLATION.
FEATURE ON CENSORSHIP).2

-PART FEATURE ON CENSORSHIP. PART 1' THE MANY FACES OF CENSORSHIP, EXPLORES
THE ISSUES WHICH TRIGGER OFF THE DESIRE FOR CENSORSHIP, SUCH AS THE TENSION

ORGANISATIONS. STRESSES THE VALUE OF INFORMATION IN THE PUBLICATIONS OF
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE UNO AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN
UNITY, AND ADVOCATES THAT GREATER PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE EXPLOITATION
OF THIS LITERATURE. A CHANGED ATTITUDE IS NECESSARY TO GIVE INTERNATIONAL
LITERATURE SIMILAR PRIORITY TO THAT GIVEN TO NATIONAL LITERATURE.

FORECASTS SOME OF THE FAR-REACHING EFFECTS THAT COMPUTER STORAGE AND
TRANSMISSION ARE LIKELY TO HAVE ON PEOPLE'S USE OF PUBLISHED MATERIAL, BOTH IN
TECHNICAL FIELDS AND IN SERIOUS FICTION AND ENTERTAINMENT.
AIP EN ROUTE TO DEMAND PUBLISHING.

THE DEVELOPMENT STEPS UNDERTAKEN BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS IN THEIR
MOVE TOWARDS A PRINT ON DEMAND SERVICE FOR THE JOURNALS AND DATA BASE IT
PUBLISHES ARE DESCRIBED. THESE INCLUDE CHANGING TO WEB OFFSET WITH AUTOMATIC
FOLDING AND SHRINKWRAPPING, IN-HOUSE COMPUTERISED COMPOSITION, AN ATEX
COMPUTERISED PRINTING SYSTEM AND PLANS FOR DIGITISED ILLUSTRATIONS. A SYSTEM
FOR TRANSMITTING THE FULL TEXT OF PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS FOR PRINTING INTO

DEVICE IS SOUGHT. THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF DEMAND PUBLISHING ARE
CONSIDERED.

USING A SEMANTIC DEFINITION OF REDUNDANCY (ADAPTED FROM COMMUNICATION THEORY),
RELATES THE READABILITY THRESHOLD TO A REDUNDANCY THRESHOLD AND DEFINES
READABILITY THROUGH REDUNDANT SEMANTIC FEATURES, THE EXTENT OF THEIR
INTERSECTION, AND THE CRITICAL INTERVAL BETWEEN RECURRENCES. READABILITY THUS
CONSISTS OF A BALANCE BETWEEN A SUPERSATURATION OF INTERCONNECTED ITEMS AND A
SUBSATURATION OF COMPATIBLE ITEMS WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A PROPORTION.
SENATE BILL ALLOWS AT & T'S ELECTRONIC YELLOW PAGES.

THE INTRODUCTION TO THE US SENATE OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND
DEREGULATION BILL WHICH GRANTS THE AMERICAN-TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO. THE

AN OVERVIEW OF CHINESE REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS (IN CHINESE).

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE 3312 CHINESE REFERENCE WORKS EXTANT. DISCUSSES THE TYPES
OF WORK AVAILABLE, SUCH AS BIBLIOGRAPHIES, INDEXES, DICTIONARIES, THESAURI,
ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND YEARBOOKS, THEIR CATEGORIES AND QUANTITIES, AND THE MERITS
AND DEFECTS IN THEIR COMPILATION.
EKARE PUBLICATIONS ARE A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANCO DEL LIBRO'S READING
PROMOTION POLICY.

THE TEXT OF A SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE VENEZUELAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE
PROMOTION OF CHILDREN'S READING. BY SPONSORING A NEW SERIES OF CHILDREN'S
BOOKS, THE BANCO DEL LIBRO IS LOGICALLY DEVELOPING THE POLICIES IT HAS ALWAYS
PURSUED.
USE OF GPO BOOKSTORES.

THE US GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE (GPO) OPENED ITS 1ST RETAIL BOOKSTORE
OUTSIDE THE WASHINGTON D.C. AREA IN 1967 AND NOW HAS 27 SALES OUTLETS ACROSS

PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' A NEW LAW IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE MAIN ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE UK LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
AGAINST THE 1979 PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ACT, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT OF
AUTHORS TO SOME FINANCIAL REWARD BASED ON THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEIR BOOKS
ARE BORROWED FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SUMMARISES THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ACT,
WHICH REQUIRES THE COMPILATION OF A REGISTER OF BOOKS AND AUTHORS ENTITLED TO
PAYMENT. DISCUSSES THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT ON THIS SCHEME WHICH WAS
PUBLISHED IN 1980, AND INDICATES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO

MICROFILMER.
PUTTING IT ON FILM.

COMPUTER OUTPUT TO MICROFILM (COM) HAS NOT BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL COMPUTING
TECHNIQUE, DUE PARTLY TO A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNOLOGY. RECENT COM
IMPROVEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE GREATER COMPETITION WITH
ALTERNATIVE METHODS. WITH MICROFILM, GOOD READABILITY AND HIGH QUALITY
TYPOGRAPHICAL LAYOUT CAN BE ACHIEVED AND NOW FEATURES, SUCH AS GRAPHICS, ARE
AVAILABLE.

ATTEMPTING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SEX STRUCTURING OF ORGANISATIONS, REVIEWS
LITERATURE ON SEX DIFFERENCES IN 3 AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO LEADERSHIP RESEARCH.
FINDING FEW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE LEADERS, SUGGESTS THE USE OF A
FRAMEWORK BASED ON SCHEIN'S CAREER STAGES FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE SEX
STRUCTURING PHENOMENON. FOR THE ADDENDUM TO THIS ARTICLE SEE THE FOLLOWING
SERIAL NUMBER:.
AN ADDENDUM TO THE SEX STRUCTURING OF ORGANIZATIONS: THE SPECIAL CASE OF
TRADITIONALLY-FEMALE PROFESSIONS.

GONE FICHE-ING..
     
MICROFICHE PROJECTION HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SLIDE OR
OVERHEAD PROJECTORS BY A SUCCESSION OF HARDWARE PRODUCERS. IT IS A VERY
ATTRACTIVE IDEA, BUT THERE ARE DRAWBACKS, INCLUDING AMBIENT LIGHT, THE NEED TO
USE THE FICHE IN ORDER WITH NO DODGING ABOUT BACK AND FORTH, AND THE INABILITY
OF THE PRESENTER TO DRAW OR WRITE ON THE FICHE.
LIBRARY PROBLEMS IN THE HUMANITIES' CASE STUDIES IN REFERENCE SERVICES,
COLLECTION BUILDING, AND MANAGEMENT.
     
A SERIES OF 28 CASE STUDIES DESIGNED FOR LIBRARIANSHIP STUDENTS TO ASSIST THEM
IN LEARNING TO COPE WITH LIBRARY PROBLEMS IN ART, LITERATURE, MYTHOLOGY,
MUSIC, PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION. ALSO TO BE USED FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING IN
LIBRARIES AND BY STUDENTS OF HUMANITIES.
THE PHILOSOPHY OF RECORDING KNOWLEDGE.
     
ALTHOUGH MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT HOW MANKIND HAS RECORDED KNOWLEDGE, THE
QUESTION OF WHY RECORD KNOWLEDGE AT ALL HAS NOT BEEN TREATED SYSTEMATICALLY.
INFERENCES AND DEDUCTIONS FROM HISTORICAL RECORDING FORMATS LEAD TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT WHILE TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED THE ART OF RECORD KEEPING, THE
UNDERLYING PURPOSES HAVE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME-TO COMMEMORATE,
COMMUNICATE, PRAY, CALCULATE, MEASURE, AND PRESERVE.

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A PARTNER' COMMENTARY AND REPORTS ON THE ANNUAL
CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, COLOGNE, MAY
81.
     
THE RUSSIAN AUTHOR LEV KOPELEV OPENED THE CONFERENCE OF THE VEREIN DER
BIBLIOTHEKARE AN OFFENTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN (ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES) WITH A TALK ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH, CONTRASTING THE AUTHOR'S
POSITION IN THE WEST AND IN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. THE CONFERENCE'S MAIN THEME
WAS PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION WITH OTHER CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS; SEVERAL
SPEAKERS ADVOCATED MORE ACTIVE COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND
MUSEUMS, ADULT EDUCATION CENTRES AND THEATRES. REPORTS ON THE LIBRARY'S ROLE
IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF LITERATURE, THE PREPARATION OF NEW KEYWORD CATALOGUING
RULES BY THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE, THE WORK OF THE INSTITUTE'S COMMITTEE
ON RAK (GERMAN ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING RULES) AND ADVANCED LIBRARIANSHIP
TRAINING WERE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED. THE CHAIRMAN'S REPORT COVERED
MEMBERSHIP INCREASES, CURRENT PRO GRESS IN SALARY NEGOTIATIONS AND FINANCE.
THE MINUTES OF THE MEMBERS' MEETING ON 28 MAY WERE INCLUDED.
SOLVING THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN LIBRARY SCIENCE ON THE
BASIS OF LENIN'S IDEAS.
     
LENIN'S WRITINGS AND STATEMENTS ABOUT LIBRARIANSHIP, TOGETHER WITH N.K.
KRUPSKAYA'S INTERPRETATION OF HIS IDEAS, FORM A BASIS FOR MODERN SOVIET
LIBRARIANSHIP. OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE TODAY ARE HIS IDEAS ON RESEARCH INTO
THE CULTURAL NEEDS AND READING INTERESTS OF THE SOVIET PEOPLE, THE NECESSITY
OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INTO BOTH SCHOOLS AND WORKPLACES, THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES
IN THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY AND THE NEED TO PROMOTE POLITICAL
AWARENESS THROUGH PROPAGANDA AND CULTURAL AWARENESS THROUGH READING GUIDANCE.
THE CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO THE ECONOMIC
EXPLOITATION AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE URALS, SIBERIA AND THE FAR EAST.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICE IN THESE AREAS IS YOUNG, BUT STATISTICS OF USAGE SHOW A
RAPID GROWTH. THE NEED FOR WELL-TRAINED STAFF AND FOR ADEQUATE TRANSPORT HAVE
BEEN KEY FACTORS IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. LIBRARIES THERE SPECIALISE IN INFORMATION
RELEVANT TO THE EXPLOITATION OF THE AREA'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND TO SUCH
PROJECTS AS THE BAIKAL-AMUR RAILWAY, IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF
LOCALLY-PRODUCED MATERIAL AND IN LOCAL HISTORY STUDIES. REQUIREMENTS FOR
IMPROVING THE SERVICE INCLUDE' (1) A MORE BALANCED GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
OF SERVICE POINTS; (2) THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SOME STOCK TO ENSURE BETTER
USAGE; (3) THE DISCOVERY, COLLECTION AND CIRCULATION OF MORE LOCAL MATERIAL;
(4) BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN BOTH LIBRARIES AND LOCAL MUSEUMS.
THE CHINESE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCENE' REFLECTIONS ON A VISIT TO CHINA IN
JUNE 80.
     
IMPRESSIONS GAINED DURING AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA IN JUNE 80. CHINA HAS A
FEW VERY LARGE LIBRARIES WITH STRONG COLLECTIONS AND GENEROUS FUNDING. MANY
OTHER LIBRARIES HAVE SERIOUS GAPS IN THEIR COLLECTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THE EMPHASIS IS ON ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES-THERE
SEEM TO BE NO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SERVICES ARE UNDEVELOPED, BUILDINGS AND
EQUIPMENT ARE NOT OF A HIGH QUALITY, THERE IS NO PLANNED INTERLENDING SYSTEM
OR LIBRARY COORDINATION, AND MOST RESEARCH IS CONCERNED WITH AUTOMATION AND
INFORMATION SYSTEMS RATHER THAN LIBRARIANSHIP. THE CHINESE WISH TO SOLVE THEIR
PROBLEMS THEMSELVES, ALTHOUGH THEY WELCOME HELP. THE WHOLE SITUATION IS IN A
STATE OF RAPID CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT.

CHANGES AND EXCHANGES' AUSTRALIAN VIEWPOINTS.
     
COLLECTED PAPERS BY THE LIBRARIANS-IN-RESIDENCE FROM THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION STUDIES, PRESENTED BETWEEN 1978 AND 79. THE SUBJECT MATTER IS
DISPARATE, RANGING FROM THE AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY SCENE TO LIBRARY PROBLEMS IN A
PERIOD OF FINANCIAL STRINGENCY. ALSO INCLUDED IS THE PROBLEM OF PROFESSIONAL
KNOWLEDGE IN LIBRARIANSHIP BY W. BOYD RAYWARD, VISITING LECTURER TO THE
COLLEGE.
LITERATURE REVIEW' LITERATURE ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS OF ACCESSING RECENT LITERATURE, BASED ON 10 ARTICLES
RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN UK AND US LIBRARIANSHIP JOURNALS. THE SURVEY DRAWS
TOGETHER POINTS MADE ABOUT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SOURCES AVAILABLE, AND AVAILABILITY
OF SPECIAL SUBJECT REVIEWS; AUDIO-VISUAL LITERATURE; PUBLISHERS IN THE FIELD
AND THEIR POLICIES; AND THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARIAN AS BOTH PRODUCER AND
CONSUMER OF SECONDARY SOURCES. THE RELATIVE ABSENCE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
MATERIALS IN SPANISH FOR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IS EMPHASISED.
RECENT AMERICAN LITERATURE ON LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
LITERATURE PUBLISHED ON LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE US IN RECENT YEARS REFLECTS THE
DEVELOPMENTS AND PROBLEMS IN THIS FIELD, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH ARE NEW
PLANS TO ORGANISE NATIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEMS MORE EFFICIENTLY, NEW FORMS OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF DATA PROCESSING
SYSTEMS. 1976 WAS THE CENTENARY OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND 2
IMPORTANT BOOKS WERE PUBLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OCCASION' 2AMERICAN
LIBRARY HISTORY-A BIBLIOGRAPHY1, AND 2DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN LIBRARY
BIOGRAPHY1. THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SCIENCE
(NCLIS) PUBLISHED ITS PROGRAMME IN 1975' 2TOWARDS A NATIONAL PROGRAM OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE1.
LIBRARY SCIENCE CONGRESSES' EVALUATION AND PERSPECTIVES.
     
REPORT ON THE AIMS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE 10TH BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCIENCE AND
DOCUMENTATION CONGRESS, COMPARING THE CAREFUL STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED HERE WITH
THE HAPHAZARD NATURE OF PREVIOUS MEETINGS. THE ACCOUNT ANALYSES THE PROBLEMS
PREVIOUSLY ENCOUNTERED IN CONFERENCE ORGANISATION, RESULTING IN LOSS OF
PRINCIPLE FOCUS AND DISSIPATION OF INTEREST. IN CONTRAST THIS CONGRESS WAS
BASED ON A DOMINANT CENTRAL THEME, SUB-THEMES WERE KEPT STRICTLY RELEVANT, AND
BOTH OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL PAPERS CAREFULLY MONITORED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF
PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA FOR SELECTING TOPICS AND PAPERS. THE SESSIONS,
DISCUSSION GROUPS AND WORKSHOPS WERE SIMILARLY CONTROLLED, TO ACHIEVE A
SESSION IN WHICH INTEREST AND PURPOSE WERE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT. SUGGESTS
FURTHER WAYS OF DEVELOPING THIS KIND OF CONGRESS ORGANISATION AND EMPHASISES
ITS BENEFITS TO THE PROFESSION AS A WHOLE AND INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS.
HERE IS THE (OTHER) NEWS.
     
DESCRIBES 2THE RADICAL BOOKSELLER1, THE ORGAN OF THE RADICAL BOOK TRADE, WHICH
WAS LAUNCHED IN AUTUMN 80 IN LONDON, BY A GROUP OF BOOKSELLERS, PUBLISHERS,
DISTRIBUTORS AND LIBRARIANS, WORKING WITH THE LONDON LABOUR LIBRARY. THE
PUBLICATION APPEARS MONTHLY, AND HAS PROVED EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL; IT LISTS
AROUND 80 ITEMS PER MONTH, WITH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS, AND CARRIES NEWS
ITEMS, CONFERENCE REPORTS AND OTHER MATERIAL WHICH MAY HAVE ESCAPED
LIBRARIANS' ATTENTION. THE MAGAZINE IS AVAILABLE ON SUBSCRIPTION AT *615 FOR
INSTITUTIONS AND *610 FOR INDIVIDUALS PER ANNUM. SPECIMEN COPIES ARE AVAILABLE

THE PROCESSES OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP (IN
ARABIC).
     
DEFINES THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF RESEARCH AS THE ORGANISED THOUGHT OR ACCURATE
STUDY THAT EMPLOYS SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA, PROVIDED
THAT IT IS NOT AFFECTED BY PERSONAL ATTITUDES WHICH MAY INFLUENCE THE
OUTCOMES. THIS METHOD CONSISTS OF 5 STEPS' SELECTION OF THE PROBLEM TO SUBMIT
TO INVESTIGATION; IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM; HYPOTHESES; COLLECTION OF
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROBLEM; AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION AND THE
PRESENTATION OF THE FINDINGS.
LIBRARY RESEARCH SHOULD BE DEFINED AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE.
     
COMMENTS ON A REPORT ON LIBRARY RESEARCH BY A COMMITTEE OF THE LIBRARIANS'
UNION. IT WRONGLY CONTRASTS LIBRARIANS AND ACADEMICS AS MOST LIBRARIANS HAVE
AN ACADEMIC TRAINING, BUT IT STRESSES THE NEED FOR A RESEARCH COUNCIL
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING LIBRARY RESEARCH IN ITS SPHERE. URGES THAT LIBRARY
RESEARCH SHOULD BE DEFINEED AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE, AND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE AN
AIM WIDER THAN THAT OF INCREASING EFFICIENCY. EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS SHOULD NOT
BE PART OF A LIBRARY RESEARCH COUNCIL, AS SUGGESTED IN THE REPORT. THE REPORT
RIGHTLY STRESSES THE NEED FOR FURTHER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS, BUT IS WRONGLY
AGAINST GIVING FORMAL CREDIT TO SUCH TRAINING IN THE FORM OF A DEGREE, FEARING
UNNECESSARILY THE CREATION OF ELITE LIBRARIANS.
RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IS THE NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTRE IN
THE FIELD OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. RESEARCH IS CARRIED OUT IN CLOSE
COOPERATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA, AS WELL AS REGIONAL CENTRAL
LIBRARIES AND SOME MAJOR LIBRARIES IN THE USSR. ALTHOUGH THE RESEARCH PROJECTS
PLANNED FOR THE 8TH 5-YEAR PLAN (1981-85) ARE STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC THEY ARE NOT
OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY. ALL TYPES OF THE COUNTRY'S LIBRARIES AND, INDEED,
THE LIBRARY NETWORK AS A WHOLE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESULTS. THE ISSUES UNDER
INVESTIGATION INCLUDE PROPAGANDA OF LITERATURE, GUIDED READING, OPEN ACCESS IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AUDIO-VISUAL RESOURCES, NEW SUBJECT CATALOGUES, LIBRARY
SERVICES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS, RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND THE RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE OF SPECIALISED BOOK COLLECTIONS TO PARTICULAR TYPES OF LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE LATE M.Z. BARKAI WHO SERVED IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES IN
THE JEWISH NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS. HE SERVED ON
MANY LIBRARY BODIES AND WAS ONE OF THE FOREMOST INDEXERS IN HEBREW. HE
COMPILED THE INDEXES TO THE 1ST YEARS OF THE KNESSET PAPERS, TO SEVERAL
PERIODICAL PUBLICATIONS AND TO THE HEBREW ENCYCLOPAEDIA. BIBLIOGRAPHY LISTS
HIS INDEXES, ARTICLES, BOOK REVIEWS, AND REPORTS PRESENTED BY HIM IN HIS
OFFICIAL CAPACITIES, AND ALSO SOME REVIEWS OF HIS INDEXES.
THOMAS GREENWOOD' PUBLIC LIBRARY ENTHUSIAST.
     
THOMAS GREENWOOD (1851-1908) WAS BORN INTO POVERTY AND HARDSHIP; MADE THE MOST
OF HIS EDUCATION BY READING EXTENSIVELY AND LATER ATTENDING A MUTUAL
IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY; AND EVENTUALLY BECAME A SUCCESSFUL PUBLISHER OF TECHNICAL
BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. WISHING TO HELP OTHERS MAKE THE BEST OF THEIR LIVES,
HIS MAIN PREOCCUPATION WAS WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES BECAUSE IN THEM HE DISCOVERED
AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION WHICH REFLECTED MANY OF HIS OWN IDEALS. FOR MUCH OF
HIS LIFE, HE GAVE UNSPARINGLY HIS TIME, MONEY, AND ENERGY TO THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY MOVEMENT.

GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION LIBRARY COMMITTEE.
     
AT ITS SPRING MEETING THE COMMITTEE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY IN BONN OVER THE 2-YEAR PERIOD
1982-84, TO BRING IT UP TO THE STANDARD OF OTHER FACULTY LIBRARIES NOW THAT
SUITABLE PREMISES ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IN BERLIN A PERIODICAL DATA BANK
WILL LINK THE FEDERAL STATES AND WILL INCLUDE HOLDINGS OF THE MAIN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS. THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS IN
SETTING UP AN INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE ARTS. IT WAS DECIDED TO PUBLISH A
CATALOGUE OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL AT GOTTINGEN AND TO PUT ON FILM THE CENTRAL
CATALOGUE FOR NORTH RHINELAND/WESTPHALIA.
CRITERIA FOR IMPROVING THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
DESCRIPTION OF THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS, CRITERIA, AND
RESPONSIBILITIES OF A TRUE PROFESSION PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE TRAITS

REVIEWS AND ALSO SOME NEW MATERIAL ON THE THEME OF INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM.
THEORY VS. PRACTICE' STUDENT PREFERENCES.
     
THE LONG-STANDING DISCUSSION OF THE THEORETICAL VERSUS THE PRACTICAL
ORIENTATION OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IS EXAMINED FROM THE STUDENT'S
PERSPECTIVE. RESULTS OF A SURVEY REVEAL THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH VARIABLES AS
SEX, TERM OF RESPONDENT, UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE, ADVANCED DEGREE,
PREPROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE, TYPE OF LIBRARY, PROFESSIONAL JOURNAL
SUBSCRIPTIONS, THE BROWSING OF LIBRARY LITERATURE ON THEIR THEORETICAL OR
PRACTICAL ORIENTATION AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A
LIBRARIAN.
DR. T. CHILDERS' VISITING FELLOWSHIP' FINAL REPORT.
     
DESIGNED TO RECORD THE PLANNING, ACTIVITIES AND ASSESSMENT OF THE VISITING
FELLOWSHIP OF DR. T. CHILDERS OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE,
DREXEL UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHIA, WHICH TOOK PLACE FROM SEPT TO DEC 78. THE
REPORT HAS BEEN COMPILED BY THE ORGANISER OF THE FELLOWSHIP AT THE LEEDS
SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP WHERE DR. CHILDERS WAS BASED, AND IT CONTAINS AN
ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIVITIES WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING THE FELLOWSHIP AND THE
RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS ARISING FROM IT.
A DIRECTED INDEPENDENT STUDY APPROACH TO A FOUNDATIONS COURSE.
     
OVER THE PAST DECADE THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE,
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, HAS TRIED SEVERAL APPROACHES TO PRESENTING THE
'FUNDAMENTALS' OF LIBRARIANSHIP TO STUDENTS. IN ITS PRESENT FORM, THE
'DIRECTED INDEPENDENT STUDY' APPROACH, THE FUNDAMENTALS COURSE CONSISTS OF A
SERIES OF MODULES. FOR EACH MODULE THE STUDENT RECEIVES A MINITEXT, A SET OF
READINGS AND A WORKBOOK. THE STUDENT MUST STUDY THE TEXT AND READINGS AND
COMPLETE THE WORKBOOK ASSIGNMENTS RELATED TO THIS MODULE. THE STUDENT PASSES
THE COURSE WHEN ALL COMPONENT MODULES ARE COMPLETED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE
STUDENT'S FACULTY ADVISOR. DISCUSSES THE REASONS FOR ABANDONING THE EARLIER
METHODS, THE EVOLUTION OF THE PRESENT FORMAT AND ITS ADVANTAGES AND
LIMITATIONS.
CONTINUING EDUCATION IN LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THE UNITED STATES.
     
A SUMMARY TRANSLATION OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAO PAULO IN 1979,
SURVEYING THE US SITUATION, WHERE THE NECESSITY FOR CONTINUING LIBRARY SCIENCE
EDUCATION IS GENERALLY AGREED, BUT SATISFACTORY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMMES
IS NOT YET FULLY ACHIEVED. THE ACCOUNT COVERS ACTIVITIES TO DATE BY THE
LIBRARY SCHOOLS, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND NATIONAL BODIES; THE FIELDS IN
WHICH TRAINING IS MOST ESSENTIAL; AND THE PROBLEMS OF SPONSORSHIP FOR COURSES,
SYSTEMS OF OFFICIAL RECOGNITION, AND LOCATION AND ORGANISATION.
LEARNING THE CONCEPT OF 'BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CITATION' USING THE 'SET OF CONCEPTS'
METHOD' A STUDY COMPARING THIS METHOD WITH TRADITIONAL LEARNING METHOD.
     
IN A THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION, THE METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE 'SET OF
CONCEPTS' LEARNING PROCEDURE IS EXPLAINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE LITERATURE.
THE PERFORMANCES OF 2 GROUPS OF STUDENTS IN LEARNING THE NEW CONCEPT OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION, ONE USING A TEXTBOOK AND THE OTHER THE 'SET OF
CONCEPTS' METHOD, WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE TEST
GROUPS, TEST CONDITIONS, AND TEST PROCEDURES. THE TECHNIQUE USED TO EVALUATE
RESULTS IS OUTLINED AND CALCULATIONS PRESENTED IN FULL, WITH TABULAR
SUMMARIES. THE CONCLUDING DISCUSSION REFERS TO OTHER STUDIES CORROBORATING THE
SUPERIOR EFFICIENCY OF THE NEW METHOD, REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE.
AN INTEGRATED PROFICIENCY APPROACH TO PRE-PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING.
     
TAKING AS A STARTING POINT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE ON
ACCREDITATION'S LIST OF ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL LIBRARIANS, PRESENTS A
DETAILED ITEMISATION OF THE MINIMUM PROFESSIONAL SKILLS ESSENTIAL FOR A
PRE-SERVICE LIBRARIAN, STRUCTURED IN 6 PRINCIPLE DIVISIONS, COVERING
UNDERSTANDING OF' THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNICATION OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE;
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SCIENCE; COLLECTION BUILDING; ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS; LIBRARY SERVICES; AND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. APPLICATIONS OF THIS
ANALYTICAL PRESCRIPTION IN PLANNING AND EVALUATING CURRICULA ARE SUGGESTED,
WHICH WOULD ENSURE INCLUSION OF ALL ESSENTIAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND THEORETICAL
COMPONENTS IN TRAINING PROGRAMMES.
ALTERNATIVE MODES FOR PROVIDING GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP IN OHIO.
FINAL REPORT.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF THE GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP IN OHIO
PROJECT'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE NEED FOR AND PROVISION OF GRADUATE LIBRARY
EDUCATION IN THE STATE. PROVIDES INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE 4 OPTIONS STUDIED
AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THIS REPORT WILL FOSTER FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF
ALTERNATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCH EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE, ESPECIALLY
THOSE WHICH MAXIMISE ACCESS TO STATE RESIDENTS CONVENIENTLY AND
COST-EFFECTIVELY.
PARTICULAR PROBLEMS IN THE TRAINING OF HIGHER-QUALIFIED LIBRARY AND RESEARCH
STAFF.
     
MANY LIBRARY SCHOOLS SUFFER FROM HAVING TOO FEW QUALIFIED LECTURERS,
OVER-LOADED AND ILL-PLANNED SYLLABUSES, AND FROM PAYING TOO LITTLE ATTENTION
TO POST-GRADUATE WORK. UNTIL THESE FAULTS ARE REMEDIED THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF
IMPROVING SIGNIFICANTLY THE FURTHER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS. THERE IS A NEED
FOR A MORE GENERAL SYLLABUS, SO THAT STUDENTS EMERGE WITH DETAILED KNOWLEDGE
OF A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS NEED TO BE MORE
CAREFULLY SELECTED AND THEIR DISSERTATIONS MORE CLOSELY SUPERVISED.
THE ROLE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARY STAFF.
     
LIBRARIANS NEED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF PSYCHOLOGY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE
EFFECTIVE READING GUIDANCE TO LIBRARY USERS. PSYCHOLOGY SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL
PART OF THE SYLLABUS TAUGHT IN LIBRARY SCHOOLS, WITH A STUDY OF GENERAL
PRINCIPLES LEADING ON TO MORE SPECIALISED FIELDS. THE COURSE TAUGHT AT THE
LENINGRADSKII GOSUDARSTVENNYI INSTITUT KUL'TURY IM. N.K. KRUPSKOI (N.K.
KRUPSKAYA STATE INSTITUTE OF CULTURE IN LENINGRAD) SHOWS SOME OF THE
POSSIBILITIES AVAILABLE, BUT THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN THE PROFESSION
AS A WHOLE.
TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION LIBRARIANS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. DISCUSSES THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION (BI) MOVEMENT IN US LIBRARIES,
AND DESCRIBES THE THRUST OF THE BI EDUCATION EFFORT OVER THE PAST DECADE AS IT
EMANATES FROM CONTINUING EDUCATION. REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALA
RELATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC PROGRAMMES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INSTRUCTION CONCEPT. CONSIDERS SOME REASONS FOR THE RESISTANCE OF LIBRARY
SCHOOLS TO ADDING COURSES THAT WOULD TRAIN PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS FOR
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT RECOGNITION OF THE NEED
FOR FORMAL TRAINING FOR THE TEACHING LIBRARIAN OR THE TEACHER OF BIBLIOGRAPHY
WILL STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING.
THE DEVELOPMENT AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CORE CURRICULUM IN ARCHIVES, LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION STUDIES.
     
(PHD THESIS.) AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN ARCHIVES,
LIBRARY, AND INFORMATION STUDIES FROM WHICH A CORE CURRICULUM COULD BE DERIVED
FOR THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE 3 FIELDS. THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT IS THAT THE 3
FIELDS MUST BE VIEWED AS A WHOLE WITHIN THE INFORMATION SPECTRUM. THE
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP; EARLY LIBRARY EDUCATION IN THE UK,
USA, AND BRAZIL; PRESENT AND FUTURE TRENDS TOWARDS PARTICIPATION IN
INFORMATION NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS; AND LIKELY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS ARE ALL
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. CURRENT GENERAL EDUCATION TRENDS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
MODEL OF INFORMATION TRAINING SPECIALISATION.
     
THE TRAINING SPECIALISATION PROCESS IN THE INSTITUTE FOR THE ADVANCED TRAINING
OF INFORMATION WORKERS, MOSCOW, IS REPRESENTED BY A STOCHASTIC HIERARCHICAL
CONTINUOUSLY-DEVELOPING STRUCTURE HAVING PARAMETERS DEPENDENT ON THE
DEVELOPMENT PATTERN OF THE STATEWIDE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM. THE INSTITUTE'S REALISED AND PLANNED TRAINING SPECIALISATIONS DERIVED
FROM THE MODEL IN QUESTION ARE LISTED.
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION WITHIN THE MEDICAL RECORD ADMINISTRATION CURRICULUM.
     
THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE CENTER FOR THE HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY HAS
DEVELOPED A COURSE FOR MEDICAL RECORD ADMINISTRATION STUDENTS WHICH IS
INTENDED TO (1) TRAIN STUDENTS IN THE USE OF HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY RESOURCES
AND SERVICES AND (2) PROVIDE BASIC INSTRUCTION IN THE ORGANISATION, OPERATION,
AND MANAGEMENT OF A SMALL HOSPITAL LIBRARY. OUTLINES THE NEED FOR SUCH A
COURSE, BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE CURRICULUM, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY
OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE COURSE.

TEACHING AND TRAINING FOR ON-LINE WORK IN LIBRARIES.
     
FINAL REPORT OF A PROJECT WHICH EXAMINED THE METHODS OF TEACHING AND TRAINING
RELATING TO ON-LINE WORK IN LIBRARIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO COST. THE COST
OF USING OUTHOUSE DATA BASES (LOCKHEED DIALOG AND BLAISE MARC) WITHIN
PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF INHOUSE PACKAGES WAS INVESTIGATED.
INHOUSE PROGRAMMES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PRACTICE WORK-THE BLAISE EDITOR WOULD BE
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TO USE. SOFTWARE FOR HANDLING MARC WAS FOUND TO BE
GENERALLY INADEQUATE. THE HEWLETT-PACKARD 2645A DISPLAY STATION WAS FOUND
ACCEPTABLE FOR TRAINING PURPOSES.
STUDENT'S GUIDE TO SOME LIBRARIES IN SUSSEX.
     
INTENDED TO HELP THE PURPOSIVE USER TO IDENTIFY THOSE SUSSEX LIBRARIES WHICH

MEDICAL LIBRARIANS AND THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE' FROM COMPLACENCY, TO
CONCERN, TO COMMITMENT.
     
THE ATTITUDE OF US MEDICAL LIBRARIANS TOWARDS THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES (HELD IN NOV 79) WAS SLOW TO EVOLVE FROM THE
INITIAL COMPLACENCY TO A STRONG COMMITMENT. DESCRIBES THIS EVOLUTION AND
OUTLINES THE PARTICIPATION OF MEDICAL LIBRARIANS AND THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION IN CONFERENCE-RELATED ACTIVITIES.
WHERE THERE IS NO VISION THE PEOPLE PERISH.
     
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C., 17 JUNE 80. FORCES ARE ALREADY IN MOTION THAT
WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE OF HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIANSHIP. IN ADDITION TO
CHANGES IN ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTRES, CHANGES IN THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY, THE
MODE OF DELIVERING INFORMATION BY LIBRARIANS, USE OF COMPUTERS IN INFORMATION
MANIPULATION AND RETRIEVAL, USERS' ACCESS TO INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY ARE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. PROPOSES THAT HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIANS CAN
PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING THEIR PROFESSIONAL FUTURE
BY BEING INFORMED, EXPANDING COOPERATIVE EFFORTS, PLANNING, CEASING TO HOLD A
ROMANTIC VIEW OF THE PROFESSION, AND BECOMING ACHIEVERS RATHER THAN
SUSTAINERS.
THE ROUND TABLE OF ART LIBRARIANS.
     
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE IFLA ROUND TABLE OF ART LIBRARIANS SINCE ITS
ESTABLISHMENT IN 1977 ARE COVERED. ALSO INCLUDED ARE ITS MEDIUM-TERM
PROGRAMME, ITS OBJECTIVES AND ITS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.
THE INFORMATION SYSTEM OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK FEDERAL ASSEMBLY.

LIBRARY, AN ARCHIVE AND A PRESS OFFICE. ITS MAIN TASK IS TO PROVIDE
INFORMATION TO THE MPS THROUGH ITS BOOK AND PERIODICAL COLLECTIONS AND THROUGH
ARCHIVAL MATERIAL CONTAINING DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
CZECHOSLOVAK REPUBLIC. BASIC INFORMATION ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANS OF
THE PARLIAMENT IS PROVIDED BY A BULLETIN. THE HISTORY AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE
LIBRARY, FOUNDED IN 1918, ARE GIVEN IN GREATER DETAIL.
REPORT OF THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SERVICES TO GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND INSTRUMENTALITIES.

A COMMISSION WITH POSSIBILITIES-IN SPITE OF ALL.
     
DISCUSSES THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION
(FOLKBIBLIOTEKSUTREDNINGEN) IN SWEDEN AFTER 1 YEAR'S WORK. SUGGESTS THAT THE
COMMISSION SHOULD FORMULATE NOT ONLY CULTURAL, BUT ALSO SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL
GOALS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT SHOULD INDICATE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES IN
COOPERATION WITH SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION ORGANISATIONS CAN SAVE THE BOOK
AT A TIME WHEN AURAL AND VISUAL MEDIA THREATEN TO TAKE OVER. TO THIS END THE
COMMISSION HAS BEGUN TO COOPERATE WITH THE CULTURAL COUNCIL'S PLANNED
LITERATURE CAMPAIGN IN THE KOPPARBERG REGION. THE COMMISSION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
THE EQUALISATION OF SERVICES BY PLACING MORE EMPHASIS ON THE REGIONAL
LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THIS RESPECT. ANY EXTRA MONEY SHOULD BE CHANNELLED THROUGH
THE REGIONAL LIBRARY.
A REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN EAST
AFRICA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY SYSTEM
FAVOURED BY THE WEST IS APPLICABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO
STUDY THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN A PARTICULAR AREA, ITS
CURRENT STATUS, AND ITS PLANNED FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
(KENYA, UGANDA, AND TANZANIA) WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY AS ITS LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY LONG TO ENABLE A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT ANALYSIS.
IN FUTURE, THERE MUST BE A BALANCE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF APPOSITE WESTERN
IDEAS AND REJECTION OF THOSE IDEAS HARMFUL TO THE COMMUNITY. FINANCIAL SUPPORT
IS BECOMING MORE ASSURED; THE RECOGNITION OF LOCAL REQUIREMENTS MUST FOLLOW.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN A FREE ENTERPRISE SOCIETY.
     
STATES THAT THE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS PRESENT FORM IS A UNIQUELY US
INSTITUTION, REFLECTING THE NATION'S COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE AND
FREE ENTERPRISE-READY ACCESS TO BOOKS FOR SELF-HELP AND SELF-IMPROVEMENT HAS
BEEN PERCEIVED AS ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING CHARACTER AND SELF-RELIANCE FOR
GENERATIONS. TRACES THE VITAL ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE LIVES OF LEADING
US INVENTORS, BUSINESSMEN, AND INDUSTRIES AND CALLS FOR SUPPORT FOR LIBRARIES
(THROUGH THE PROPOSED NATIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES ACT) IN THEIR
PRESENT FINANCIALLY-STRAINED CIRCUMSTANCES.
A LIBRARY IS FOR THE PUBLIC.
     
US PUBLIC LIBRARIES REPRESENT THE IDEAL (GOALS WHICH ARE ALWAYS BEING PURSUED)
AND THE REAL (PRACTICES WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED LEST NIHILISM RESULT).
PRACTICALITY HAS REVEALED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE FOR ALL PEOPLE, INCLUDING
THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OF ALL RACES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF
LIBRARIES FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ALL, THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES WITHIN THE
LIBRARY, AND THE EXTENSION OF THE LIBRARY'S FACILITIES OUTSIDE ITS BUILDING.
IN THIS WAY, THE REAL IS REALISED AND THE IDEAL IS STILL PURSUED.
RURAL LIBRARIES IN WEST MALAYSIA WITH RECOMMENDATIONS.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING INTEREST IN
RURAL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES IN WEST MALAYSIA. DISCUSSES
THE SERVICES OFFERED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY
CORPORATIONS AND PROBLEMS. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOPES THAT THE
CORPORATIONS WILL ABSORB THE VARIOUS RURAL LIBRARIES ALREADY ESTABLISHED INTO
THEIR OWN SYSTEMS AS SOON AS IT IS FEASIBLE.
LIBRARY SERVICES FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES' A STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEW.
     
IN MAR 77 THE BRITISH LIBRARY COMMISSIONED A BRIEF STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT ON
THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES BASED ON RELEVANT UK
AND OVERSEAS PRACTICE. IT WAS FOUND THAT OBJECTIVES AND THE RANGE, LEVEL AND
TYPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS USED VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY
BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN LIBRARY AUTHORITIES.
MOBILE LIBRARY IN JORDAN (IN ARABIC).
     
IN JORDAN, THE 1ST MOBILE LIBRARY WAS FOUND IN HEBRON BY THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION IN 1956. IN 1970 THERE WERE ABOUT 15 MOBILE LIBRARIES BUT THIS
NUMBER GRADUALLY DECREASED AND NOW THERE ARE ONLY 3; IN IRBID, ZARKA AND HAYA
CULTURAL CENTRE IN AMMAN. THE PROBLEMS OF THE MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE ARE
CAUSED BY THE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY MATERIALS.
ARE MOBILE LIBRARIES A PROFITABLE MEANS OF PROVIDING LITERATURE FOR
STRUCTURALLY WEAK AREAS?.
     
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT. A COMPARISON
BETWEEN MOBILE AND SMALL VILLAGE LIBRARIES SHOWS THAT MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE,
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION, CHEAPER TO RUN; THEY HAVE LARGER AND MORE
FREQUENTLY CHANGED STOCKS AND DO NOT HAVE TO PAY OVERHEADS FOR HEATING AND
LIGHTING. VILLAGE LIBRARIES CANNOT BE CULTURAL CRYSTALLISATION CENTRES IF
THEIR STOCKS ARE INADEQUATE. CHILDREN ARE THE MAIN USERS OF VILLAGE LIBRARIES,
WHICH THEREFORE STOCK MAINLY CHILDREN'S BOOKS. MOBILE LIBRARIES CARRY A LARGER
PROPORTION OF ADULT MATERIAL; FEWER CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE NEEDED HERE SINCE THE
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD SCHOOL LIBRARIES. GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE
PROVISION IS ALWAYS PROFITABLE AND IN CONTRAST WITH VILLAGE LIBRARIES, MOBILE
LIBRARIES ALWAYS HAVE QUALIFIED STAFF. THE TRAVELLING LIBRARY IS A GOOD
ADVERTISEMENT FOR LIBRARY SERVICES.
THE ELGIN COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
THE ELGIN COUNTY (ONTARIO) LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WAS FOUNDED IN 1936; IT WAS A
COOPERATIVE VENTURE AND BY 1964 IT HAD 12 MEMBER LIBRARIES. THESE WERE
INDEPENDENT LIBRARIES AND MOST HAD SOMEWHAT PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM
THE COUNTY COUNCIL, LOCAL COUNCIL, AND INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND
ORGANISATIONS. IN 1964, A FULLY TAX SUPPORTED COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS
SUGGESTED TO REPLACE THE ASSOCIATION. THIS WAS AGREED AND THE NEW SYSTEM WAS
FOUNDED IN 1966. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE SYSTEM'S DEVELOPMENT TO DATE,
FINANCING, AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.
SCOTLAND 1980 (PART TWO). LIBRARIES VISITED IN GLASGOW AND EDINBURGH.
     
THE CONCLUSION OF THE REPORT OF A STUDY VISIT TO SCOTLAND BY A GROUP OF FRENCH
PUBLIC LIBRARIANS. (FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 82/550) A VERY DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS
GIVEN OF GLASGOW'S CENTRAL REFERENCE LIBRARY, THE MITCHELL' POINTS COVERED
INCLUDE BUILDING STATISTICS, FACILITIES, LAYOUT, AND HOLDINGS; PLANS OF ALL 7
FLOORS ARE INCLUDED. BRIEFER ACCOUNTS COVER 2 CENTRAL AREA LIBRARIES, 1 OLD
AND 1 NEW; 3 BRANCH LIBRARIES; AND THE CITY'S OTHER REFERENCE LIBRARY. THE
ORGANISATION AND POLICY OF THE GLASGOW PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IS FULLY
DESCRIBED. A SUCCINCT ACCOUNT OF EDINBURGH'S CENTRAL LIBRARY IS GIVEN, AND IN
CONCLUSION SOME COMPARISONS ARE DRAWN WITH THE FRENCH PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM.
HOUSTON PUBLIC LIBRARIES ANNUAL REPORT, 1979.
     
THE NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED JULIA IDESON BUILDING, CENTRAL LIBRARY PUBLIC SERVICE
PROGRAMME, BRANCH AND EXTENSION AND SERVICES, SUPPORT SERVICES, AND THE

ENVISIONS POSSIBLE FUTURE ROLES. TERMINOLOGY CURRENT IN THE FIELD IS DEFINED.
A HISTORY OF MATERIALS CENTRES IS TRACED FROM THE 20S WHEN CURRICULUM
LABORATOREIS WERE FIRST CONCEPTUALISED, AND FOCUSES ON 2 AREAS' THE COLLECTION
OF TEACHING MATERIALS OF ALL KINDS, AND THE WORKSHOP OR LABORATORY FOR
DEVELOPING AND CONSTRUCTING CURRICULUM AND SUPPLEMENTARY TEACHING MATERIALS.

THE TRIER LIBRARY MODEL.
     
THE TRIER UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN AUTUMN 70 SHORTLY BEFORE THE
UNIVERSITY ITSELF. IT FACED MANY PROBLEMS FROM THE START AND THEY HAVE NOT YET
ALL BEEN SOLVED ALTHOUGH THE LIBRARY IS NOW OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY. IT IS RUN
AS AN INTEGRATED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THIS SYSTEM BROUGHT CONSIDERABLE
OPPOSITION FROM UNIVERSITY STAFF WHO PREFERRED TRADITIONAL INSTITUTE
LIBRARIES. THE LIBRARY IS IDEALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR ITS PURPOSE, AND TECHNICAL
FACILITIES, PRESENTATION AND CONTENT OF LIBRARY STOCK ARE ALSO SATISFACTORY.
THE PROBLEMS STILL EXISTING ARE CONNECTED TO THE UNIVERSITY LAWS CONCERNING
THE LIBRARY WHICH DO NOT GUARANTEE THE COMPETENCE OF THE LIBRARY DIRECTOR IN
LIBRARY MATTERS. THIS HAS LED TO INTERFERENCE IN LIBRARY AFFAIRS BY OTHER
UNIVERSITY BODIES AND DEMANDS FOR SPECIAL USER RIGHTS BY UNIVERSITY STAFF.
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN MALAYSIA' A DESCRIPTIVE OUTLOOK.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) OUTLINES THE MALAYSIAN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE
GENERAL ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE MALAYSIAN UNIVERSITIES. DESCRIBES THE
GENERAL BACKGROUND, COLLECTION, STAFFING, ACCOMMODATION, SERVICES AND
FACILITIES, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES OF THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF

A LIVING-ROOM FOR THE WHOLE TOWN.
     
A REPORT ON NAKSKOV NEW MAIN LIBRARY, A COMBINED PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARY.
THE 3190 SQ.M. AREA IS SPLIT UP BY SHELVES, MOVEABLE PARTITION WALLS AND 4
LARGE GARDEN AREAS. ALTHOUGH THE PRIME FUNCTION IS TO BE A PUBLIC LIBRARY, AN
AGREEMENT WITH THE ADJACENT EDUCATIONAL CENTRE, HOUSING COMMERCIAL, TECHNICAL
AND SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS, ALLOWS THE CENTRE USE OF THE LIBRARY AGAINST A
PAYMENT OF 300,000 KR. ANNUALLY TO BE USED PARTLY ON SALARY TO A LIBRARIAN. IT
IS HOPED THAT THE SPECIALISED MATERIAL TO BE ACQUIRED FOR THE STUDENTS WILL
ALSO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC AND THAT THE 130 SEAT THEATRE HALL WILL ATTRACT A
READY AUDIENCE FROM THE SCHOOLS. INTERVIEWS WITH LIBRARIANS REVEAL
DETERMINATION TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND BY PLACEMENT
OF THE EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT FURTHEST AWAY AVOID DOMINANCE BY THE STUDENT
USERS.
SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES' POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY A
SCHOOL IN PFULLINGEN.
     
IN MOST SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA HAVE TAKEN SECOND PLACE TO
PRINTED WORKS, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE ONLY SPORADICALLY
USED AS A BASE FOR TEACHING. DEMONSTRATES THE REQUIREMENTS, POSSIBILITIES AND
LIMITATIONS OF THE INCORPORATION OF MEDIA CENTRES IN THE LEARNING PROCESSES IN
A SCHOOL SETTING, USING A SCHOOL IN PFULLINGEN AS A CASE STUDY. SHOWS THAT THE
MEDIA CENTRE IS AFFECTED STRONGLY BY THE GENERAL UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE
USE OF MEDIA IN SCHOOLS.
A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF ESEA TITLE II FUNDS ON THE PUBLIC SCHOOL MEDIA
CENTERS OF PENNSYLVANIA.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH.) THE EFFECT OF TITLE II OF THE 1965 US
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT ON PENNSYLVANIAN SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
CENTRES WAS STUDIED. THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT FEDERAL FUNDING UNDER TITLE
II HAS HAD A DEMONSTRABLE, POSITIVE EFFECT ON SCHOOL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARY SURVEY.
     
PRESENTS THE MAIN RESULTS FROM A SAMPLE SURVEY OF LIBRARIES IN MAINTAINED
SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND IN MAR 79. THESE INDICATE' A WIDE VARIATION OF
LIBRARY PROVISION; 2% HAD NO LIBRARY AT ALL OR NO LIBRARY ON 1 OF THEIR SPLIT
SITES; AVERAGE FACILITIES WERE 20 SQM. FLOOR AREA AND 5.7 STUDY PLACES PER 100
PUPILS; OPENING AND STAFFING HOURS RANGED FROM ZERO (4% OF SCHOOLS) TO AT
LEAST 20 HOURS/WEEK (44%); OVER 3/4 EMPLOYED A TEACHER WITH NO PROFESSIONAL
LIBRARY QUALIFICATIONS AS LIBRARIAN; AVERAGE STOCK WAS 8.6 BOOKS PER CHILD;
ADDITIONS IN 1978-79 ACCOUNTED FOR 7% OF LIBRARY STOCK; AND AVERAGE
EXPENDITURE ON LIBRARY BOOKS WAS *693 PER 100 PUPILS.
PUBLIC LIBRARY PROVISION TO SMALL, DISPERSED ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN GREAT
BRITAIN.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION). PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE SENT
TO INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN 28 UK LIBRARY AUTHORITIES (14 REPLIED) CONCERNING
THE LOCAL CHINESE COMMUNITY (ITS ESTIMATED SIZE, SOURCE OF ESTIMATION, AND
SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES), OTHER SMALL ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS, AND SERVICES TO
ETHNIC MINORITIES IN GENERAL. DISCUSSES THE BACKGROUND OF THE UK'S SCATTERED
CHINESE, THEIR LIBRARY SERVICE REQUIREMENTS (EXPRESSED IN INTERVIEWS), AND HOW
LIBRARIES CAN RESPOND.
DANISH CULTURAL OUTPOST IN THE SOUTH LACKS ELBOWROOM.
     
DESCRIBES THE DANISH LIBRARY SERVICE IN SOUTH SCHLESWIG, WEST GERMANY. THE
DANISH CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR SOUTH SCHLESWIG IS HOUSED IN FLENSBURG. THE LIBRARY
HAS SEEN RAPID INCREASES IN STOCK AND LOANS, ESPECIALLY TO YOUNG PEOPLE, SINCE
1960. THE BUILDING ALSO ACTS AS A CENTRE FOR THE DANISH SOCIETIES' CULTURAL
ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEED FOR MORE SPACE IS GROWING AND AN EXTENSION IS PLANNED.
INTERVIEWS KARL OTTO MEYER, THE LEADER OF THE DANISH MINORITY, WHO IS FIGHTING
FOR FUNDS FOR THE EXTENSION. THE DANISH STATE PAYS 90% OF EXPENSES, THE GERMAN
LAND GOVERNMENT THE REST. INTERVIEWS JORGEN HAMRE, THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN, WHO
DESCRIBES THE INTEREST IN DANISH CIVILISATION WHICH LIES BEHIND THE INCREASING
USE OF THE LIBRARY. INCLUDES INTERVIEWS WITH USERS OF THE CHILDREN'S SECTION,
WHICH CONTAINS DANISH BOOKS ONLY. OLDER CHILDREN FROM THE DANISH SCHOOLS
BORROW NON-FICTION MATERIAL FOR USE IN CLASS WORK. THE DANISH LIBRARY IN HUSUM
LENDS MAINLY THROU GH THE DANISH SCHOOLS.
DEVELOPING LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR AMERICANS OF HISPANIC ORIGIN.
     
DIVIDING US-RESIDENT HISPANICS INTO 3 GROUPS (CUBANS, MEXICAN-AMERICANS, AND
PUERTO RICANS) AND ADDING A 4TH RELATED GROUP (THE LATINOS FROM SOUTH AND
CENTRAL AMERICA), DESCRIBES THEIR HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, COMMON LINKS, AND
GROUP CHARACTERISTICS. DISCUSSES LIBRARY SERVICES FOR CHILDREN, PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICES, ACADEMIC LIBRARY SERVICES, AND THE EVALUATION OF LIBRARY HOLDINGS,
SERVICES, AND STAFF. REVIEWS MAJOR LATIN AMERICAN COLLECTIONS IN THE USA AND
ASSESSES THEIR IMPORTANCE. CALLS FOR A NATIONAL POLICY CONFERENCE.
LIBRARY SERVICES IN NORDKALOTTEN).A
     
 SPECIAL SECTION ON NORWEGIAN, SWEDISH, AND FINNISH LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE
SAMIS; THESE ARE INHABITANTS OF NORDKALOTTEN, THAT PART OF SCANDINAVIA WITHIN
THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT, EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO PRESERVE
THE SAMI LANGUAGE AND CULTURE, A FEW SAMI LANGUAGE BOOKS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED,
AND THE CHILDREN ARE BEING TAUGHT THE LANGUAGE IN SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH MANY ARE
NOW RESIDENT FARMERS AND FISHERMEN, SOME SAMI ARE STILL NOMADIC. LIBRARY
SERVICES FACE GREAT DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE OF THE SCATTERED POPULATION AND VAST
DISTANCES. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'.
THE LIBRARIES IN LAPLAND.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON LIBRARY SERVICES IN NORDKALOTTEN, THAT PART OF
SCANDINAVIA WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. STATISTICS INDICATE THAT PUBLIC
LIBRARIES IN LAPLAND PROVINCE, FINLAND, HAVE DEVELOPED EXTRAORDINARILY WELL,
BUT IN TRUTH PUBLIC LIBRARY CONDITIONS VARY FROM EXCELLENT TO ABOUT AVERAGE.
DISCUSSES THE CONTRIBUTION LIBRARIES COULD MAKE TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF
KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION, LITERATURE, AND OTHER CULTURAL MATERIALS IN THE
PROVINCE AND DESCRIBES HOW THE LIBRARIES COULD BECOME FOCAL POINTS FOR THE
SCATTERED COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.
SAMI LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON LIBRARY SERVICES IN NORDKALOTTEN, THAT PART OF
SCANDINAVIA WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. KAROSJOK LIBRARY HAS 3 MAIN FUNCTIONS'
GENERAL LIBRARY FOR KARASJOK MUNICIPALITY (IN THE COUNTY OF FINNMARK, NORWAY);
SPECIAL SAMI LIBRARY (8% OF KARASJOK'S 2,633 INHABITANTS ARE INDIGENOUS SAMI
AND THEIR COLLECTION HAS 7,850 BOOKS AND IS GROWING); AND SAMI HIGH SCHOOL
LIBRARY. IT INTENDS TO SERVE ALL CONCEIVABLE BORROWER GROUPS WORLDWIDE WHO
WISH TO HAVE LITERATURE ABOUT THE SAMI. DESCRIBES THE LIBRARY'S ACHIEVEMENTS
AND THE GROWTH OF LITERATURE IN THE SAMI LANGUAGE.
THE TORNEDALEN LIBRARY.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON LIBRARY SERVICES IN NORDKALOTTEN, THAT PART OF
SCANDINAVIA WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. TORNEDALEN IS THE AREA IN SWEDEN ALONG
THE BORDER WITH FINLAND. THE TORNEDALEN LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1928 WITH
THE AIM OF PROVIDING 'GOOD SWEDISH LITERATURE'. DESPITE SUCH ATTEMPTS TO
'SWEDIFY' THE AREA, 70 OF THE LOCAL POPULATION STILL HAVE FINNISH AS THEIR
MOTHER TONGUE AND THE LIBRARY'S AIM TODAY IS TO PROVIDE LITERATURE THAT LOCAL
PEOPLE CAN READ. 1/3 OF ITS BOOKSTOCK IS IN FINNISH AND IT HAS A 5,500-ITEM
COLLECTION ON NORDKALOTTEN. ITS 4 MAIN FUNCTIONS ARE' MUNICIPAL PUBLIC LIBRARY
FOR OVERTORNEA; FOLK HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY; TORNEDALEN REGIONAL LIBRARY; AND
RESEARCH LIBRARY.
CONTRIBUTIONS OF BLACK ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE BLACK
COMMUNITY.
     
(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE). FOR MANY
YEARS PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SOUTHERN USA NEGLECTED SERVICES TO BLACK PROSPECTIVE
PATRON. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BLACK ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OFFERED THE ONLY SOLUTION
TO AN ILLITERATE BLACK SOCIETY. STUDIES COMMUNITY SERVICES FROM BLACK ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1940-70. SOME ACHIEVEMENTS WERE MADE DURING THIS PERIOD
DESPITE BUDGET RESTRICTIONS. DESCRIBES THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF BLACK
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND CONCENTRATES PARTICULARLY ON TALLADEGA COLLEGE
LIBRARY. ALSO DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE SENT TO 25 BLACK
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
A BABEL OF CONCRETE.
     
REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY SERVICE TO IMMIGRANTS ORGANISED BY THE
DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, MAR 81, AND HELD IN ISHOJ, WHICH HAS DENMARK'S
LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF IMMIGRANTS WITH 50 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY A
POPULATION OF 21,000. THE MAYOR OF ISHOJ ARGUED THAT IMMIGRANTS MUST
ASSIMILATE AND LEARN DANISH, WHEREAS THE 3 IMMIGRANT SPOKESMAN CLAIMED THAT
CHILDREN MUST LEARN THEIR MOTHER TONGUE PROPERLY BEFORE THEY CAN LEARN DANISH,
IF THEY ARE NOT TO BE CULTURALLY ISOLATED, KNOWING 2 LANGUAGES ONLY PARTLY.
BOOK PROVISION WAS 6 BOOKS PER DANE, BUT ONLY 1/2 PER IMMIGRANT. THE
LIBRARIANS PRESENT POINTED OUT THE ENORMITY OF THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARY
PROVISION TO IMMIGRANTS SPEAKING SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AND ASKED FOR
MORE BILINGUAL LIBRARIANS AND CLOSER CONTACT WITH SCHOOLS ON MATTERS OF
LINGUISTIC BACKGROUND AND BOOK SELECTION.
THE APPLICATION OF READABILITY AND OTHER TECHNIQUES OF LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS TO
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. FINAL REPORT FOR THE PERIOD MARCH-MAY 1979.
     
13 CITIES WERE VISITED TO MEET EXPERTS ON READING, EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, DATA
PROCESSING, LINGUISTICS AND LIBRARIANSHIP. SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTED
FROM THESE VISITS. THEY INCLUDE' (A) THE SETTING UP OF A VERY LOW BUDGET
RESEARCH UNIT TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION; (B) FUTURE RESEARCH ON
THE BETTER PRESENTATION OF READABILITY DATA TO TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS; (C)
MORE WORK ON THE LINGUISTIC CHANGES INVOLVED IN SUMMARISING TEXT; (D) MORE
EMPHASIS ON WHAT THE READER DOES WITH INFORMATION RETRIEVED, ESPECIALLY IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES; AND (E) INVESTIGATION OF EDUCATION IN THE USE OF LITERATURE
AS ONE OF A STANDARD RANGE OF STUDY SKILLS.
PROJECTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND CRITICAL PARTICIPATION.
     
READING INTERESTS REFLECT PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IN TURN URGES ONE TO READ
WHAT COULD BE HELPFUL' CRITICAL DISTANCING, SENSITIVITY TO THE CONFLICTS OF
OTHERS, AND IDENTIFICATION WITH OPPOSITE ROLES ARE ALL VEHICLES FOR THE
PROCESS OF PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT. INVESTIGATES THE WAYS IN WHICH CHILDREN'S AND
YOUTH LIBRARIES GUIDE THE READER TO ACHIEVE CRITICAL DISTANCE.
READING AND LIBRARIES IN THE SOCIO-CULTURAL LIFE OF AN URBAN BLACK COMMUNITY.
     
TO OBTAIN A BROAD SOCIO-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE ROLE OF READING AND PUBLIC
LIBRARY USE IN AN URBAN BLACK COMMUNITY IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE READING, PUBLIC
LIBRARY USE AND COMMUNICATIONS HABITS OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 406 HOUSEHOLDS AND
OF 123 ADULT LIBRARY MEMBERS (ALL IN PRETORIA) WERE STUDIED. THE FINDINGS
INDICATE THAT THE LIFESTYLE OF THE LIBRARY USERS AS A GROUP IS SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL BLACK POPULATION AND THAT LIBRARY USERS
COMMUNICATE MORE BROADLY (THROUGH TALKING WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE
FAMILY, PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES, AND USING A VARIETY OF MEDIA).
LIBRARY SERVICES SURVEY OF EASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY EXTENSION CLASSES.
     
A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE EASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY LIBRARY TO
DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SERVICES TO THE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND
EXTENSION PROGRAMME COULD BE IMPROVED. STUDENTS AND FACULTY WERE ASKED TO RATE
SERVICES AS ADEQUATE OR INADEQUATE AND RANK POSSIBLE METHODS OF IMPROVING
SERVICES ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5. ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY AND
DESCRIBES THE WAYS IN WHICH IT WILL BE USED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES.
REMEDIATION AND REINFORCEMENT' BOOKS FOR CHILDREN WITH VISUAL PERCEPTUAL
IMPAIRMENTS.
     
STRESSES THE SPECIAL ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF LIBRARIANS IN RELATION TO
LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN AND ANALYSES SOME BOOKS WHICH CAN BE USED TO
REMEDIATE OR REINFORCE VISUAL PERCEPTUAL SKILLS.
PROFICIENCY IN READING AS A CRITERION FOR A GENERAL TYPOLOGY OF READERS.
     
SOME KIND OF CLASSIFICATION OF READERS IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMPLEX EDUCATION
OF LIBRARY USERS. MUCH PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IMPOSED TOO RIGID DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN READERS OF FICTION AND NONFICTION. A MORE RELEVANT DIVISION WOULD BE
ACCORDING TO PROFICIENCY IN DIFFERENT READING SKILLS' CHOOSING BOOKS TO READ;
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS READ; ACQUIRING AND USING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED. 6
READERSHIP GROUPS DIVIDED BY THESE CRITERIA ARE PROPOSED, RANGING FROM USERS
WITH NONE OF THESE SKILLS TO THOSE WITH A HARMONIOUSLY DEVELOPED RANGE OF
SKILLS.
A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL BASIS FOR CLASSIFYING READERS.
     
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP READING ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE ABLE
TO CATEGORISE HIS READERS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL METHOD,
CONSIDERING BOTH THE ACTUAL READING ABILITY AND MOTIVES OF THE READER.
'READING ABILITY' SHOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF' DIRECTION IN READING
(PURPOSIVENESS); ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS; AND ABILITY TO ABSORB CONCEPTUAL
CONTENT. READERS' MOTIVES ARE DIVIDED INTO' THOSE WHOSE READING IS DIRECTED
TOWARDS DEVELOPING THEIR SOCIAL AND MORAL OUTLOOK; THOSE WHO NEED HELP IN
CHOOSING A CAREER; THOSE WHO READ TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONALITY; BUT FURTHER
SUB-DIVISIONS MAY ALSO BE WORKED OUT.
THE ADVANCEMENT OF READING AT WORK.
     
THE FACTORY LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE LITERATURE FOR ALL STAFF, ESPECIALLY THE
WORKERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE READING HABITS
OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS; WORKERS PROBABLY COMPRISE MORE THAN 1/8 BUT LESS
THEN 1/2 OF A FACTORY LIBRARY'S READERS. THE FACTORY LIBRARY IS THE LIBRARY
MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE READING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES. IN FACTORY
LIBRARIES, AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THERE ARE MORE ADULT READERS THAN
TEENAGE READERS AND MORE MALE READERS THAN FEMALE. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT
ADULTS NEED TO READ MORE THAN THE YOUNG AND THAT THE WORKERS WHO DO READ, EVEN
IF ONLY LIGHT LITERATURE, WILL HAVE MORE ACTIVE AND COMMUNICATIVE
PERSONALITIES THAN NON-READERS AND MAKE A LARGER CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY.
SURVEY' READING INTERESTS OF S.4-F.2 PUPILS IN COMPOSITE SCHOOLS WITH 80-100%
MAORI POPULATION.
     
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE IN HAMILTON SERVES THE SOUTH AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND,
EDUCATION BOARD DISTRICT, WHICH HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF MAORIS. 153 MAORI
GIRLS AND 151 MAORI BOYS WERE INTERVIEWED IN OCT-NOV 79 CONCERNING THEIR
READING PREFERENCES AND HABITS. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS WHICH, ALTHOUGH
CONTAINING MANY CONTRADICTIONS, SHOWED THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THE SCHOOLS AND
THEIR LIBRARIES IN PROVIDING READING MATERIALS.
DIRECTIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK IN THE SERVICE OF COMMUNIST EDUCATION AND
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS.
     
USSR LIBRARIES HAVE REACHED A NEW STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR
EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION. THEIR AIMS NOW INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF MORE LISTS OF
RECOMMENDED READING, MORE ACTIVE PROPAGANDA OF ATHEISM, GREATER EMPHASIS BOTH
ON MORAL AND AESTHETIC EDUCATION AND ON SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION, AND THE EFFECTIVE USE OF TELEVISION AND RADIO. A SINGLE SYSTEM FOR
PROMOTING BOOKS IS REQUIRED AND LIBRARIES SHOULD FURTHER INVESTIGATE A
DIFFERENTIATED APPROACH TO READER SERVICES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A NEW
LONG-TERM EDUCATIONAL PROJECT, BASED ON COORDINATED RESEARCH.
REFLECTIONS OF TOMORROW' LIFELONG LEARNING AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY' A DELPHI
STUDY.
     
A DELPHI STUDY CONDUCTED TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN OR WILL BE
ONE OF THE NONFORMAL PROVIDERS OF LIFELONG LEARNING IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA,
AND TO FIND WAYS IN WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, AS PERCEIVED BY VARIOUS PUBLICS,
COULD BECOME AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THIS DIMENSION OF THE EDUCATIONAL
PROCESS.
THE MYTH OF BIBLIOTHERAPY.
     
OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIBLIOTHERAPY IN NON-MEDICAL AREAS AND SUGGESTS
THAT MUCH OF WHAT PASSES FOR BIBLIOTHERAPY IS THINLY DISGUISED PREACHING AIMED
AT TEACHING CHILDREN TO BEHAVE THE WAY ADULTS WANT THEM TO.
BIBLIOGRAPHY' GOOD BOOK OR MEDIA SELECTION PLUS INDIVIDUAL GUIDANCE PLUS A
DEFINITE GOAL.
     
THE REQUISITE QUALITIES AND SKILLS OF THE BIBLIOTHERAPIST ARE ANALYSED AND
BIBLIOTHERAPY IS PRESENTED AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LIBRARIAN TO INFLUENCE
SOCIAL CHANGE. THE CONCEPT IS ADDRESSED BOTH AS AN ART FORM AND AS A
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
INFORMATION SCIENCE' A BIBLIOMETRIC EVALUATION OF THE INFORMATION ANALYSIS
CONCEPT.
     
(PHD THESIS-BOSTON UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL.) EXPLORES THE POTENTIAL USES OF
CITATION ANALYSIS FOR THE DOCUMENTATION OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CONCEPT
(INFORMATION ANALYSIS), AND IN PARTICULAR THE USE OF CITATION NETWORKS TO
IDENTIFY THE CORE LITERATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KEY PARAMETERS. ONE
OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF READILY AVAILABLE COMPUTER
INDEXING PROGRAMS TO PERFORM CITATION ANALYSIS. THE STUDY IS EXPLORATORY AND
BASED ON A SMALL SAMPLE. SUGGESTS LARGE-SCALE TESTS NEED TO BE CONDUCTED USING
COMPUTER-BASED FILES AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURES.
AN EXACT FORMULATION OF BRADFORD'S LAW.
     
AN EXACT, DISCRETE FORMULATION OF BRADFORD'S LAW DESCRIBING THE DISTRIBUTION
OF ARTICLES IN JOURNALS IS DERIVED BY SHOWING THAT IT IS A SPECIAL CASE OF THE
ZIPF-MANDELBROT 'RANK FREQUENCY' LAW. A RELATIVELY SIMPLE METHOD IS PRESENTED
FOR FITTING THE MODEL TO EMPIRICAL DATA AND ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS
AND ARTICLES IN A SUBJECT COLLECTION.
DESIGN FOR AN ALTERNATIVE RURAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE.
     
(MLS THESIS). AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE ALTERNATIVE
SOCIETY AND THE DESIGN OF A PROPOSED INFORMATION SERVICE IN NORTH-EAST
SCOTLAND FOR THE BACK-TO-THE-LAND ELEMENT OF THE ALTERNATIVE SOCIETY.
A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIBRARY AT LONGLEAT HOUSE, WARMINSTER, WILTS.
     
A COPIOUSLY-ILLUSTRATED ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY AT LONGLEAT.
IT IS CLAIMED TO BE THE FINEST PRIVATE LIBRARY IN ENGLAND AND CONTAINS A FULL
SHELF OF BOOKS PRINTED BY WILLIAM CAXTON, MANUSCRIPTS OF GREAT ANTIQUITY, AND
BOOKS OF WHICH NO OTHER COPIES ARE KNOWN.
CURRENT PROBLEMS IN WORK WITH RARE EDITIONS.
     
THE PROBLEMS OF ACQUIRING AND RECORDING RARE EDITIONS, LEAVING ASIDE
PRESERVATION AND READER SERVICES, ARE MULTITUDINOUS. THERE IS NO ACCEPTED
DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A RARE BOOK' ITS AGE CAN BE EASILY DEFINED, BUT
NOT SO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS CONTENT OR PUBLICATION. CENTRAL AND REGIONAL
LIBRARIES APPLY DIFFERENT CRITERIA AND METHODS OF COLLECTION ARE HAPHAZARD.
FOLLOWING A RECENT STATEMENT BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS ON PRESERVING
CULTURAL TREASURES, LIBRARIES SHOULD REGISTER LOCAL PRIVATE COLLECTIONS OF
RARE BOOKS AND TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT THEM BEING DISSIPATED, CREATE UNION
CATALOGUES OF THEIR HOLDINGS, AND A LIST OF THE NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT
COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE COMPILED AND PUBLISHED.
THE FORMATION OF BOOK COLLECTIONS ON TERRITORIAL SUBJECTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
TERRITORIAL LITERATURE IS COLLECTED BY ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY
AND THE COOPERATION OF THE DISTRICT RESEARCH LIBRARIES IS SOUGHT IN
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND CLASSIFICATION MATTERS. TERRITORIAL SUBJECTS INCLUDE
HISTORY OF THE REGION, NATURE, CULTURAL ASPECTS, SCIENCE, INDUSTRY, LOCAL
AUTHORITIES, ADMINISTRATION AND RELIGION. SOURCES OF TERRITORIAL LITERATURE
MAY BE PUBLISHING HOUSES BUT THE MAJORITY DERIVES FROM LOCAL ORGANISATIONS AND
INSTITUTIONS. THE LITERATURE FALLS INTO 3 GROUPS' PRE 1945, POST 1945 AND NEW
PUBLICATIONS. COLLECTIONS OF TERRITORIAL LITERATURE ARE DIVIDED INTO ARCHIVE
MATERIAL FOR INTERNAL LIBRARY USE AND MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR LENDING TO THE
GENERAL PUBLIC. THESE COLLECTIONS ARE OF GREAT CULTURAL AND POLITICAL
IMPORTANCE PROVIDING A SOURCE OF HISTORICAL EDUCATION AND AN AWARENESS OF
CULTURAL HERITAGE.
THE FINNMARK LIBRARY.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON LIBRARY SERVICES IN NORDKALOTTEN, THAT PART OF
SCANDINAVIA WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. THE FINNMARK LIBRARY (IN VADSO, FINNMARK
COUNTY, NORWAY) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1892 TO COLLECT AND STORE BOOKS AND
MANUSCRIPTS CONCERNING THE COUNTY'S HISTORY, ETHNOGRAPHY, LANGUAGE, NATURAL
HISTORY, STATISTICS, AND ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION. DESCRIBES ITS FOUNDATION,
HOW ITS OBTAINED ITS OWN BUILDING IN 1926, THE COLLECTION'S GROWTH, WAR
DAMAGE, AND FINANCIAL HELP BY GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUALS. THE COLLECTION NOW
CONTAINS 7,000 BOOKS (INCLUDING SEVERAL FROM THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES),
THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS, AND MAPS.
RESOURCES FOR SOVIET, EAST EUROPEAN AND SLAVONIC STUDIES IN BRITISH LIBRARIES.
     
RECORDS LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN THE UK LIKELY TO BE OF USE FOR ADVANCED STUDY
AND RESEARCH AND DESCRIBES THEIR CONTENTS IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL FOR THE
ENQUIRER TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE BETWEEN THEM. SUBJECT COVERAGE IS ALL
AREAS OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE IS ALL
TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE USSR, POLAND, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, EAST GERMANY (SINCE
1945), HUNGARY, YUGOSLAVIA, RUMANIA, BULGARIA, AND ALBANIA. FOR EACH
COLLECTION, GIVES DETAILS OF CONTENT, ADMISSION, INTERLIBRARY LOANS,
FACILITIES, AND PUBLICATIONS.
COLLECTING CANADIANA AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO HOW MANY CANADIAN BOOKS REACH
THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND THEIR ROUTE. THE CANADIAN COLLECTION IS NOT
CATALOGUED SEPARATELY AND THE LAST STUDY OF CANADIAN HOLDINGS WAS CARRIED OUT
IN 1971. LC HOLDINGS REFLECT READER INTEREST (AND REQUESTS FROM OTHER
LIBRARIES), SO IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT THE RECENT INCREASE IN CANADIAN STUDIES
COURSES AT US UNIVERSITIES WILL AFFECT LC ACQUISITION POLICIES (AT PRESENT A
MATTER OF RANDOM SELECTION AND INTERMITTENT FUNDING).
CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN RESEARCH WORK WITH NEWSPAPER COLLECTIONS.
     
USE OF THE NEWSPAPER DEPARTMENT OF THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY HAS MORE THAN
DOUBLED OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS. IN SUCH AN EXPANDING FIELD OF LIBRARIANSHIP
THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE ESTABLISHING A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE
ORGANISATION AND USE OF NEWSPAPERS. PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH CAN BE
READILY IDENTIFIED. IN 1978 THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY ORGANISED A CONFERENCE ON
THE SUBJECT AS THE 1ST STEP IN A LONG-TERM PROGRAMME TO SET UP A
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE CENTRE FOR WORK WITH NEWSPAPER COLLECTIONS.
NEWSPAPERS ON MICROFILM' HISTORY AS IT WAS HAPPENING (AND INDEXES TO HELP YOU
FIND YOUR WAY).
     
DISCUSSES THE PRESERVATION OF NEWSPAPERS ON MICROFILM AND THEIR PLACE AS A
REFERENCE SOURCE, WITH REFERENCE TO PROCEDURES AT BELL & HOWELL'S MICRO PHOTO
DIVISION (WOOSTER, OHIO). OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF MICRO PHOTO'S NEWSPAPER
INDEXING CENTER AND GIVES A STEP-BY-STEP DESCRIPTION OF HOW A NEWSPAPER INDEX

ABACUS1 TO 2ZWEEMANN1' THE SERIALS SECTION IN ACTION.T
     
HE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) BARR SMITH LIBRARY SUBSCRIBES TO
OVER 7,200 SERIALS AND RECEIVES A FURTHER 7,700 REGULARLY AS GIFTS OR PART OF
THE EXCHANGE PROGRAMME. DESCRIBES HOW THE SERIALS ARE ARRANGED SO THAT THEY
ARE OF MAXIMUM BENEFIT TO USERS AND OUTLINES THE BINDING TASKS AND RECORDING
OF CORRESPONDENCE CONCERNING SERIALS.
THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF GREY LITERATURE.
     
THE PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH CENTRE, LEICESTER, UK, WAS COMMISSIONED TO
STUDY THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF GREY LITERATURE AND PREPARE BASIC
GUIDELINES FOR PRESENTATION IN A FORM CAPABLE OF BEING WIDELY ADVERTISED AND
USED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY. FINDINGS INDICATE CONSIDERABLE
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OFFERED BY GREY
LITERATURE; A NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE USE OF COLOUR (ESPECIALLY ON COVERS)
AND BINDING; AND A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE DESIRE FOR
GUIDELINES-DOCUMENT RETRIEVERS SEE A NEED FOR GUIDELINES, WHEREAS
REPORT-PRODUCERS SEE THE PRESENT SITUATION AS ADEQUATE AND DO NOT READILY
ACCEPT THE NOTION OF GUIDELINES.
RECORDS SYSTEMS OF THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY' CENTRAL RECORDS AND
DIRECTIVES SYSTEM RECORDS.
     
THIS REPORT RESULTS FROM THE 1ST PHASE OF A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF ALL
ARCHIVAL RECORDS SYSTEMS OF THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY. THE REPORT
DESCRIBES 2 MAJOR ARCHIVAL COLLECTIONS' THE CENTRAL RECORDS OF THE LABORATORY,
WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE RECORDS AND CORRESPONDENCE MANAGEMENT BRANCH, AND THE
RECORDS OF NRL DIRECTIVES-OFFICIAL POLICY DECLARATIONS-WHICH ARE MANAGED BY
THE ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT SECTION. THE AIM OF THE REPORT IS TO EXPLAIN
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE COLLECTIONS, HOW THEY ARE ORGANISED, AND HOW THEY MAY
BEST BE USED.
MODERN PUBLIC RECORDS' SELECTION AND ACCESS.
     
REPORT OF A COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR, CHAIRMAN SIR DUNCAN
WILSON; IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE UK PARLIAMENT BY THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR, MAR
81. CONSIDERS THE KEEPING OF PUBLIC RECORDS, PRESERVATION, AND ACCESS,
PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT, AND THE SITUATION REGARDING
AUDIO-VISUAL AND MACHINE-READABLE RECORDS. CONCLUDES THAT THE SYSTEM MAPPED
OUT BY THE EARLIER GRIGG REPORT IS GOOD IN ITSELF AND CAPABLE OF ADAPTATION TO
CHANGING NEEDS AND CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, BUT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED NEITHER IN
SPIRIT NOR IN LETTER. THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS ON THIS
DEFICIENCY.
THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE AND ITS MEANS OF REFERENCE.
     
SUMMARY OF A TALK GIVEN TO THE SOCIETY OF INDEXERS, 12 FEB 80. OUTLINES THE
HISTORY OF THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE (PRO) WHICH HOLDS THE UK NATIONAL
ARCHIVES. GIVES SOME BRIEF INFORMATION ON THE INDEXES USED BY THE PRO, AND
DESCRIBES THE STAGES INVOLVED IN SEARCHING ITS RECORDS.
CITATION RATES TO TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PATENTS.
     
THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF
CITATIONS RECEIVED BY ISSUED US PATENTS FROM SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED US PATENTS IS
HIGHER FOR PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAN FOR A
GROUP OF RANDOMLY SELECTED PATENTS. ANALYSIS OF EXAMINERS' CITATIONS TO 100
SELECTED PATENTS SHOWED THAT THESE SELECTED PATENTS, WHICH UNDERLAY
TECHNICALLY IMPORTANT PRODUCTS, WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS FREQUENTLY CITED AS A
RANDOMLY SELECTED SET OF 102 CONTROL PATENTS. THIS FINDING PROVIDES STRONG
EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PATENT CITATION DATA CAN BE USED IN
TECHNOLOGICAL INDICATORS DEVELOPMENT, AND IN TECHNOLOGICAL POLICY ANALYSIS,
SINCE IT IMPLIES THAT THE LOCATION AND ANALYSIS OF GROUPS OF HIGHLY CITED
PATENTS CAN PROVIDE A VALID INDICATOR OF PATENT AREAS OF TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE.
WARGAMES' A MODEST DEFENSE OF SOME BLOODY DOINGS.
     
STRESSES THE GREAT EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF WARGAMES AND ADVOCATES THEIR PRESENCE
IN MEDIA CENTRES AND LIBRARIES. GIVE TITLES OF BASIC WARGAMES LITERATURE AND
MAGAZINES; DISCUSSES HOW TO START A COLLECTION; AND SUGGESTS ITS SCOPE. A
SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION WILL BECOME THE CENTRE OF A SUBCULTURE, WITH ITS OWN
ORGANISATION, CONVENTIONS, AND AMATEUR PUBLICATIONS. A WARGAMES PROGRAMME
COULD INCORPORATE RELATED MATERIAL SUCH AS HISTORIES, BIOGRAPHIES, AND
HISTORICAL NOVELS AND FILMS.
THE BROWNLESS AV CENTRE' THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION.
     
THIS EVALUATIVE STUDY REPORTS ON THE 1ST YEAR OF OPERATION OF THE AUDIOVISUAL
RESOURCES CENTRE IN THE BROWNLESS MEDICAL LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MELBOURNE. DURING A REPRESENTATIVE WEEK IN EACH OF 3 TERMS IN 1978, EVERY USER
OF THE CENTRE WAS REQUESTED TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE QUESTIONNAIRE. IN
ADDITION, A STAFF QUESTIONNAIRE WAS MAILED TO ALL MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL STAFF
OF THE UNIVERSITY. THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF USE OF THE CENTRE WERE EXPLORED IN
DEPTH, AS WELL AS THE RELEVANCE AND ADEQUACY OF THE PROGRAMME WITH RESPECT TO
BOTH THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF STAFF AND STUDENTS. THE REPORT ANALYSES THE
DEVELOPMENTS TO DATE AND INDICATES WAYS IN WHICH THE FACILITY CAN BECOME AN
EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE LEARNING RESOURCE IN THE FUTURE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.

HANDLING MAP COLLECTIONS IN GEOLOGICAL LIBRARIES' ADVICE FROM MAP EXPERTS.
     
REPORT OF THE SESSION 'INTEGRATING AN UNPROCESSED DEPARTMENTAL GEOLOGIC MAP
COLLECTION' THE MAP EXPERTS OFFER ADVICE' AT THE WESTERN ASSOCIATION OF MAP
LIBRARIES MEETING, SALT LAKE CITY, OCT 80. A 3-STRONG PANEL WERE PRESENTED
WITH THE CASE HISTORY OF THE WILLIAM C. PUTNAM GEOLOGIC MAP LIBRARY MAINTAINED
BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF EARTH AND SPACE
SCIENCES AND SUPERVISED (FOR A TRIAL PERIOD) BY THE GEOLOGY-GEOPHYSICS
LIBRARY. ACCESS, CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION, CIRCULATION, COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT, SPACE, SECURITY, PRESERVATION, AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE WERE
DISCUSSED. SUGGESTIONS FROM THE PANEL AND AUDIENCE SPECIFIC TO THE PUTNAM
LIBRARY ARE TO BE INCORPORATED IN A REPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTAL AND
LIBRARY ADMINISTRATIONS. GENERAL SUGGESTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIMILAR COLLECTIONS
ELSEWHERE ARE PRESENTED HERE.
MICROCARTOGRAPHY.
     
DISCUSSES THE MICROCARTOGRAPHY SYSTEMS NOW AVAILABLE, READERS, AND COSTS.
CONCLUDES THAT SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES AND EACH MAP LIBRARY HAS
UNIQUE NEEDS, EACH LIBRARY MUST WORK OUT ITS OWN 'BEST' SYSTEM.
THE VISUAL IMAGE' ITS IMMEDIACY AND TRADITION.
     
THE HILL MONASTIC MANUSCRIPT MICROFILM LIBRARY, SAINT JOHN'S UNIVERSITY,
MINNESOTA, WAS FOUNDED IN 1964, AND HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN MICROFILMING THE
ENTIRE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS STILL EXTANT IN EUROPEAN MONASTIC AND ALLIED
LIBRARIES. DESCRIBES THE PROJECT, CATALOGUING PRACTICE, AND INCLUDES EXAMPLES
OF MAIN CATALOGUE ENTRIES.
MICROFICHE AS A VEHICLE FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS.
     
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE IS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF
IMPROVING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR INFORMATION DISSEMINATION PROGRAMME
BY MAKING A LARGER PART OF THE DISSEMINATION IN MICROFICHE INSTEAD OF PAPER
COPY. THEY COMMISSIONED THIS STUDY ON AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT TO HELP THEM
DECIDE WHETHER MICROFICHE DISSEMINATION WOULD HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT. THE
REPORT CONCLUDES THAT, AS PRESENTLY USED, MOST OF THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROFICHE
ACCRUE TO THE PRODUCER, AND MOST OF THE DISADVANTAGES TO THE USER. THERE IS
LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE TO BROADENING THE USE OF FICHE FOR THE
INTENDED AUDIENCE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS. SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES ARE
PRESENTED FOR LESSENING THIS PROBLEM, INCLUDING EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF
LIBRARIES, PROMOTING THE AVAILABILITY OF FICHE-TO-PAPER COPIERS, AND USING
MICROFICHE ITSELF IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FACILITATE INFORMATION TRANSFER,
RATHER THAN AS AN ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE FEATURES O F A PAPER PUBLICATION IN
A REDUCED SIZE.
CASSETTES-A MEANINGFUL COMPLEMENT TO THE BOOK.
     
IF LIBRARIES STOCK CASSETTES, NEW READERS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE LIBRARY AND
LOAN FIGURES RISE. CASSETTES SHOULD BE PLACED WITH OR NEAR BOOKS ON THE SAME
SUBJECT; THEY SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS BOOKS AND ENTERED IN THE
MAIN CATALOGUE. MUSIC CASSETTES ARE AN EXCELLENT COMPLEMENT TO MUSIC
LITERATURE AND CAN STIMULATE PEOPLE TO READ BOOKS ABOUT MUSIC. CASSETTES FOR
CHILDREN MAY ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO READ WHO ARE NOT YET KEEN READERS; GOOD
QUALITY CASSETTES MUST BE SELECTED SINCE THERE IS A WIDE RANGE ON THE MARKET
IN THIS FIELD. LANGUAGE CASSETTES SHOULD BE ARRANGED ON BOOKSHELVES WITH THEIR
ACCOMPANYING TEXTBOOKS. LITERATURE CASSETTES ARE USEFUL FOR READERS WITH POOR
SIGHT, SO THEY SHOULD BE PLACED NEAR THE LARGE PRINT BOOKS; THEY ARE ALSO
HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH READING DIFFICULTIES AND FOR GROUP LISTENING AND
DISCUSSION.
INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CORRELATES OF RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION
PRODUCTIVITY AMONG AMERICAN ARL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANS.
     
(PHD THESIS-OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY.) AMONGST THE CRITERIA PROPOSED BY THE
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND THE ALA IN 1971 FOR
UTILISATION WHEN ASSESSING ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS' PERFORMANCE IN TENURE AND
PROMOTION REVIEWS, WERE COMMENTS ON SCHOLARLY ABILITY AS EVIDENCED BY THE
EXECUTION OF SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH IN LIBRARIANSHIP OR BY PUBLICATION. ASSESSES
WHICH ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY MET THIS RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION
REQUIREMENT; WHETHER EDUCATIONAL, OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANISATIONAL FACTORS
AFFECT THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF PUBLICATION AND RESEARCH; AND WHETHER THERE
ARE PROFILES OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH
DISTINGUISH RESEARCHERS/PUBLISHERS AND NON-RESEARCHERS/PUBLISHERS.

PUBLICATIONS BY LANGUAGE AND COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS ALSO ANALYSED. EMPHASISES
THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMPT ABSTRACTING OF PUBLICATIONS AND PROPOSES A
QUANTITATIVE CRITERION TO MEASURE THE SPEED WITH WHICH ABSTRACTS ARE
PUBLISHED. CONCLUDES THAT DOCUMENT FLOW IN ASTRONOMY IS TYPICAL OF THAT OF
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCES.
INFORMATION FLOW DYNAMICS ANALYSIS AS A METHOD OF STUDYING DEVELOPMENT OF
ASTRONOMY AND ITS SECTIONS.
     
INVESTIGATES THE CHARACTER OF CHANGE IN DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION FLOWS IN
ASTRONOMY DURING THE PERIOD 1899-1975, USING DATA OBTAINED BY ANALYSING

THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.
     
SOME RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO REVIEWS AND REVIEW ISSUES ON PHYSICS ARE
SUMMARISED AND THE ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF THE REVIEW LITERATURE IS ANALYSED.
THE PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFYING REVIEWS ARE DISCUSSED AND A DIFFERENTIATED
APPROACH TO THE REVIEW INFORMATION SYSTEM IN PHYSICS IS OUTLINED. POSSIBLE
EVALUATION CRITERIA ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT CITATION ANALYSIS AND
QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION METHODS ARE LOSING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS AREA.
THE NEW FORM OF AN INFORMATION PUBLICATION AT THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.
     
DISCUSSES THE CONTENTS AND FORMAT OF A NEW ISSUE OF 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS

ANNOTATIONS.
READING RUSSIAN LITERATURE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT.
     
TRADITIONALLY RUSSIAN LITERATURE HAS TACKLED THE PROBLEMS OF MINORITY
NATIONALITIES, WHILE ITS WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION HAS HELPED BOND THOSE
PEOPLES TOGETHER. A RESEARCH PROJECT TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF RUSSIAN
LITERATURE TODAY ON NON-RUSSIAN PEOPLES WITHIN THE USSR WAS RECENTLY
UNDERTAKEN BY THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY. THE PROJECT CONSIDERED THE AVAILABILITY
OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT WAS READ AND THE VALUE
ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH READING. THE PROJECT IS INTENDED TO RECOMMEND TO LIBRARIES
LEVELS OF PROVISION AND METHODS OF PROMOTING SUCH LITERATURE, AND THE RESEARCH
METHODS USED WILL PROVIDE A FORMAT FOR FUTURE PROJECTS.

LIBRARIES, AND ADMINISTRATION AND CLASSES OF LSCA FUNDS.
THE ORGANISATION AND METHODS OF PLANNING RESEARCH WORK IN THE M.E.
SALTYKOV-SHCHEDRIN STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
ADEQUATE PLANNING IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE OF ALL RESEARCH WORK. PLANNING
FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH FOLLOWS THE SAME GUIDELINES AS OTHER GOVERNMENT PLANNING,
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POLITICAL COMMITMENT, RELEVANCE, CONTINUITY AND
PURPOSIVENESS. 1ST, A LIST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OVER THE NEXT 20
YEARS IS DRAWN UP; THEN A 5-YEAR PLAN IS WORKED OUT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MOST
IMMEDIATE OF THESE PROBLEMS; THEN A YEARLY PLAN IS DRAWN UP TO IMPLEMENT THE
5-YEAR PLAN. EXAMPLES OF SUCH A PROGRAMME IN OPERATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE
RESEARCH WORK OF THE SALTYKOV-SHCHEDRIN STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
THE ENVIRONMENT FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE 1980S.
     
EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING NOW AND IN THE 1980S WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL
IMPACT ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR OPERATIONS. EFFECTIVE PLANNING DEPENDS ON
KNOWLEDGE OF LIKELY EVENTS AND TRENDS AND ON THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FACTORS
INTO THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE LIBRARY. THE SIGNIFICANT DEMOGRAPHIC,
POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AFFECTING LIBRARIES ARE
REVIEWED. WHILE THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUGGESTED, THEY DO NOT
APPLY UNIFORMLY TO ALL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIANS MUST SELECT THE FACTORS
SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR LIBRARY AND PLAN WITHIN ITS SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT.
THE ENFORCED RE-ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES.
     
(FLA THESIS). CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AS PART OF A PROFIT-MOTIVATED
ORGANISATION, PROVIDING A LITERATURE AND INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE BENEFIT
OF ITS PARENT COMPANY. THE SERVICE PROVIDED MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO THE
MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY. AS PART OF THE ORGANISATION
THE LIBRARY IS SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT CONTROL IN THE SAME WAY AS ANY OTHER PART
OF THE ORGANISATION. MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, MADE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THAN THE
LIBRARY, AFFECT THE LIBRARY'S OPERATION AND ITS FUNCTIONS AND STAFF. THE
EFFECT OF THESE DECISIONS ON THE LIBRARY ARE EXAMINED IN A NUMBER OF CASES
WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE POLICY DECISIONS TAKEN BY FERRANTI LTD IN
1975, AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE COMPANY LIBRARIES.
COOPERATION AMONG SPECIAL LIBRARIES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
     
AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, SPECIAL QUESTIONS ARISE REGARDING DIRECT AND
INDIRECT COOPERATION AMONG SPECIAL LIBRARIES. AS EXAMPLES OF THE POSSIBILITIES
FOR EFFECTIVE COOPERATION, INCLUDING BILATERAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN OFFICIAL AND
UNOFFICIAL BODIES, AN OVERVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARY SITUATION IN
GERMANY AND BRAZIL. THE PRIORITIES FOR SUPPLYING LITERATURE IN SPECIALISED
FIELDS AND FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ARE CONSIDERED. IN ADDITION, THE
ACTIVITIES AND WORKING METHODS OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND THEIR ECONOMIC ASPECTS
ARE SURVEYED TRACING THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND ITS USE. CONSIDERATION IS
ALSO GIVEN TO THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOPERATION AMONG
SPECIAL LIBRARIES.
LIBRARY COOPERATION' SITUATION IN JORDAN (IN ARABIC).
     
DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY COOPERATION INCLUDING; PURCHASE,
EXCHANGE, CATALOGUING, INTERLIBRARY LOAN, REFERENCE AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES
AND STORAGE. THE BENEFITS OF ALL THESE ASPECTS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO
THE JORDANIAN MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIBRARIES,
MUNICIPALITY PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES ENTERING THE 1980'S.
     
EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF SYSTEM ORGANISATION FROM THE
VIEWPOINT OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES PROVIDES A PERSPECTIVE ON THE GROWTH OF LIBRARY
NETWORKS, THEIR ADMINISTRATION, AND THE PRESSURES THAT OPPOSED THEIR
DEVELOPMENT IN THE 70S. IDENTIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT, AND LOOKS AT THE NEED FOR NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE
EFFECTIVE MARKETING FOR THE 80S. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE STRUCTURE OF ROMAN CATHOLIC LIBRARY WORK (III AND IV).
     
MOST WEST GERMANY DIOCESES HAVE A LIBRARY CENTRE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ROMAN
CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITHIN THE DIOCESE. LIBRARY CENTRES WERE DEVELOPED
AFTER WORLD WAR 2 FROM THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION'S DIOCESAN CENTRES. A LIBRARY
CENTRE'S TASKS INCLUDE' PROVIDING ADVICE AND PRACTICAL HELP FOR LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT; PROVIDING HELP WITH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS; ORGANISING BASIC AND
ADVANCED TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL AND NON-PROFESSIONAL STAFF; ADMINISTERING
CHURCH AND PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THE LIBRARIES; REPRESENTING CHURCH LIBRARY
INTERESTS WITHIN RELIGIOUS AND PUBLIC SPHERES; PROVIDING THEOLOGICAL MATERIAL
AND ESTABLISHING THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. A STATE WORKING PARTY
ORGANISES THE COOPERATION OF ALL LIBRARY CENTRES WITHIN A FEDERAL STATE,
ACTING AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE BODY AND AS A FORUM FOR THE EXCHANGE OF
EXPERIENCE. FOR PARTS 1 AND 2, 2SEE1 80/3571 AND 81/289 RESPECTIVELY.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UP
REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES.
     
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UP
REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES WERE PUT FORWARD BY THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON DATA
PROCESSING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE OF THE GERMAN RESEARCH
SOCIETY (DEUTCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT). THEY UNDERLINE HOW NECESSARY AND
URGENT IT IS TO BUILD UP REGIONAL DATA PROCESSING NETWORKS FOR COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING IN LIBRARIES. REGIONAL NETWORKS PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL MEANS OF
RATIONALISING LIBRARY WORK. THESE NETWORKS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED IN ALL 11
FEDERAL STATES BUT SHOULD BE BUILT UP ON THE EXISTING 7 LENDING SYSTEM
REGIONS; THEY WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED IN A NATIONAL NETWORK. REGIONAL LIBRARY
CENTRES WOULD FORM THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL
TASK AREAS' CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION, CENTRAL EDITING OF CATALOGUES ETC.,
DATA EXCHANGE WITH OTHER CENTRAL INSTITUTES AND NETWORKS, SUPPLYING ORDERED
BOO KS WITHIN THE PLANNED NATIONAL ORDER SYSTEM, DEVELOPING SYSTEMS AND
PROGRAMMES FOR THE SOFTWARE OF THE REGIONAL NETWORK, AND PLANNING AND
COORDINATION.
DO LIBRARIES HAVE POLITICAL DUTIES?.
     
MANY TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE POLITICAL, NOT BECAUSE THEY
PROMOTE PARTY POLITICS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ENLIGHTENMENT AND PLEASURE FOR
EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A FREE DEMOCRACY. CULTURE INVOLVES NOT ONLY BEAUTY BUT ALSO
SOCIAL REALITY. LIBRARIANS MUST HELP ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; GERMANY IS AHEAD
OF FRANCE IN LIBRARY WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND PROVISION OF
LIBRARY FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS CERTAINLY INVOLVES BOTH CULTURE AND
POLITICS. THE LIBRARIES MUST PROMOTE READING, OR BOOKS MAY BE OUSTED BY
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA MUST BE THOSE OF TRUTH AND
OBJECTIVITY; THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE MINDFUL OF ALL VIEWPOINTS, SINCE FREEDOM
PERMITS OPPOSITION.
PUBLIC RELATIONS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
CHALLENGES THE POPULARLY HELD BELIEF THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS A CAPTIVE
AUDIENCE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRES LITTLE OR NO PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME.
ARGUES THAT THE USE OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY BY STAFF AND STUDENTS MUST NOT BE
TAKEN FOR GRANTED, AND THAT DETAILED GUIDANCE IN THE USE OF THE LIBRARY SHOULD
BE GIVEN TO POSTGRADUATES AND UNDERGRADUATES. OFFERS SOME ADVICE ON THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF A SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME, AND SUGGESTS THE
DESIGNATION OF A LIBRARIAN AS A PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER.
SELLING THE BUSINESS LIBRARY.
     
IN TODAY'S COST-CONSCIOUS ECONOMY, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SPECIAL LIBRARY
HAS A WELL-DEFINED PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMME. PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES AND
PROBLEMS OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARY IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ARE CONSIDERED. THE
AUDIENCES SERVED ARE IDENTIFIED, AND SOME OF THE ACTIVE MEANS BY WHICH
BUSINESS LIBRARIES CAN SUCCESSFULLY SELL THEIR SERVICES ARE OUTLINED.
THE NATIONAL PLANNING FOR LIBRARIES, DOCUMENTATION ARCHIVES AND INFORMATION
SERVICES WITH REFERENCE TO GENERAL INFORMATION PROGRAMME FOR BOTSWANA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTING LIBRARY,
DOCUMENTATION, AND ARCHIVES SERVICES IN BOTSWANA, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL
SERVICES, PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, AND THE GENERAL INFORMATION
PROGRAMME AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTSWANA. CONCLUDES THAT WHILST THERE HAVE
BEEN SOME ACHIEVEMENTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EXISTING SERVICES BE IMPROVED.
THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE REASSESSED AND DEVELOPED IN
ORDER TO COPE WITH THE PRESENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEMANDS. HOPES
THAT THE NECESSARY BOLD STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO DEVELOP A FULLY INTEGRATED AND
EFFECTIVE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC ('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LIBRARIES AFTER THE NEW
POLYTECHNIC (UNIVERSITY) LAWS.
     
IN 1979 NEW UNIVERSITY LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH AFFECTED POLYTECHNIC
('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LAWS AND THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.
ALTHOUGH POLYTECHNICS DIFFER IN FORM SLIGHTLY FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WITHIN
WEST GERMANY, THERE ARE SOME GENERAL POINTS IN THE NEW LAWS WHICH INFLUENCE
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE SAME WAY. THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARIES HAS BECOME
MORE PRECISE; THEY ARE RECOGNISED AS CENTRAL WORKING UNITS. THE LIBRARIES NOW
HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND THE
ALLOCATION OF NEW STAFF. THE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY HAS THUS BECOME AN
INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION WITH ITS OWN DUTIES AND RIGHTS WITHIN THE POLYTECHNIC.
HOWEVER, LIBRARIES STILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF ALLOCATIONS FROM THE CENTRAL
POLYTECHNIC BODIES. FINAL DECISIONS ON THE CHOICE OF LITERATURE ACQUISITION
CAN STILL ONLY BE MADE BY THE RELEVANT POLYTECHNIC DEPARTMENT WITH THE LI
BRARY MERELY ACTING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.
HOW CAN LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS BE MEASURED?.
     
EXAMINES THE LIBRARY LITERATURE WHICH DEALS WITH MEASUREMENT OF LIBRARY
EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS USUALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF LOAN FIGURES, BUT THIS
METHOD FAILS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF REFERENCE AND INFORMATION WORK, NOW OF GROWING
IMPORTANCE. EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE SEEN IN RELATION TO THE LIBRARY'S AIMS. A
MANUAL FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS PUBLISHED IN 1976 BY
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE LIBRARIES WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTE
MATERIALS TO CREATE DEMANDS, HAMBURG ET AL (1972) SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING TESTS
FOR EFFECTIVENESS' EXPOSURE COUNTS, ITEM USE-DAYS, EXPOSURE TIME. GORE (1978)
USES THE HOLDINGS RATE, AVAILABILITY RATE, AND PERFORMANCE RATE, THE LATTER
MEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHEN WANTED BY USER.
IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE EFFECTIVENESS IS A COMPOSITE CONCEPT ITS
MEASUREMENT IS COMPLEX, BUT THAT RELYING ON LOAN FIGURES ONLY IS NO LONGER
NECESSARY.
LIBRARY DATA, STATISTICS AND INFORMATION' PROGRESS TOWARD COMPARABILITY.
     
LIBRARIES OF ALL KINDS AND SIZES ARE INCREASINGLY BOUND BY COMMON NEEDS AND
CONCERNS. THIS SYMBIOSIS HAS PLACED NEW DEMANDS UPON THE COMMUNITY. PRIMARY
AMONG THESE IS THE DEMAND FOR COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS AND A LANGUAGE IN WHICH TO
SHARE THESE UNDERSTANDINGS. ONE AVENUE TO SUCH AN OBJECTIVE IS OUTLINED.
FOREMOST TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IS A FRAMEWORK OF INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARIES. A
METHOD BY WHICH TO CATALOGUE THE IMPRESSIONS OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOUR AND FROM
WHICH TO MOVE TO SOME EMPIRICALLY BASED AND SOUND THEORY OF LIBRARY BEHAVIOUR
IS DESCRIBED.
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
     
COMPRISES THE FORMAL PAPERS PRESENTED DURING 5 WORKSHOPS SPONSORED BY THE US
SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION (SLA) LIBRARY MANAGEMENT DIVISION, COSPONSORED
BY THE BUSINESS AND FINANCE, INSURANCE, AND MILITARY LIBRARIANS DIVISIONS, AND
HELD DURING THE SLA'S 70TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE, HONOLULU, HAWAII, 7-14 JUNE 79.
THE WORKSHOPS CONSIDERED 5 ASPECTS OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT' JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS; COST RECOVERY AS A
SOURCE OF LIBRARY FUNDING; CAREER PATHS FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANS; AND
COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN THE SPECIAL LIBRARY.
REGIONAL PROBLEMS IN LIBRARIANSHIP' A STATEMENT OF THE SITUATION.
     
BASIC PROBLEMS IN REGIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND USED AS
SUBJECTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THEY INCLUDE' (1) REGIONAL PECULIARITIES
REGARDING THE DISPERSAL AND USAGE OF LIBRARY RESOURCES; (2) THE NEED FOR MORE
RATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISIONS BETWEEN LIBRARY SYSTEMS; (3) THE FORMATION OF
COORDINATED PROGRAMMES AND AIMS FOR SUCH GEOGRAPHICALLY-BASED SYSTEMS; (4) THE
NEED FOR LEVELLING-UP STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE WITHIN THE DIFFERENT
REGIONS; (5) THE NEED TO INCREASE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY GENERALLY.
CONSIDERATION OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT.
NOW THAT I'M IN CHARGE, WHAT DO I DO?'' SIX RULES ABOUT RUNNING A SPECIAL
LIBRARY FOR THE NEW LIBRARY MANAGER.M
     
UCH ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED WHEN WORKING IN
A COMPANY LIBRARY. BUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR
MANAGING ONE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT INFORMATION AGE, ARE LESS
FREQUENTLY EXAMINED. 6 BASIC PRINCIPLES THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHEN
MANAGING A COMPANY LIBRARY ARE DISCUSSED.
SCHOOL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
PREPARED FOR SUBMISSION TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO
ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A COHESIVE
STATEMENT ON THE ROLE, FUNCTION, AND STAFFING OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES. FOCUSES ON
POLICY ISSUES IN THE AREA OF SCHOOL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF 3
TIERS-THE SCHOOL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL, AND CENTRAL SUPPORT SERVICES.
DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES FOR INFORMATION MANAGERS.
     
HARRISON'S MODEL OF GROUP DECISION MAKING IS DESCRIBED AND DISCUSSED IN TERMS
OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DECISIONS LIBRARIANS AND OTHER INFORMATION
MANAGERS ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE. ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO QUESTIONS OF DECISION
QUALITY AND TO FACTORS, SUCH AS GROUP SIZE, REWARD AND PENALTY MECHANISMS, AND
GROUP NORMS, WHICH AFFECT DECISION MAKING WITHIN GROUPS. INFORMATION MANAGERS
HAVE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO GROUP DECISION MAKING'
IMPROVING THEIR OWN GROUP DECISION-MAKING SKILLS AND PROCESSES, REMOVING
BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE GROUP DECISION MAKING, BROADENING THE INFORMATION
RESOURCE BASE THEY AND THEIR CLIENTS USE IN DECISION MAKING, DESIGNING
INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE DECISION MAKING, AND RAISING THE VISIBILITY
OF THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCES AS CONTRIBUTING DISCIPLINES TO THE
DECISION SCIENCES.
DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.
     
THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH IN LIBRARIES
IS REVIEWED. THE CONCEPT OF A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS) IS INTRODUCED. DSS
CAN BE VIEWED AS A SYNTHESIS OF THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS
TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN MANAGERIAL DECISION-MAKING SITUATIONS. AN EXAMPLE OF A
DSS APPLICATION FOR A MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARY IS DESCRIBED.
ARE SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES THE MODERN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR EVERYONE?.
     
LECTURE GIVEN IN BONN TO A STUDY GROUP FOR ARCHIVES, LIBRARIES AND
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES (N.D.)THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION PROGRAMME HAS AS ITS FOCAL POINT THE FOUNDATION OF 16
CENTRALISED SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES BETWEEN 1974 AND 1977. THIS INITIAL
STAGE IS NOT YET COMPLETED OWING TO LACK OF FUNDS; ONLY 3 CENTRES ARE FULLY
OPERATIONAL. THE ADEQUACY OF THESE CENTRES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED, ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS ON CENTRALISATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF MARKET
ECONOMY PRINCIPLES; INFORMATION STORED MIGHT BE SELECTED MAINLY TO SUIT
INDUSTRY. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHETHER LIBRARIES MUST CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS COSTS,
WHICH WILL BE EXPENSIVE. TRADE UNIONISTS FEAR THAT THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IN
THE CENTRES WILL RESULT IN STAFF STRESS AND THAT CENTRALISATION WILL REDUCE
EMPLOYMENT.
IMPROVING THE SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE.
     
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP. THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF THIS GUIDANCE CAN BE TRACED
BACK TO THE 1920S. TODAY IT HAS REACHED A HIGHER LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY IN ACTING
THROUGH THE CENTRALISED LIBRARY NETWORKS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE USSR. THE WAYS
IN WHICH THE LIBRARY SERVING AS THE GUIDANCE CENTRE WITHIN A NETWORK CAN
INFLUENCE THE WORK OF ITS DEPENDENT LIBRARIES CAN BE CLEARLY DEFINED, AND
ILLUSTRATED IN TABULAR FORM, BUT THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR MORE COOPERATION
AND BETTER TRAINING FOR STAFF WORKING IN THESE CENTRES.
PARTY-IN-POWER AS A DETERMINANT OF STATE AID TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
THIS STUDY MEASURES CHANGES OVER NEARLY 30 YEARS IN THE AMOUNT OF AID PROVIDED
BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE CHANGES
TO THE PARTY IN POWER. AID IS EXAMINED AT 2 LEVELS' THE 1ST VIEWS THE PARTY IN
POWER AT THE INCEPTION OF STATE AID, THE 2ND NOTES THE PARTY WHEN A
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IS MADE IN AID LEVELS. NEITHER CONDITION PRODUCES A
DEFINITIVE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PARTY IN POWER AS DEFINED BY THE STUDY, AND
PROGRESS IN AID SEEMS NEARLY EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE ASCENDANT PARTIES, OR
AT LEAST IN PROPORTION TO THE DOMINANT PARTY ACROSS THE USA AT THE TIME.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SAVE! THAT MEANS AGAIN FEWER BOOKS.
     
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE HAS EXAMINED PUBLIC LIBRARY ACCOUNTS FOR 1981. THESE
SHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE WELL WITHIN THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR'S LIMIT OF 2% REAL
GROWTH. BECAUSE OF BOOK PRICE RISES, ACQUISITIONS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW AN
OVERALL FALL OF 4%. THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR URGED LIBRARIES TO SPEND NOT MORE
THAN 185 KR. PER INHABITANT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECT THIS
STATEMENT HAS HAD, BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST SPENDERS,
ALL IN THE COPENHAGEN AREA, HAVE CUT DOWN MOST. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
PART-TIME LIBRARIES SHOW LARGER PERCENTAGE INCREASES THAN FULL-TIME LIBRARIES.
ONLY THE SOUTHERN JUTLAND REGION SHOW A CONSIDERABLE REAL INCREASE IN
EXPENDITURE ON MATERIALS. AS STAFF SALARIES ARE SUBJECT TO TOPPING UP IF
NECESSARY, THESE DO NOT SUFFER AS MUCH FROM CUTS AS MATERIAL EXPENDITURE, AND
THE PROSPECT IS ONE OF LIBRARIES WITH OUTDATED AND WORN BOOKS.
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THREE MAJOR MODELS MOST FREQUENTLY USED IN APPLYING
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN THE SOUTHEAST.
     
(PHD THESIS-GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS). SURVEYS THE USE MADE OF THE
3 MAJOR MODELS MOST FREQUENTLY USED IN APPLYING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN COLLEGE
AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES-NETWORKING, SELF-CONTAINED COMPUTER SYSTEMS, AND A
COMBINATION OF THE 2. IDENTIFIES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST
USA AND PRESENTS A SERIES OF RECOGNISED OR ASSUMED SERVICE AND OPERATION
REQUIREMENTS, SURVEYS MAJOR TECHNOLGIES APPLICABLE TO THESE LIBRARIES AND

AUTOMATING A LIBRARY' AN INVESTIGATIVE STUDY.
     
DESCRIBES HOW LIBRARIANS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA REVIEWED THE STATE OF
THE ART OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR LIBRARIES, EVALUATED CURRENT SOPHISTICATED
AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMMES, CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH SYSTEMS FOR
CLOSING THE CARD CATALOGUE, AND ASSESSED THE IMPACT WHICH THE TOTAL SYSTEM
WOULD HAVE ON THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES AT WROCLAW POLYTECHNIC.
     
WROCLAW POLYTECHNIC'S AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES
(AUTOMATYCZNE PRZETWARZANIE INFORMACJI NAUKOWEJ-APIN) IS AIMED AT THE

SERVICE AUTOMATION. DESCRIBES APIN'S SDI, RESEARCH RESULTS INFORMATION, SIGNAL
INFORMATION, CATALOGUING, AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
STAFFING FOR READER SERVICES IN POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION). 5 UK POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES (AT MANCHESTER, OXFORD,
HATFIELD, TRENT, AND COVENTRY (LANCHESTER)) WERE SURVEYED WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE INFLUENCE OF MULTI-SITE OPERATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
READER SERVICES. THE LIBRARIES PLACED MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF SUBJECT
SPECIALISTS IN MAINTAINING GOOD USER RELATIONS. ALL FOUND IT EASIER TO BUILD
UP SUCH RELATIONS IN SMALLSITE RATHER THAN LARGE CENTRAL LIBRARIES. OPINIONS
AND POLICIES CONCERNING SUBJECT SPECIALIST DUTIES VARIED. ALTERNATIVES TO
SUBJECT SPECIALIST SYSTEMS WERE NOT FAVOURED. FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS WERE
HAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE EFFORTS OF POLYTECHNICS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR
WORK ON 1 CAMPUS.
THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION/INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION SCIENTISTS SPECIAL LIBRARIES
AND INFORMATION UNITS STAFFING SURVEY 1980.
     
THE INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION SCIENTISTS (IIS) AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (LA)
CONDUCTED A JOINT STAFFING AND SALARIES SURVEY IN 1980. THIS REPLACED THE IIS
ANNUAL REMUNERATION SURVEY AND WAS PART OF THE LA'S PROGRAMME OF SUCH STUDIES.
117 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED, EACH REPRESENTING A SPECIAL LIBRARY OR
INFORMATION UNIT IN THE UK. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY ARE REPORTED BRIEFLY.
ARL ANNUAL SALARY SURVEY, 1978-1979.

RATING THE LIBRARY DIRECTOR'S JOB PERFORMANCE.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS MAILED TO A CROSS-SECTION OF LIBRARIANS THROUGHOUT THE USA
REQUESTING INFORMATION AND OPINIONS ON THEIR LIBRARY DIRECTOR'S ADMINISTRATIVE
ABILITIES, STRENGTHS, AND WEAKNESSES AND STAFF RELATIONS. 59% OF RESPONDENTS
THOUGHT THEIR DIRECTOR WAS DOING A GOOD JOB AND SHOULD BE RETAINED; 33% FELT
THE OPPOSITE; AND THE REMAINDER COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR DIRECTOR
SHOULD BE KEPT. QUOTES FROM THE RESPONDENTS TO IDENTIFY THE PERSONAL HABITS
AND MANAGEMENT STYLES THAT MAKE A GOOD/BAD LIBRARY DIRECTOR AND PRESENTS THE
10 COMMANDMENTS OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
THE ROLE OF THE SUBJECT SPECIALIST IN ANGLO-SAXON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
THIS DISSERTATION, PRESENTED BY A FRENCH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIAN IN 1979,
EXAMINES 8 ARTICLES ON SUBJECT SPECIALISTS BY UK AND US LIBRARIANS PUBLISHED
BETWEEN 1967 AND 1977, SOME DEBATING THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES AND THEIR
IMPLEMENTATION, AND SOME REPORTING ACTUAL EXPERIENCES. SYNTHESISES THE MAIN
POINTS OF DISCUSSION IN 4 SECTIONS, COVERING' THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF
SUBJECT SPECIALIST AND ITS HISTORY; THE SPECIALIST'S FUNCTIONS; IMPLICATIONS
FOR INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS; AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
ORGANISATION OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. CONCLUSIONS RELATE THE ANGLO-SAXON VIEWS
TO THE FRENCH SITUATION. FULL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS OF THE ARTICLES ARE
APPENDED.
REFERENCE SERVICES AS A TEACHING FUNCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. REVIEWS SOME OF
THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE IDEA OF A TEACHING FUNCTION FOR REFERENCE
LIBRARIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD WITHIN THE US LIBRARY PROFESSION.
DESCRIBES THE WAY IN WHICH THE LIBRARIAN FULFILS HIS TEACHING ROLE ON A 1 TO 1
BASIS AT THE REFERENCE DESK, AND BY PREPARING VARIOUS KINDS OF USER GUIDES.
ARGUES THAT IN SCHOOL AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE
LIBRARIAN MUST BE INTENSIFIED BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES INHERENT
IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS. SUGGESTS THAT WITH DECREASING LIBRARY BUDGETS IN THE
1980S, LIBRARIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN REFERENCE SERVICES, WILL BE FACED WITH
JUSTIFYING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THAT A SUITABLE WAY OF DOING THIS WOULD BE FOR
THE LIBRARY TO BECOME A 'TEACHING LIBRARY'.
STAFFING REFERENCE SERVICE IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' A COST EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
     
(PHD THESIS-TEXAS WOMAN'S UNIVERSITY.) A GENERAL COST EFFECTIVE MODEL IS
DEVELOPED TO TEST STAFFING PATTERNS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICES.
THE MODEL IS APPLICABLE TO ANY LIBRARY AND PROVIDES EVALUATIVE DATA ON
ALTERNATIVE STAFFING STRATEGIES FOR THE REFERENCE DESK. IT IDENTIFIES 3
IMPORTANT FACTORS' PATRON'S CLASSIFICATION, FREQUENCY OF ARRIVALS, AND TYPES
OF QUESTIONS ASKED; NUMBER OF STAFF AT DESK AND EFFECT OF THEIR SKILL LEVELS
ON FASHION OF SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY'S POLICY CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE REFERENCE DESK SERVICE. THE PROCEDURE FOR THE MODEL'S IMPLEMENTATION (TO
BE CARRIED OUT BY THE MANAGEMENT) IS BASED ON STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY.
TRANSFER OF LIBRARY RESOURCES AMONG MERGING INSTITUTIONS.
     
IN 1980, THE STUDENTS AND STAFF OF THE SCHOOL OF GENERAL STUDIES, PRAHRAN
COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION (MELBOURNE, VICTORIA) WERE TRANSFERRED TO TOORAK
STATE COLLEGE, 4 KILOMETRES AWAY. THE RELEVANT LIBRARY RESOURCES WERE ALSO
TRANSFERRED. BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES AT PRAHRAN, DESCRIBES THE OPERATIONS
INVOLVED IN THE STOCK TRANSFER, WITH ESTIMATES OF THE COST.
PROBLEMS OF MERGING LIBRARIES.
     
IN FEB 80, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE TASMANIAN COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION
(CAE) AT MT NELSON (HOBART) WOULD CLOSE AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS COURSES
WOULD TRANSFER TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TASMANIA. THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BECOME
AUSTRALIA'S 1ST 'COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSITY', PROVIDING CAE-STYLE COURSES AS
WELL AS ITS TRADITIONAL ONES. ON 1 JAN 81, THE UNIVERSITY TOOK OVER THE
COLLEGE'S DEPARTMENTS OF TEACHER EDUCATION, ART, MUSIC, AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
DESCRIBES THE IMPACT ON THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; HOW THE 90,000-ITEM MT NELSON
LIBRARY WAS EVALUATED AND MERGED WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; AND HOW THE
RESULTANT COLLECTION IS BEING 'TIDIED UP'.
FROM THE OLD TEXTILE FACTORY TO THE NEW MEDIA CENTRE' AACHEN PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
THERE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN AACHEN SINCE 1831. THE PRESENT BUILDING,
OPENED IN 1980, IS THE RESULT OF REDEVELOPING AN OLD TEXTILE FACTORY AT A COST
OF 6.1 MILLION DM. THE BUILDING OFFERS 6,835 SQ.M. OF SPACE FOR 320,000 ITEMS,
WITH OVER 200 SEATS FOR READERS, ON AN IDEAL SITE CLOSE TO SCHOOLS AND THE
CENTRAL BUS STATION. THE BUILDING IS IN 4 STOREYS LINKED BY LIFTS, WITH THE
ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT IN A SEPARATE SECTION. THE GROUND FLOOR CONTAINS
ISSUE AND INFORMATION COUNTERS, A LINK WITH THE UNDERGROUND STACK, FICTION,
CHILDREN'S AND TEENAGE LIBRARIES, CATALOGUES, INTER-LIBRARY LOAN, PHOTOCOPYING

A CONVENIENT CENTRAL SITE WAS FOUND FOR THE NEW LIBRARY AT KIEL, WHOSE STOCKS
TOTAL 100,000 ITEMS. THE BUILDING WAS DESIGNED FOR FLEXIBILITY; COVERING A
TOTAL AREA OF 4,600 SQ.M., IT SETS A STANDARD FOR TOWNS OF THIS SIZE. THE
GROUND FLOOR AREA, FOR ISSUE COUNTER, CLOAKROOM AND NEWSPAPERS, IS RATHER
SMALL BUT THE UPPER STOREYS ARE GENEROUSLY PROPORTIONED. THE 1ST FLOOR HOUSES
THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY, FICTION AND A MEETING-ROOM SEATING 100 PEOPLE; A SMALL
AUDIO CENTRE IS PLANNED HERE BUT ULTIMATELY KIEL WILL PROBABLY HAVE A SEPARATE
MUSIC LIBRARY AND AUDIO CENTRE ELSEWHERE. THE 2ND FLOOR CONTAINS NON-FICTION,
PERIODICALS, NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS, PAMPHLETS, CATALOGUES AND INFORMATION
SERVICES. ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS ARE ON THE 3RD AND 4TH FLOORS AND THERE
IS ALSO A SMALL CELLAR STACK.

INFORMATION AND REFERRAL DATA: INFORMATION AND FEEDBACK FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.
     
A BOUNDARY HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A DEMARCATION LINE SEPARATING AN ORGANISATION
FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDING ACCESS FOR THE TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO
AND FROM THE ORGANISATION. USING A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE, THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL
EXPLORATORY SURVEY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION: DO I&R SERVICES, OCCUPANTS OF
BOUNDARY POSITIONS VIS-A-VIS SOCIAL ORGANISATIONS, SERVE AS SOURCES OF
INFORMATION INPUTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT FOR COUNTRY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES?
FINDINGS SHOW THAT I&R DATA ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION FROM THE
ENVIRONMENT FOR MOST OF THE AGENCIES SURVEYED, DEPENDENT NOT ONLY ON
ORGANISATIONAL SUPPORTS BUT ALSO ON FEEDBACK PROCESSES THAT ENCOURAGE
INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN ORGANISATIONS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. SUCH
DEVELOPMENTS MUST BE GUIDED BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS SUCH
DATA CAN ANSWER AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA.

HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT AND THE UK INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY-A POLICY
FOR GOVERNMENT PROMOTION OF THE INDUSTRY.
     
A BODY OF BRITISH COMPANIES ENGAGED IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN FORMED
(UKITO) TO ADVISE THE UK GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENT AND OTHER BODIES ON POLITICAL,
COMMERCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL MATTERS RELATING TO THE UK OWNED AND CONTROLLED
COMPUTER INDUSTRY WHICH MAY AFFECT NATIONAL POLICIES, AND TO ENSURE THAT THESE
ORGANISATIONS OPERATE IN FAIR AND EQUITABLE CONDITIONS IN ALL MARKETS. ARGUES
IN FAVOUR OF A STRONG, 'TRULY BRITISH' INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, AND
PRESENTS SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT POLICIES WHICH WOULD
EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE THAT INDUSTRY.
STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING UTILIZATION OF COMPUTERIZED STATISTICAL DATA BY THE
SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.
     
IN RECENT DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A NOTABLE EXPANSION OF STATISTICAL DATA
PRODUCED BY THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, RESEARCH,
POLICY AND EVALUATION PROGRAMMES. THIS IS DUE TO ADVANCES IN RELATIVELY
INEXPENSIVE AND EFFICIENT DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPUTER-READABLE
STATISTICAL DATA. CORRESPONDING CHANGES HAVE NOT OCCURRED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF
DATA COLLECTION, PRESERVATION, DESCRIPTION AND DISSEMINATION. AS A RESULT, THE
PROCESS BY WHICH DATA BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO SOCIAL RESEARCHERS AND OTHERS IS
FRUSTRATING, TIME CONSUMING, AND INEFFICIENT. DESCRIBES THE REASONS FOR THIS
SITUATION' THE PROBLEM-SOLVING WORKSTYLE OF SOCIAL DATA USERS, THE NATURE OF
THE DATA AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, AND AN INCHOATE SOCIAL
SCIENCE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
BETTER MANAGEMENT NEEDED IN AUTOMATING THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY.
     
THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 1981, THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER WILL SPEND ABOUT $24
MILLION TO DEVELOP NEW COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS, EVALUATE AND ACQUIRE READY-MADE
SYSTEMS, AND OPERATE THEM IN SUPPORT OF THE US COURTS. THESE SYSTEMS WILL NOT
REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL UNTIL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT PLANNING, COORDINATION, AND CONTROL PROBLEMS ARE
RESOLVED. GAO RECOMMENDS THAT THE DIRECTOR, FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER AND THE
DIRECTOR, ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE US COURTS WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE
PLANNING, MANAGEMENT, AND CONTROL OF DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS.

THE AUDIENCE, DISCUSSES THE RESISTANCE OF VOLUNTEER WORKERS TO NEW METHODS,
TRAINING OF VOLUNTEERS, SOCIAL CONTROL IMPLICATIONS OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY, AND
OBTAINING INFORMATION FOR A COMPUTER-HELD DIRECTORY OF COMMUNITY
ORGANISATIONS.
ATTAINABLE BENEFITS OF THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE NOT BEING
REALIZED.
     
STATES THAT USERS OF MEDICAID MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO
ADMINISTER THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMME MORE EFFICIENTLY, EFFECTIVELY, AND
ECONOMICALLY. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE (HEW) PAYS
STATES 90% OF THE COST TO DEVELOP SUCH SYSTEMS AND 75% OF THE COST TO OPERATE
THEM, INSTEAD OF THE USUAL 50% COST SHARING. HEW HAS DETERMINED THAT 17 STATES
HAVE SYSTEMS WHICH MEET LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; GAO REVIEWED
3 OF THEM. NEITHER THE STATES NOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE REALISING ALL
BENEFITS EXPECTED.

SUBSTANCE THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES DATA BANK.
A PROPOSED NEW OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM.
     
A PROPOSED OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH
THE CURRENT SYSTEM. 4 MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED.
1ST, THE NEW OUTPATIENT DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM COULD SIMPLIFY AND REDUCE
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. 2ND, THE NEW DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM COULD PROVIDE A
TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE CURRENT STATE OF READINESS OF OPERATIONAL UNITS
THROUGHOUT THE NAVY. 3RD, THIS SYSTEM COULD BE USED AS A BASIS FOR MAKING
PREDICTIONS CONCERNING STAFFING AND MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ANY MEDICAL
FACILITY UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED OUTPATIENT
SYSTEM COULD BE TIED TO THE CURRENT INPATIENT SYSTEM TO DERIVE COMPLETE
MEDICAL HISTORIES FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. BY MERGING THE 2 DATA SYSTEMS A
RESEARCH TOOL WOULD BE CREATED THAT COULD PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH AN
UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT, DISTRIBUTION, CAUSES,
AND PREVENTION OF DISEASE.

LIBRARY USER EDUCATION (IN GERMAN)
     
.FROM 5-9 SEPT 79 LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, HELD A CONFERENCE IN
CAMBRIDGE ON 'LIBRARY USER EDUCATION-ARE NEW APPROACHES NEEDED?' IT WAS OF
GREAT INTEREST TO THE VISITORS FROM WEST GERMANY AS THEY WERE ABLE TO GAIN
FIRST HAND IMPRESSIONS OF PROBLEMS AND EXPERIENCES IN LIBRARY USER EDUCATION
IN THE USA AND THE UK. LIBRARY USER EDUCATION HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD FOR
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS BUT NEEDS TO BE STANDARDISED. IT WAS FELT THAT THE
ACADEMIC LEVEL OF LIBRARY USER EDUCATION SHOULD BE RAISED AND THAT ITS
ACHIEVEMENTS WERE NOT YET FULLY RECOGNISED. THE FORM OF LIBRARY USER EDUCATION
PRACTISED IN LIBRARIES IN THE UK CANNOT BE DIRECTLY ADOPTED BY UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY OWING TO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN AREAS SUCH AS
LIBRARIAN TRAINING.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER EDUCATION IN GHANA.
     
(PHD THESIS). IN GHANA, THERE IS A POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE INFORMATION
PROBLEM, BUT USER EDUCATION IS NOT PURSUED WITH SIMILAR ENTHUSIASM. EXAMINES
THE PRESENT USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES/ACTIVITIES IN GHANAIAN EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS AND RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING THE
CONSTRAINTS WHICH AFFECT SUCH PROGRAMMES. MAKES PROPOSALS FOR A BASIC
INFRA-STRUCTURE, THE REVISION OF PRESENT PROGRAMMES WHERE NEEDED, AND A
CAREFULLY-DESIGNED APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY FOR EACH CATEGORY OF USER.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTIONS IN BUSINESS LIBRARIES.
     
RECENT ARTICLES HAVE DISCUSSED THE BUSINESS STUDENT'S LACK OF SKILL IN USING
THE LIBRARY AND THE NEED FOR LIBRARIANS AND TEACHING FACULTY TO BECOME
INVOLVED IN PREPARING THESE FUTURE BUSINESS LEADERS TO DO LIBRARY-CENTRED
RESEARCH. A SURVEY OF 120 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY USEFUL
AND EFFECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION METHODS. NEARLY 50% OF THE RESPONDENTS
FELT THAT TEACHING LIBRARY USE IN CONNECTION WITH A REGULAR COURSE IN THE
CURRICULUM WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION. OF THOSE
RESPONDING, 88% OF THE LIBRARIES ARE USING THIS METHOD.
COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION AND LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXPLAINS BRIEFLY
THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION-AN EDUCATIONAL APPROACH WHICH
STRUCTURES LEARNING AROUND COMPETENCIES DEFINED AS FUNDAMENTAL FOR SUCCESSFUL
PERFORMANCE, AND APPLIES THE CONCEPT TO LIBRARY USER EDUCATION. DISCUSSES THE
EXPERIENCES OF THE FOLLOWING US EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN
COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMMES' ALVERNO COLLEGE; DOANE COLLEGE; SANGAMON STATE
UNIVERSITY; THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE; FINDLAY COLLEGE; AND THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN-PARKSIDE. IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT CAN BE
DERIVED FROM ADOPTING THE COMPETENCY BASED APPROACH TO LIBRARY INSTRUCTION,
BUT RECOGNISES ITS LIMITATIONS, AND POINTS OUT THAT IT MAY BE UNSUITABLE FOR
SOME INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE IT IS TOO TIME CONSUMING AND DEMANDING.
THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE LIBRARIAN IN THE TOTAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXAMINES THE
EXTENT TO WHICH PROGRAMMES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED
INTO THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OF THE US COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. REVIEWS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES SINCE THE 1930S, AND ARGUES THAT
TRUE INVOLVEMENT IN THE TOTAL EDUCATIONAL PLANNING PROCESS IS STILL UNREALISED
ON A VAST SCALE, AND THAT THE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTOR PREFERS TO REMAIN
INDEPENDENT OF LIBRARIANS WHEN STRUCTURING ACADEMIC PROGRAMMES.
USER EDUCATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A CENTURY IN RETROSPECT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY ISSUE INSTRUCTION. EXAMINES THE
SUBJECT OF USER EDUCATION IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES FROM ITS HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE. CREDITS RALPH WALDO EMERSON WITH FORMULATING THE BASIC CONCEPT OF
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION, AND INTERTWINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL THOUGHT
AND PHILOSOPHY WITH AN INCREASING CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE NEED OF USERS TO
UNDERSTAND LIBRARIES. CONSIDERS THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY 20TH CENTURY
EXPERIMENTS WITH LIBRARY USER INSTRUCTION, AND REVIEWS SOME OF THE CONFLICTS
WHICH EMERGED AS STRONGER ASSERTATIONS WERE MADE IN FAVOUR OF THIS
INSTRUCTION. ARGUES THAT THERE IS A CONTINUING LACK OF SOUND PHILOSOPHICAL AND
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS TO SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT FOR LIBRARY USER INSTRUCTION.
IMPROVING USER TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
     
THE AIM OF USER TRAINING IS TO DEVELOP THE ABILITY OF THE USER TO MAKE FULL
USE OF LIBRARY STOCK AND FACILITIES. THE USER MUST UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES
OF THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED IN THE PUBLIC AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES. A
GROUP CALLED LIBRARY WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE EXAMINED THE WAY IN WHICH A
BROCHURE INTRODUCING YOUNG PEOPLE TO LIBRARY USE WAS BEING USED IN PRACTICE.
MORE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN USER TRAINING THROUGH INCREASED
COOPERATION WITH TEACHERS AT TRAINING COLLEGES AND INSTRUCTORS OF APPRENTICES.
USER TRAINING SESSIONS SHOULD BE PLANNED TO INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE ACTIVELY,
TAKING THEIR SPECIAL INTERESTS INTO CONSIDERATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT
LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN USER TRAINING
METHODS AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT.
RESEARCH STRATEGIES' BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION FOR UNDERGRADUATES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXAMINES THEORY
AND PRACTICE CONCERNED WITH THE NATURE OF EDUCATION IN RESEARCH STRATEGIES-OR
SEARCH STRATEGIES, THE MORE COMMONLY USED DESIGNATION. RECOGNISES THE
DISAGREEMENT AMONGST PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE PRECISE MEANING OF THESE TERMS,
AND DISCUSSES THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IN RESEARCH
STRATEGIES' THE LEVEL OF STUDENT TO BE TAUGHT; THE CONTENT OF INSTRUCTION; THE
METHODS USED TO TEACH; AND WHO SHOULD TEACH. USES EXAMPLES FROM THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE POINTS MADE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. CONCLUDES
THAT THE SUCCESSFUL EDUCATION OF UNDERGRADUATES IN RESEARCH STRATEGIES HINGES
PRIMARILY ON THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT IS TO BE TAUGHT, AND THAT THE OTHER
QUESTIONS, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIMPORTANT, ARE AT PRESENT, OF SECONDARY CONCERN.
LIBRARY USE EDUCATION' CURRENT PRACTICES AND TRENDS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. DESCRIBES AND
EVALUATES THE WORK OF THE LIBRARY ORIENTATION/INSTRUCTION EXCHANGE (LOEX)
OFFICE AT EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A CLEARING HOUSE AND
CENTRAL EXCHANGE FOR LIBRARY USER INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN THE USA. INCLUDES
A NUMBER OF STATISTICS WHICH ILLUSTRATE THE VARIETY OF INSTRUCTIONAL
APPROACHES, METHODS, MATERIALS, AND PROJECTS USED IN A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARY
INSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES IN 1979, AND COMPARES THEM WITH THE FIGURES AVAILABLE
FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IN 1973. SUGGESTS AN OUTLINE PLAN OF ACTION FOR BASIC
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
EVALUATING BIBLIOGRAPHIC EDUCATION' A REVIEW AND CRITIQUE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. DISCUSSES SOME
REASONS FOR EVALUATING BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES. DESCRIBES THE USE
OF THE TEST, THE SURVEY, AND ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION AS METHODS OF EVALUATION
BY VARIOUS US AND EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. CONSIDERS THE STATISTICAL
AND OTHER PROBLEMS INVOLVED WITH THESE TECHNIQUES, AND ARGUES THAT NONE OF
THEM ARE COMPLETELY SATISFACTORY, AND THAT IT MAY BE SOME TIME BEFORE TESTING
PROCEDURES CATCH UP WITH USER INSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES.
GUIDELINES FOR THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC AGENCY AND THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
PREPARED BY THE IFLA INTERNATIONAL OFFICE FOR UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL,
THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO HELP ALL COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF A REGULARLY-APPEARING NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES. THEY
ALSO OFFER PRACTICAL GUIDANCE ON THE PREPARATION OF NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS, THE PRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE
MACHINERY REQUIRED (I.E. THE ROLE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC
AGENCY).
IMPORTANCE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OVER INFORMATION (IN ARABIC).
     
ORGANISATION AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION HAVE BECOME DIFFICULT AS A RESULT OF
KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION AND THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES OF PUBLICATION. THE MAIN
PROBLEM IS THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OVER LIBRARY MATERIALS WHICH CAN BE
SOLVED BY BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORKS BASED ON THE SUBJECT AND QUALITATIVE PRINCIPLES.
THE USE OF AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL MUST BE CONSIDERED.

AN AGRICULTURE LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF A SMALL SCALE MANUAL CURRENT
AWARENESS SERVICE AT A BRAZILIAN AGRICULTURE LIBRARY, BIBLIOTECA ESTADUAL DE
AGRICULTURA DO PARANA. THE SERVICE WAS LIMITED TO PERIODICALS OVER A 1 YEAR
PERIOD. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTING USER PROFILES,
ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE, AND NOTIFICATION. TO DATE, RELEVANCE IS ABOUT 70%, BUT
AN INITIAL LACK OF COOPERATION FROM USERS MAKES ACCURATE ASSESSMENT DIFFICULT.
A STUDY OF PERIODICAL USAGE IS BEING PLANNED.
AN APPROACH TO THE CLIENTS AND USES OF SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION
(SDI) SYSTEMS' THE ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING OF SUBSCRIBERS TO AN INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SERVICE.
     
(PHD THESIS-SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY.) EXAMINES THE USER OF SDI SYSTEMS. THE DATA
THUS OBTAINED DO NOT SUPPORT THE CURRENT MODEL RELATING TO THE IDENTIFYING OF
USERS AND USES OF SDI SERVICES, AND EXPOSE THE MODEL AND ITS THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK AS BEING TOO NARROW, EXCLUDING SEVERAL SEGMENTS OF THE USER
COMMUNITY. DEVELOPS AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL BASED ON MASS COMMUNICATION THEORY
AND INCORPORATING SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION THEORY. THE NEW MODEL IDENTIFIES
THE CLIENTS OF SDI SERVICES AS A CLUSTER OF SOCIAL ACTORS, EACH PERFORMING
SOME TASK IN OBTAINING AND USING SDI SERVICES.
CONTINUING EDUCATION IN CANCER FOR THE COMMUNITY PHYSICIAN' DESIGN AND
EVALUATION OF A REGIONAL TABLE OF CONTENTS SERVICE.
     
DESCRIBES A RESEARCH PROJECT DESIGNED TO DISCOVER WHETHER US COMMUNITY
PHYSICIANS WOULD USE AND BENEFIT FROM A STRUCTURED PROGRAMME TO ASSIST THEM IN
REVIEWING CURRENT MEDICAL LITERATURE. 2 GROUPS OF PHYSICIANS WERE GIVEN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW REGULARLY THEIR CHOICE OF 18 CANCER JOURNAL TABLES OF
CONTENTS WITH THE ADDED PROVISION OF BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY ARTICLES OF
INTEREST. ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT AND CONCLUDES THAT THE SERVICE
IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR SOME COMMUNITY PHYSICIANS,
AND IS EASY TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN, ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT COSTLY.

SUMMARY AND ADDENDA TO THE SEPTEMBER 1979 BAY AREA REFERENCE CENTER WORKSHOP.
     
PARTICIPANTS IN A WORKSHOP ON THE ETHICS AND PROBLEMS OF MEDICAL REFERENCE
SERVICE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES GENERALLY CONCLUDED THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
INFORMATION CONCERNING HEALTH AND LIBRARIANS SHOULD RELY ON COMMON SENSE IN
ANSWERING MEDICAL REFERENCE QUESTIONS AND REFRAIN FROM INTERPRETATION AND
DIAGNOSIS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
IF ONLY THEY HAD A TELEPHONE...'.A
     
RGUES THAT MUCH REFERENCE WORK IS BASED ON INADEQUATE AND OUTDATED REFERENCE
MATERIAL LEADING TO WRONG ANSWERS TO QUERIES. FOR THIS REASON A PROJECT AIMED
AT BUILDING UP A REGIONAL INFORMATION CENTRE AT THE REGIONAL LIBRARY IN KALMAR
WAS INITIATED. THE AIM WAS TO ACHIEVE A WELL SELECTED REFERENCE STOCK IN ALL
LIBRARIES ACCORDING TO SIZE AND NEED, EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE AIDS AND OF THE
REGIONAL LIBRARY'S REFERENCE SECTION. A PRECONDITION OF THIS IS A WELL
FUNCTIONING TELEPHONE SERVICE. IN ORDER TO COORDINATE AND IMPROVE INFORMATION
SUPPLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL, PLANS SHOULD BE MADE FOR INFORMATION ACTIVITY WITHIN
A MUNICIPALITY AND REGION WHICH INCLUDE TRAINING OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS, AND
THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE MORE WIDELY ADVERTISED AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION.
ELECTRONIC MAIL HAS A FUTURE IN THE LIBRARY.
     
IN 1982 THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE WILL BEGIN THE 1ST PART OF A 3-PHASE
PLAN TO OFFER AMERICANS ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF MAIL. THE IMPORTANT POTENTIAL
THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS FOR LIBRARIES IS DISCUSSED. DOCUMENTS CAN BE SENT VIA
ELECTRONIC MAIL AS FACSIMILE MESSAGES OR DISPLAYED ON THE LIBRARY C.R.T.
INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN MINUTES USING A
SPECIAL LIBRARY ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM.

INFORMATION NETWORK (RLIN). THE LINKS EXAMINED WERE DIRECT TAPE DELIVERY,
ON-LINE 'NATIVE' MODE VIA DEDICATED LINE AND ON-LINE 'TRANSLATION' MODE VIA
DEDICATED LINE. RESULTS OF THE STUDY ARE DISCUSSED AND THE NEXT STEPS FOR
NETWORK PLANNERS ARE SUGGESTED.
THE SERIALS DEPARTMENT.
     
ANALYSES THE DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY
OF SERIALS DEPARTMENTS, LOOKING IN PARTICULAR AT THE CURRENT PRACTICES IN
AUSTRALIAN TERTIARY LIBRARIES. IN MOST LIBRARIES, THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
APPEARS TO BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS HISTORICAL ACCIDENTS, SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES, PERSONNEL ARRANGEMENTS, OR ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS, AND NOT
ON ANY ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION TAKEN ON THE BASIS OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE
SPECIAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN SERIALS WORK. WITH SHRINKING BUDGETS REINFORCING
THE TREND TOWARDS LIBRARY COOPERATION AND AUTOMATION, LIBRARIES WILL NEED TO
REVIEW THEIR ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES TO SUIT FUTURE TECHNOLOGY.
THE AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE AND THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS' A TWELVE-YEAR
PERSPECTIVE.
     
THE AFI WAS CREATED IN 1967 BY THE US NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND
HUMANITIES AS A PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT, NON-GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION TO SERVE THE
PUBLIC INTEREST. IN 1968 IT ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WHEREBY LC WOULD EXPAND ESTABLISHED PROGRAMMES TO
ACQUIRE, PRESERVE AND RETAIN MOTION PICTURES FOR THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF
MOTION PICTURES. THE AFI ALLOCATED FUNDS TO LC TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES AND
TO AID ITS INSPECTION, HANDLING, CATALOGUING, PRESERVING AND STORING OF FILMS.
THE ARRANGEMENT HAS PERMITTED THE EVOLUTION OF A PRACTICAL WORKING
RELATIONSHIP WHEREBY EACH INSTITUTION DOES WHAT IT IS BEST SUITED TO.
DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE WORK OF BOTH BODIES, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN
COLLABORATION.
BOOK SELECTION IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARY (IN ARABIC).
     
BOOK SELECTION IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES REQUIRES A METICULOUS, CONSCIOUS AND
CLEAR POLICY. CONCENTRATES ON THE SELECTION OF STORY BOOKS AND STATES THAT THE
SELECTION OF NON-FICTION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY SUBJECT SPECIALISTS. THE
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP IN TOUCH WITH CHILDREN'S INTERESTS AND
FAVOURITE READINGS.
COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT IN TEN SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A REPORT TO THE
COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES.
     
THIS INVESTIGATION OF HOW 10 SMALL, PRIVATE COLLEGE LIBRARIES GO ABOUT
COLLECTING BOOKS FOCUSES ON THE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND CONTROL THOSE
LIBRARIES EXERCISE OVER WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THEIR COLLECTIONS. THE FINDINGS
AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY ARE BASED UPON INTERVIEWS WITH LIBRARY
ADMINISTRATORS AND ACQUISITIONS LIBRARIANS AT MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE, BOWDOIN,
COLBY, BATES, WELLESLEY, AMHERST, TRINITY, HAMILTON, UNION, AND COLGATE. THESE
COLLEGES WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THIER SIMILARITIES OF PURPOSE, STAFF SIZE,
STUDENT ENROLLMENT, FACULTY, NUMBER OF LIBRARY VOLUMES ADDED ANNUALLY, LIBRARY
BUDGETS, AND LIBRARY HOLDINGS. CHAPTERS IDENTIFY THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY,
THE METHODOLOGY USED, FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
SELECTED LIST OF BOOKS AND JOURNALS FOR THE SMALL MEDICAL LIBRARY.
     
9TH REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PUBLISHED EVERY 2 YEARS SINCE 1965. NAMING 539
BOOKS AND 136 JOURNALS, IT IS INTENDED AS A SELECTION GUIDE FOR SMALL- OR
MEDIUM-SIZED MEDICAL LIBRARIES. BOOKS AND JOURNALS ARE LISTED SEPARATELY BY
SUBJECT. THERE IS AN AUTHOR INDEX, AND AN ALPHABETICAL JOURNAL TITLE LISTING.
TO PURCHASE ALL THE BOOKS AND PAY ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR ALL THE JOURNALS
WOULD COST ABOUT $30,000. TO ACQUIRE THE 137 BOOKS AND 54 JOURNALS RECOMMENDED
FOR INITIAL PURCHASE BY SMALLER LIBRARIES WOULD COST ABOUT $8,900. FOR THE
PREVIOUS VERSION, SEE 80/450.
LOVE, ETC., IN YOUNG ADULT FICTION, 1956-79.
     
AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF YOUNG ADULT FICTION CONCERNING HETEROSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS, WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED IN THE USA IN 1956-79 AND AIMED AT 12-18
YEAR-OLDS. ITS AIMS ARE TO' SHOW LIBRARIANS WHAT FICTION IS AVAILABLE ON THIS
SUBJECT; HELP THEM DETERMINE WHICH ARE WORTHWHILE; INDICATE CHANGES IN
ATTITUDES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS AS REFLECTED IN THE FICTION; AND HELP
LIBRARIANS TO DETERMINE WHETHER 20-YEAR-OLD FICTION CONTAINS ATTITUDES WITH
WHICH TODAY'S READERS CAN RELATE. BY STUDYING ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY AND
FICTION, LIBRARIANS CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TODAY'S PROBLEMS AND ATTITUDES ARE
BEING DEALT WITH REALISTICALLY FOR TODAY'S TEENAGERS.
AN EXAMINATION OF CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO SUCCESS OF FRIENDS GROUPS IN
MEDICAL SCHOOL RARE BOOK LIBRARIES.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON D.C., 18 JUNE 80. PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF
A STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO DISCOVER HOW EFFECTIVE FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS ARE
AS SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR US MEDICAL RARE BOOK LIBRARIES. CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE MEDICAL RARE BOOK LIBRARY AND OF FRIENDS GROUPS WERE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY
THOSE WHICH ARE CORRELATED WITH SUCCESSFUL FRIENDS GROUPS. CORRELATIONS WERE
FOUND BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CONTRIBUTED BY THE FRIENDS GROUP AND THE AGE
OF THE GROUP; THE LIBRARIAN'S PARTICIPATION IN FORMING IT; AND THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY SPENT BY THE LIBRARY ON THE GROUP. RECOMMENDS WAYS OF INCREASING THE
LEVEL OF DONATIONS FROM FRIENDS GROUPS, AND OF MANAGING THESE FUNDS MORE
EFFECTIVELY.
ACQUISITIONS BUDGET CONTROL IN A CAE LIBRARY.
     
OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF ACQUISITIONS BUDGET CONTROL AT THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY (KNOWN AS THE T.L. ROBERTSON LIBRARY). DURING
THE 1970S, THE ACQUISITIONS BUDGET WAS ADEQUATE; THIS IS NOW QUESTIONABLE.
DISCUSSES THE BUDGET CONTROL OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE LIBRARY AND SUGGESTS A
FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO SUBJECT BUDGETS, A PORTION OF THE MONOGRAPH BUDGET BEING
EARMARKED FOR SPECIAL NEEDS AND THE REMAINING LARGER SHARE BEING APPORTIONED
TO THE SUBJECT AREAS.
PROPERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION. DELIVERY OF DEPOSITORY COPIES TO STATE
LIBRARIES IN REFERENCE TO PARAGRAPH 14 OF THE BASIC LAW (GRUNDGESETZ).
     
THE CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION AS TO WHETHER PUBLISHERS SHOULD BE LEGALLY REQUIRED
TO SUPPLY DEPOSITORY COPIES FREE OF CHARGE TO LIBRARIES IS ONCE AGAIN BEING
DISCUSSED IN WEST GERMANY. SOME PUBLISHERS IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG CHALLENGED
THIS REQUIREMENT AND TOOK THEIR CASE BEFORE THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
AN AMENDED LAW WAS PASSED IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION
WHEREBY PUBLISHERS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO SUPPLY 1 COPY FREE OF CHARGE BUT CAN
BE RECOMPENSED FOR UP TO 50% OF THEIR COSTS FOR ANY FURTHER COPIES. IN THE
LIGHT OF THE CONSTITUTION DELIVERING DEPOSITORY COPIES IS TO BE SEEN AS A
SOCIAL DUTY DIRECTLY LINKED TO PROPERTY OWNERSHIP. THE PUBLISHER HAS A DUTY TO
THE PUBLIC TO SUPPLY LIBRARIES WITH CURRENT LITERATURE BUT A BALANCE MUST BE
STRUCK BETWEEN THIS AND THE FINANCIAL LIMITS OF THE PUBLISHER.
EXCHANGE AS A TRADITIONAL METHOD OF ACQUISITION FOR NATIONAL LIBRARIES.
     
(MA DISSERTATION.) ANALYSES THE MAIN ISSUES AND CONCEPTS THAT SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED BY THE LIBRARY PROFESSION IN COUNTRIES WITHOUT A TRADITION OF
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES OF OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS AND DOCUMENTS. DEFINES THESE
TERMS AND EXAMINES THE UNESCO SPECIAL CONVENTION ON THE SUBJECT. EXAMINES
DIFFERENT ORGANISATION PATTERNS ARISING FROM INTERCHANGE OF DUPLICATES AND
NOTES THE 2 ARRANGEMENTS BEST SUITED FOR NATIONWIDE OPERATION (THE COLLECTING
DEPOT AND THE CENTRAL BUREAU). TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION, MAKES
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEW INSTITUTO AUTONOMO BIBLIOTECA NACIONAL Y DE
SERVICIAS DE BIBLIOTECAS IN VENEZUELA (WHICH ABSORBED THE BIBLIOTECA NACIONAL
IN 1977) AND THE CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS Y
TECNOLOGICAS (CONICIT).
FRENCH INTERLIBRARY LOAN STATISTICS, 1978-79.
     
THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS FOR FRENCH ACADEMIC LIBRARIES SHOW A QUANTITATIVE
INCREASE SINCE 1975. RESULTS ARE TABULATED, TO SHOW' TOTAL INCREASE IN LOANS;
EXCHANGES BETWEEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS; LOANS BY
DISCIPLINE; LOANS BETWEEN PARIS AND THE PROVINCES; FOREIGN LOANS; CHIEF
PARTICIPANTS IN THE SERVICE; AND KINDS OF DOCUMENTS CIRCULATED.
THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF UNIVERSITIES GUIDELINES FOR LOANS BETWEEN UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES. MAY 1981.
     
THE NEW OFFICIAL GUIDELINES ARE PRESENTED, COVERING ALL PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN
LOAN OPERATIONS, WITH SEPARATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR TELEX. THE FUNDAMENTAL AIM IS
TO SIMPLIFY PROCEDURES, IMPROVE SERVICES, AND RATIONALISE DOCUMENT DELIVERY
AND RETURN. SAMPLE LOAN REQUEST FORMS ARE APPENDED.
SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES).F
     
OR ABSTRACTS OF THE 2 PAPERS IN THIS SECTION, (ONE ON BANGLADESH, THE OTHER ON
BRAZIL), 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'-.
A VIEW FROM BANGLADESH.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM IS VITAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND
SUPPORT OF LITERACY, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, AND OF INDUSTRY AND THE ECONOMY
GENERALLY. INTERLENDING TAKES PLACE IN BANGLADESH BETWEEN CERTAIN GROUPS OF
LIBRARIES BUT PROGRESS IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF A STRONG NATIONAL LIBRARY TO
GIVE LEADERSHIP IN SHARED ACQUISITION AND INTERLENDING POLICIES. ANOTHER
PROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY COME UNDER DIFFERENT
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, WITH NO COORDINATION AGENCY. PROGRESS WILL DEPEND ON
SYSTEMATIC COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES.
A VIEW FROM BRAZIL.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE LIBRARY PLANNING IN BRAZIL
INCLUDE ITS LARGE SIZE, ITS VERY YOUNG POPULATION, ITS STRUGGLING
SEMI-INDUSTRIALISED ECONOMY, THE UNEVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION, AND LOW LEVELS OF
RESEARCH ACTIVITY AND PUBLISHING OUTPUT. MODERNISATION MEANS THAT THE DEMAND
FOR DOCUMENTS IS POTENTIALLY VERY LARGE. DOCUMENT SUPPLY WILL BE ORGANISED
THROUGH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC OR ADMINISTRATIVE SECTORS, SUCH AS AGRICULTURE,
ENERGY, OR EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THESE WILL NEED TO BE COORDINATED TO AVOID GAPS
OR UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION IN SUBJECT COVERAGE, AND SOME DEGREE OF
CENTRALISATION IS DESIRABLE.
NALNET BOOK SYSTEM' COST BENEFIT STUDY.
     
THE GOALS OF THE NASA'S LIBRARY NETWORK SYSTEM, NALNET, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE
CURRENT BOOK SYSTEM, THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF A BOOK SYSTEM REQUIRED BY
NASA CENTRE LIBRARIES, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BEST
SUPPLY THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE ASSESSED. EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON
DETERMINING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF MEETING NASA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR
AN AUTOMATED BOOK SYSTEM. VARIOUS OPERATING MODES WERE EXAMINED INCLUDING THE
CURRENT STIMS FILE, THE PUBFILE, DEVELOPING SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS
AS APPROPRIATE TO THE CENTRE NEEDS, AND OBTAINING CATALOGUING AND PRODUCTS
FROM THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES INCLUDING AT LEAST OCLC, RLIN, BNA, AND STIF.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT NALNET OPERATE UNDER THE STIMS FILE MODE AND OBTAIN
CATALOGUING AND PRODUCTS FROM THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES.
COLLECTION EVALUATION.
     
ALTHOUGH BOOKS ARE SO EXPENSIVE THAT TO THROW AWAY ANY SEEMS A MAJOR STEP, IT
IS AS IMPORTANT AS EVER TO KEEP A SCHOOL LIBRARY COLLECTION ATTRACTIVE AND
UP-TO-DATE BY REMOVING ALL BOOKS THAT ARE NO LONGER OF VALUE. OFFERS
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING AND WITHDRAWING BOOKS AND EXPLAINS WHY DESTRUCTION
IS THE MOST SUITABLE FATE FOR MOST DISCARDED STOCK.
A SURVEY OF THE WEEDING OF LIBRARY BOOKS IN THE U.S.A. AND THE U.K., 1902 TO
DATE.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON WEEDING BOOKSTOCK AND RELATED
TOPICS. PRESENTS A CHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORY OF WEEDING IN THE UK
AND USA, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE APPROACHES TO THE
SUBJECT. THE APPLICATIONS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO RELEGATION ARE SURVEYED
TOGETHER WITH THE ATKINSON PROPOSALS FOR UK ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND THE
POTENTIAL OF COMPUTERS IN WEEDING BOOKS.
PRINCIPLES FOR PRESERVING AND RESTORING LIBRARY COLLECTIONS.
     
THE PRINCIPLES FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS ARE
SET OUT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF IFLA'S PRESERVATION
SECTION. THE AIM OF THE PRINCIPLES IS TO INCREASE LIBRARY STAFF'S AWARENESS OF
THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING AND RESTORING NOT ONLY ARCHIVE MATERIAL BUT ALSO
CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE COLLECTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IS THAT OF
SUITABLE STORAGE FACILITIES. MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGH
UNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES
(MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF
THE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THE
USER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT IS
UNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS
LIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TO
FALSIFICATION AND DISTORTION OF THE ORIGINAL .
ALECSO AND SPECIAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN THE ARAB COUNTRIES.
     
THE INTELLECTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ARAB-ISLAMIC CIVILISATION OF THE MIDDLE
AGES WERE RECORDED IN MANUSCRIPTS. A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE MILLION SURVIVING
MANUSCRIPTS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS,
BUT AN AUTHORITY SHOULD EXIST TO UNDERTAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS
OF THE PRESERVATION, PROCESSING, MAINTENANCE, AND RESTORATION OF UNPUBLISHED
MANUSCRIPTS AND TO MAKE THEM KNOWN WORLD-WIDE. ALECSO (ARAB LEAGUE
EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION) SHOULD BE THE AUTHORITY,
WORKING THROUGH ITS INSTITUTE OF ARAB MANUSCRIPTS AND DEPARTMENT OF
DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION. DESCRIBES THE CURRENT ACTIVITIES OF THESE 2
ESTABLISHMENTS.
PREVENTIVE CONSERVATION FOR MAP COLLECTIONS.
     
THE PHYSICAL CARE OF MAPS AND PLANS IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY PERSONS USED TO
WORKING WITH MORE TRADITIONAL FORMS OF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL MATERIALS. THE MAP
CURATOR, AS WELL AS BEING FAMILIAR WITH BROAD CONSERVATION MEASURES SUCH AS
PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, NEEDS TO DEVELOP MORE SPECIALISED KNOWLEDGE
OF STORAGE POSSIBILITIES AND TECHNIQUES FOR HANDLING OVERSIZED MATERIAL.
CONSERVATION METHODS THAT HAVE PROVEN USEFUL IN MAP COLLECTIONS AND GUIDELINES
FOR RESEARCHERS AND STAFF ARE DESCRIBED.
TATTLE TAPE SECURITY SYSTEM.
     
A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE INSTALLATION OF 3M TATTLE TAPE SECURITY SYSTEMS BY THE
YORK REGIONAL LIBRARY IN LIBRARIES IN OROMOCTO AND FREDERICTON (NEW
BRUNSWICK). OUTLINES REASONS FOR CHOOSING THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM, DISCUSSES
ITS LOCATION IN THE LIBRARIES, AND VOICES CONCERN OVER DESIGN DEFECTS
(ALTHOUGH THESE ARE FEW).
EXAMINATION OF WASTAGE AND PROTECTION AGAINST THEFT; EXPERIENCES FROM
GOTHENBURG CITY LIBRARY.
     
WHEN GOTHENBURG CITY LIBRARY INTRODUCED BUMS, (BIBLIOTEKSTJANST UTLANINGS OCH
MEDIAKONTROLL SYSTEM) WHICH NECESSITATED A TOTAL STOCKTAKING OF THE BOOKS
LISTED IN THE CARD CATALOGUE, IT WAS FOUND THAT 25% OF THE STOCK WAS MISSING.
SPOT CHECKS AFTER BUMS WAS ESTABLISHED SHOWED LOSSES OF 4% ANNUALLY, OR 10,000
VOLUMES. INTRODUCTION OF A THEFT PREVENTION SYSTEM WAS COMBINED WITH A NEW
COMPUTER CHECK-OUT SYSTEM. AFTER STUDY VISITS, THE CHECKPOINT BY-PASS SYSTEM
WAS FOUND MOST SUITABLE FOR A PUBLIC LIBRARY OF GOTHENBURG'S SIZE. A METAL
STRIP IS EMBEDDED IN THE BOOK WHICH RELEASES A SOUND SIGNAL IF THE BOOK IS
TAKEN OUT UNREGISTERED. AFTER SOME TEETHING TROUBLES THE SYSTEM IS WORKING
WELL AND THE STAFF HANDLE GUILTY BORROWERS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. IT IS HOPED TO
OBTAIN 80% SECURITY.
THE SHORT LOAN LIBRARY SYSTEM AT THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
     
A STUDY UNDERTAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY'S OFFICE FOR RESEARCH
IN ACADEMIC METHODS AT THE REQUEST OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE CURRENT
SHORT LOAN SYSTEM IN THE J.B. CHIFLEY LIBRARY BUILDING (SERVING STAFF AND
STUDENTS IN THE FACULTIES OF ARTS, ASIAN STUDIES, ECONOMICS, AND SCIENCE) WAS
ASSESSED; THE VIEWS OF STUDENTS, TEACHING STAFF, AND LIBRARY PERSONNEL
INVOLVED IN ITS OPERATION WERE SOUGHT; AND RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DEVELOPED FOR
CHANGES AND ALTERNATIVE PROVISIONS TO MEET EXPRESSED NEEDS.
THE MICROFICHE' ITS USE IN CONTROL OF EXCHANGE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1978 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE ON MICROFORMS DESCRIBING THE
USE OF MICROFICHE FOR THE INTERLIBRARY LOAN SYSTEM AT THE REGIONAL MEDICAL
LIBRARY (BIREME-BIBLIOTECA REGIONAL DE MEDICINA), TO SOLVE THE STORAGE PROBLEM
OF SOME 40,000 REQUESTS RECEIVED EACH YEAR. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NEW
REQUEST FORMS, WHICH PERMIT IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO USERS, SECURE
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL, AND COLLECTION OF STATISTICAL DATA. THE PROBLEMS OF
CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS ARE OUTLINED, AND USE OF MICROFICHE SHOWN TO FACILITATE
SEARCHING AND ALLOW DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES THROUGHOUT THE LOAN NETWORK.
GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER-BASED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEMS
IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH). ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF A LITERATURE
REVIEW, QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS, AND INTERVIEWS AND CONCLUDES THAT NIGERIAN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY COMPUTER-BASED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEMS SHOULD BE
DEVELOPED USING AN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS CONCEPT. UNIVERSITY COMPUTER CENTRE
FACILITIES SHOULD BE USED RATHER THAN COMMERCIAL BUREAUX. GIVEN NIGERIA'S
INFRASTRUCTURE, A COMPLETELY ON-LINE REAL-TIME SYSTEM WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE
IMMEDIATELY AND AN INTERMEDIATE OFF-LINE/ON-LINE HYBRID IS SUGGESTED.
COPYRIGHT' A SURVEY OF SOLUTIONS TO THE PHOTOCOPYING DEBATE.
     
EXPANDED AND CORRECTED VERSION OF AN ADDRESS TO THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF
AUSTRALIA ACT BRANCH'S COPYRIGHT WORKSHOP, 1 JUNE 81. SURVEYS CURRENT
COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION IN THE USA, UK, AND AUSTRALIA; EXPLAINS THE STRAIN
IMPOSED BY TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES; AND DISCUSSES PROPOSALS FOR NEW LEGISLATION.
CORPORATE GHOSTS IN THE PHOTOCOPYING MACHINE.
     
THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO MAKE A DETAILED, AUTOMATIC RECORD OF PHOTOCOPYING OF
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL IN THE USA. THE MANUFACTURERS OF PHOTOCOPIERS SHOULD BE
REQUIRED TO INSTALL THIS EQUIPMENT ON THEIR MACHINES AND ACCEPT THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY IN REGARD TO COPYRIGHT.
COPYRIGHT COMPLIANCE IN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES' A STATUS REPORT TWO YEARS
AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PL 94-553.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE US MEDICAL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C., JUNE 80. BRIEFLY REVIEWS DEVELOPMENTS
SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW US COPYRIGHT LAW (PL 94-553) IN JAN 78 AND
REPORTS ON A US-WIDE SURVEY OF ACADEMIC, HOSPITAL, AND SPECIAL HEALTH SCIENCES
LIBRARIES. THE LIBRARIES WERE ASKED TO REPORT ANONYMOUSLY ON THEIR CURRENT
POLICIES AND THE PROCEDURES USED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW LAW. THEY WERE ALSO
ASKED TO INDICATE ANY SPECIAL CONCERNS THEY HAVE WITH THE LAW OR THE
GUIDELINES THEY HAVE FOLLOWED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, US
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AND THAT COMPLIANCE HAS
NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED LIBRARY SERVICES.
A SIMPLE NUMERIC FILING SYSTEM FOR 7.5- AND 15-MINUTE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS' THE
MCLANE SYSTEM.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 43RD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC COAST
GEOGRAPHERS, RENO, JUNE 80. UNTIL AUG 79, MINES LIBRARY, PART OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LIBRARY, RENO, ARRANGED ALL OF ITS US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
7&H-MINUTE AND 15-MINUTE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS ALPHABETICALLY BY STATE AND
QUADRANGLE NAME, BUT ADJACENT QUADRANGLES ARE THEN NOT FILED TOGETHER. ALVIN
MCLANE, CONSULTANT, DEVISED A NEW SYSTEM' THE MCLANE SYSTEM' USING THE 2USGS
INDEX TO TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS1, EACH 15-MINUTE QUADRANGLE IS NUMBERED
CONSECUTIVELY FROM WEST TO EAST STARTING FROM THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE
STATE WITH NUMBER ONE, AND ASSIGNING NUMBERS TO QUADRANGLES REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN MAPPED. DESCRIBES THE ADVANTAGES AND FLEXIBILITY, AND
SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM. FOR A LOCAL OR REGIONAL COLLECTION,
THE INVESTMENT IN TIME IN SETTING UP AND USING THE SYSTEM WOULD BE MINIMAL AND
THE REWARDS OF EA SE OF ACCESSING AND FILING WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL.
SERVING THE BILINGUAL CLIENT' A PROBLEM IN CATALOGUE ACCESS IN THE PROVINCE OF
QUEBEC.
     
SUMMARISES THE STANDARDS PROPOSED BY THE CANADIAN TASK GROUP ON CATALOGUING
STANDARDS TO MEET THE BILINGUAL REQUIREMENTS OF CANADIAN LIFE. SURVEYS THE
REACTION OF LIBRARIES IN QUEBEC PROVINCE AND CONCLUDES THAT THEY ARE MAKING
SINCERE EFFORTS IN THIS AREA, FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTED STANDARDS. TO FULLY
CATALOGUE A COLLECTION IN BOTH ENGLISH AND FRENCH WOULD BE WASTEFUL. THERE
SEEMS TO BE A TREND TOWARDS PARTICIPATION IN BILINGUAL AUTOMATED SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEMS.
CATALOGUING IN PUBLICATION' THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY AND THE NIGERIAN
PUBLISHERS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A SEMINAR ON CATALOGUING-IN-PUBLICATION, HELD DURING THE
4TH IFE BOOK FAIR, 5 MAR 79. OUTLINES THE MEANING OF A NATIONAL
CATALOGUING-IN-PUBLICATION PROGRAMME; ITS ADVANTAGES TO THE BOOK TRADE,
LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES, AND THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC AGENCY; AND
HOW SUCH A PROGRAMME COULD BE OPERATED IN NIGERIA.

PROBLEMS IN ESTABLISHING A NAME AUTHORITY FILE FOR NIGERIAN AUTHORS.
     
ESTABLISHING NAME AUTHORITY FILES IN SUCH MULTILINGUAL NATIONS AS NIGERIA IS
COMPLICATED BY THE EXISTENCE OF SOME 400 LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS, ALTHOUGH ONLY
ABOUT 15% OF THESE HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OR USED IN PUBLICATIONS; ENGLISH IS USED
AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND THE MEDIUM OF INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN TRIBES.
TRADITIONALLY, NIGERIANS HAVE BEEN KNOWN BY THEIR GIVEN NAMES DERIVED FROM 4
CATEGORIES' CIRCUMSTANCE OF BIRTH, RELIGION OF THE FAMILY CLAN, PROFESSION OF
THE FAMILY, AND HISTORY OF PREVIOUS BIRTHS. WITH THE INFLUENCE OF THE ENGLISH
AND OTHER EUROPEANS, ELEMENTS OF ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED

CATALOGUES AND A DECENTRALISED COMPUTER SYSTEM1' SWEDISH VIEWS ON A DANISH
REPORT.D
     
ISCUSSES A REPORT BY A DANISH WORKING PARTY ON CATALOGUE PRODUCTS, PUBLISHED
IN 1980, AND COMPARES THE DANISH AND SWEDISH SOLUTIONS. THE PROPOSED DANISH
SYSTEM CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A MIXTURE OF LIBRIS AND BUMS AND CONSIDERABLE
CENTRAL GUIDANCE BY THE LIBRARY CENTRE IS ASSUMED. THE WORKING PARTY SEEMS TO
HAVE LITTLE FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO CATALOGUE
ACCORDING TO THE NORMS, FOR IT PROPOSES THAT CENTRAL LIBRARIES HELP THE
SMALLER LIBRARIES WITH THE DECENTRALISED INPUT. THE COSTS OF THIS SYSTEM ARE,
HOWEVER, HIGH, AND THE SWEDISH SYSTEM, WHERE THE LIBRARY SERVICE CATALOGUES
FROM PHOTOCOPIED TITLE PAGES THOSE TITLES NOT FOUND IN THE CENTRAL DATA BASE,
IS PREFERABLE. CRITICISES THE REPORT FOR NOT CARRYING OUT ECONOMIC COSTING OF
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORT EXAGGERATES THE
COSTS OF PRODUCING LOCAL CATALOGUES IN PRINTED FORM AND NEGLECTS TO CONSIDER
USE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY, E.G. LASER PRINTERS, FOR THIS PRODUCTION.

AUTOMATING THE VERTICAL FILE INDEX.
     
THE BOYS TOWN CENTER'S LIBRARY SERVICES DIVISION MAINTAINS A SUBSTANTIAL
COLLECTION OF EPHEMERAL RESEARCH MATERIALS. EXTENSIVE SUBJECT INDEXING WAS
REQUIRED FOR OPTIMUM USE OF TIMELY DATA IN THE FILE. THROUGH COOPERATIVE
EFFORTS WITH A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, AN ON-LINE INDEXING SYSTEM WAS IMPLEMENTED
ON A LOCAL MINICOMPUTER. THE USER-ORIENTED SYSTEM HAS IMPROVED REFERENCE
SERVICES AND SERVES AS A PROTOTYPE FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE.

SECTION NATIONAL CATALOGUING SEMINAR, TO WHICH THIS ISSUE IS DEVOTED. IN OCT
79, THE AUSTRALIAN HEALTH DEPARTMENT LIBRARY CLOSED ITS CARD CATALOGUE AND
COMMENCED INPUT INTO HEMLOC-HEALTH AND MEDICAL LIBRARIES' ON-LINE CATALOGUE.
DISCUSSES INPUT, OUTPUT, AND BASIC CATALOGUING ASPECTS OF HEMLOC.
CONSIDERATIONS ON THE CASE FOR A SPECIFIC STANDARD FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF OLD
BOOKS.
     
EXAMINES IFLA'S DRAFT ISBD(A) OF NOV 78, NOTING DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES
WITH ISBD(M). CONCLUDES THAT A MORE SATISFACTORY SOLUTION WOULD BE TO PRODUCE
AN APPENDIX TO ISBD(M) PROVIDING FOR ALL CASES WHERE A LARGER MEASURE OF
DESCRIPTIVE DETAIL WAS APPROPRIATE.
UNIFORM TITLES' THEIR USE IN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING.
     
THIS STUDY OF THE VARIATION IN USE OF UNIFORM TITLES FROM ONE LIBRARY TO
ANOTHER AND EVEN WITHIN A CARD CATALOGUE, A PRACTICE SANCTIONED BY AACR,
EXAMINES THE VALIDITY OF THIS VARIATION IN USE OF UNIFORM TITLES, AND EXPLAINS
HOW A UNIFORM TITLE IS SELECTED AND ITS PREFERRED FORM IS DETERMINED. A
DISCUSSION OF THE DECISION TO USE A UNIFORM TITLE INCLUDES A DEFINITION AND
DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE UNIFORM TITLE CONCEPT. THE RELATION OF UNIFORM
TITLES TO THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CATALOGUE IS EXPLORED, WITH SAMPLE ENTRIES AS
ILLUSTRATIONS OF HOW UNIFORM TITLES CONTRIBUTE TO A LOGICAL, STRUCTURE
CATALOGUE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
A PROPOSAL FOR ACHIEVING UNIFORMITY IN THE CITATION OF INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS.
     
PROPOSAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF A STANDARD FOR THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CITATION OF INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS, WHICH WOULD FOSTER IMPROVED BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL BY ENSURING COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE CITATION. THE
INTENDED AUDIENCE FOR THE STANDARD WOULD BE AUTHORS, EDITORS, AND PUBLISHERS,
INCLUDING PRODUCERS OF INDEXES, ABSTRACTS AND SALES CATALOGUES.
THE FUNCTION OF THE LOCATION MARK IN LIBRARIES.
     
THE ROLE OF THE LOCATION MARK IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROCESSES IS EXAMINED
UNDER THE FOLLOWING HEADINGS' THE LOCATION MARK AS A KIND OF INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE; THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE LOCATION MARK; THE LOCATION
MARK IN THE PROCESSING AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION SOURCES (ACQUISITION,
STORAGE, AND RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS). THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LOCATION MARK IS
PARTICULARLY STRESSED FOR THOSE LIBRARIES THAT ARE PLANNING AUTOMATION.
HEINSIUS, KAYSER AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
NO HISTORICAL NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR GERMAN LITERATURE EXISTS; INSTEAD
GREAT IMPORTANCE IS PLACED ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORKS COMPILED BY HEINSIUS
AND KAYSER IN THE 18TH CENTURY. THESE ARE WIDELY USED AS REFERENCE
BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND THE VALIDITY OF THEIR ENTRIES IS RARELY QUESTIONED.
HEINSIUS AND KAYSER BASED THEIR CATALOGUES ON BIBLIOGRAPHIES PUBLISHED BY THE
BOOK TRADE SUCH AS EXHIBITION CATALOGUES. THESE WERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE AND DID
NOT INCLUDE REPRINTS OR NEW EDITIONS. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT
REFERENCES IN THE CATALOGUES AND A COMPLETE STUDY OF THE WORKS OF HEINSIUS AND
KAYSER IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS RELIABLE REFERENCE MATERIAL AND WHAT
IS NOT. A GUIDE TO USING THE CATALOGUES WHICH LISTED THE CHANGING
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE BOOK TRADE NOTING WHICH PUBLISHER WAS TAKEN OVER, BY WHOM
AND WHEN WOULD ALSO BE INVALUABLE IN THE WORK OF FOLLOWING UP BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
REFERENCES.
MICROCATALOGUES-A NEW FORM OF LIBRARY INFORMATION.
     
MICROCATALOGUES ARE BEING INTRODUCED INTO MANY LIBRARIES IN USA, UK,
SWITZERLAND AND WEST GERMANY. THEIR ADVANTAGES INCLUDE' SMALL SIZE; THE
POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ANY NUMBER OF COPIES; RELATIVELY SMALL COSTS AND SPEED
OF COPYING. THE USE OF MICROCATALOGUES DEMANDS A LARGE NUMBER OF USERS WHO
MUST BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THIS NEW FORM OF CATALOGUE SEARCHING.
MICROCATALOGUES ARE BEING TESTED IN ORDER TO LEARN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH
THEY ARE MOST EFFICIENT.
LOTKA'S LAW AND THE CATALOGUE?.
     
REPORTS AN ATTEMPT TO CORROBORATE W.G. POTTER'S WORK ON THE APPLICATION OF
LOTKA'S LAW TO THE FREQUENCY OF PERSONAL AUTHOR ENTRIES IN LIBRARY CATALOGUES
(2SEE1 81/579). CONCLUDES THAT THE FINDINGS SUPPORT POTTER'S SUGGESTIONS THAT
CATALOGUES OF LARGER LIBRARIES FIT LOTKA'S LAW MORE CLOSELY THAN THOSE OF
SMALLER LIBRARIES AND THAT THE LATTER HAVE A GREATER PROPORTION OF
SINGLE-ENTRY AUTHORS. DISCUSSES THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS.
AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH FOR STUDYING CORPORATE ENTRY IN CATALOGING.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY.) ALL ENTRIES IN A MONTH'S INPUT
INTO THE US NATIONAL UNION CATALOG WERE ANALYSED AND THE CORPORATE BODY
ENTRIES WERE ANALYSED IN GREATER DETAIL, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE APPLICATION OF
AACR 1 AND AACR 2. DISCUSSES THE INFORMATION THUS OBTAINED AND CONCLUDES THAT
THE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE CATALOGUE ITSELF SHOULD BE USED AS THE BASIS
FOR FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ON SOLVING CATALOGUING PROBLEMS.
ALPHABETIZATION IN INDEXES: EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES.
     
DISCUSSES THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE 'LETTER BY LETTER' AND 'WORD BY
WORD' SYSTEM OF ALPHABETISATION, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL STUDIES
OF HOW STUDENTS AND CHILDREN SEQUENCE WORDS AND RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM INDEXES
WITH DIFFERENT SEQUENCES. CONCLUDES THAT STUDENTS USE A VARIETY OF METHODS
WHEN ASKED TO PUT WORDS IN ORDER FOR AN INDEX, WITH SENSE AND MEANING BEING A
PRIME CONSIDERATION. SCHOOLCHILDREN, HOWEVER, WERE FOUND TO BE LESS AMBITIOUS
IN THIS RESPECT, AND TO ORDER WORDS ALPHABETICALLY USING THE LETTER BY LETTER
METHOD. NO 1 METHOD OF SEQUENCING INDEXES WAS FOUND TO LEAD TO BETTER
RETRIEVAL THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS USED, AND IT APPEARS THAT EITHER OF THE 2
METHODS CURRENTLY USED BY INDEXERS CAN BE EMPLOYED WITHOUT CAUSING UNDUE
DIFFICULTY FOR YOUNG READERS.
THE SHAPING OF CHINESE CATALOGUING RULES (IN CHINESE).
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT AND DRAFTING OF THE NEW CHINESE CATALOGUING RULES. THE
RULES ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL TYPES OF PRINT AND NON-PRINT MATERIAL, MEET THE
NEEDS OF LIBRARIES, INFORMATION CENTRES, AND ANY OTHER INSTITUTION, AND BE
USABLE IN BOOK, CARD, AND MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUES; DESCRIPTIONS ARE BASED
ON THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION FORMAT; CERTAIN
MERITORIOUS PARTS OF AACR2 AND THE 2NIPPON CATALOGUING RULES1 HAVE BEEN
ADOPTED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TAIWAN'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND CULTURAL TRADITION;
AND UNIMARC WAS CONSULTED. THE 1ST 2 CHAPTERS (GENERAL RULES AND DESCRIPTION
OF BOOKS) HAVE BEEN PRINTED.
LC'S CONCLUDING AACR2 INSTITUTE.
     
REPORTS ON AN INSTITUTE ON THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS'S INTERPRETATION AND
APPLICATION OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES, 2ND EDITION, SAN
FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, JUNE 81. THIS WAS THE LAST OF 14 'ROADSHOWS' ON THE
SUBJECT DESIGNED AND HELD BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS THROUGHOUT THE USA. THE
INSTITUTE COMPRISED 2 GENERAL SESSIONS AND 6 GROUP SESSIONS COVERING SPECIFIC
CHAPTERS OF AACR 2.
TRANSLATION AND ARABIZATION OF THE ANGLO AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (IN
ARABIC).
     
THE JORDAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARAB LEAGUE
EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL, AND SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION (ALECSO), HAS BEGUN THE
TRANSLATION AND ARABIZATION OF AACR 2 WHICH IT IS HOPED WILL BE FINISHED IN
MID 1982. THIS WILL BE A STEP TOWARDS THE STANDARDISATION OF CATALOGUING,
CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT HEADINGS, THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH HAS BEEN
EMPHASISED BY MANY LIBRARY CONFERENCES IN ARABIC COUNTRIES SINCE 1959. THE
TRANSLATED EDITION WILL INCLUDE ARABIC EXAMPLES, SUITABLE FOR THE ARAB WORLD,
IN ADDITION TO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEALING WITH PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THAT ARAB
CATALOGUERS AND BIBLIOGRAPHERS FACE.
FLC/FEDLINK AACR2 CATALOGING MANUAL FOR FEDERAL LIBRARIES.
     
THE MANUAL IS INTENDED TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AACR2. THE EMPHASIS IS
ON MATERIAL AND PROBLEMS LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED BY CATALOGUERS IN FEDERAL
AGENCY LIBRARIES. GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, TECHNICAL REPORTS, SERIALS,
MICROFORMS, AND MAPS ARE ADDRESSED. THE FOCUS IS ON DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING.
PLANNING FOR THE ADOPTION OF AACR2 AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE
LIBRARY (WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE SINGAPORE/MALAYSIA COLLECTION).
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE LAS/PPM JOINT CATALOGUING SEMINAR ON AACR2, 8-10 DEC
80. DISCUSSES THE RESPONSE OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE LIBRARY TO
THE 2ND EDITION OF THE 2ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES1, AND THE NEED FOR
MORE DETAILED PLANNING BEFORE FULL IMPLEMENTATION CAN BE ACHIEVED. A
QUANTITATIVE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF HEADING CHANGES
AFFECTING THE NUSL'S SINGAPORE/MALAYSIA COLLECTION CATALOGUE SAMPLE. DESCRIBES
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
RETROSPECTIVE CATALOGUE CONVERSION OF THE SINGAPORE/MALAYSIA COLLECTION
RECORDS INTO MACHINE-READABLE FORM.
AACR2 AND SERIALS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1980 LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA CATALOGUERS'
SECTION NATIONAL CATALOGUING SEMINAR, TO WHICH THIS ISSUE IS DEVOTED. BRIEFLY
DESCRIBES THE RULE CHANGES BETWEEN THE 1ST AND 2ND EDITIONS OF THE
ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES AND SUMMARISES THE RESULTANT PROBLEMS
CONCERNING SERIALS.
AACR2 AND MAPS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1980 LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA CATALOGUERS'
SECTION NATIONAL CATALOGUING SEMINAR, TO WHICH THIS ISSUE IS DEVOTED. THE
ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING COMMITTEE FOR CARTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS WAS FORMED IN
1979 AND IS PREPARING AN INTERPRETATIVE MANUAL OF MAP CATALOGUING, BUILT ON
CHAPTER 3 OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION) AND INCLUDING
ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES WHERE NECESSARY. OUTLINES THE MOTIVATION, PHILOSOPHY,
AND FORMAT OF THE MANUAL AND INDICATES THE MAJOR PROBLEM AREAS IN AACR 2 WHICH
HAVE REQUIRED AMPLIFICATION, INTERPRETATION, OR CORRECTION.
CATALOGING OF CARTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS.
     
DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANT NEW RULES IN THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES,
2ND EDITION, WHICH DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH MAPS. COVERS SOURCE OF INFORMATION,
TITLE, MATHEMATICAL DATA AREA, PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION, NOTES, ACCOMPANYING
MATERIAL, PUNCTUATION AND OTHER CHANGES.
THE EFFECT OF AACR2 ON SSAL.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1980 LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA CATALOGUERS'
SECTION NATIONAL CATALOGUING SEMINAR, TO WHICH THIS ISSUE IS DEVOTED. COMMENTS
ON THE CHANGES IN SSAL (SCIENTIFIC SERIALS IN AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES) AS A
RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION) IN
1981. IT IS HOPED TO KEEP THE 2SSAL SUPPLEMENT1 COMPLETELY CONSISTENT AS
REGARDS ENTRY POINT. THE MINOR CHANGES IN FORMS OF EXPRESSION SHOULD NOT
AFFECT CONTRIBUTORS OR USERS.
INDEXES AS ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE INDEXED MATERIAL (IN
HEBREW).
     
EXAMINES INDEXES AS A SOURCE OF GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDEXED
MATERIAL. DEFINES THE CONCEPTS OF INDEX-ENTRY, INDEX-BASE AND INDEX AND
CONCLUDES THAT AN INDEX IS A GROUP OF DATA AND SUBJECTS WHICH THE INDEXER
DEEMED SIGNIFICANT AND AS EXPRESSING THE CONTENT OF THE INDEXED MATERIAL.
GIVEN AN IDEAL INDEXER, THE SIZE OF AN INDEX MAY SERVE AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE INDEXING-BASE. SINCE PERFECT INDEXES DO NOT
EXIST, A CAREFUL EVALUATION OF A CONCORDANCE BY VOCABULARY SIZE AND WORD
OCCURRENCE COULD PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE. EVALUATION MUST BE DONE VERY CAREFULLY
IN RELATION TO CONTENT, DISCIPLINE AND TYPE OF INDEXED TERMS.
INTELLECTUAL ACCESS TO ARCHIVES' II. REPORT OF AN EXPERIMENT COMPARING
PROVENANCE AND CONTENT INDEXING METHODS OF SUBJECT RETRIEVAL.
     
2ND PART OF AN ARTICLE WHOSE 1ST PART APPEARED IN 2AMERICAN ARCHIVIST1 43 (1)
WINTER 80, WHICH DESCRIBED THE PROVENANCE AND CONTENT INDEXING METHODS OF
GAINING SUBJECT ACCESS TO ARTICLES. THE DESCRIPTIONS MADE PRECISE DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN THE METHODS, PRIMARILY TO DERIVE METHOD CHARACTERISTICS THAT COULD BE
FURTHER EXPLORED IN A RETRIEVAL EXPERIMENT. DESCRIBES THE EXPERIMENT, PRESENTS
ITS RESULTS, AND TRACES ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR ARCHIVAL SUBJECT RETRIEVAL
SYSTEMS. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY IS ALSO DISCUSSED.
HEADINGS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION' REPORT OF A SYDNEY WORKSHOP.
     
PRESENTS SUMMARIES OF PAPERS DELIVERED AT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA
NEW SOUTH WALES BRANCH'S LOCAL HISTORY WORKSHOP NO.5-SUBJECT INDEXING FOR
LOCAL HISTORY, HELD IN SYDNEY, 27 MAR 81. ALSO REPORTS THE PANEL DISCUSSIONS
AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WORKSHOP ATTENDEES.
NOTATION FOR INDEXING LANGUAGES AND CLASSIFICATIONS (IN GERMAN).
     
AN OVERVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE BASIC TYPES OF NOTATION THAT CAN BE DESIGNED.
INCLUDED ARE THE SEQUENTIAL (OR PURELY ORDINAL) NOTATIONS WITH HIERARCHICAL
LEVEL INDICATOR. IT IS SHOWN THAT LEFT ALIGNED SEQUENTIAL NOTATIONS ARE VERY
FLEXIBLE. THE EVALUATION OF NOTATIONS, CARRIED OUT WITH AN EXAMPLE, IS DONE
WITH A QUITE COMPREHENSIVE CATALOGUE OF DESIDERATA. FOR DESIGN DECISIONS, THE
METHODS OF WORTH ANALYSIS ARE RECOMMENDED, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER
OR NOT TO EMPLOY NOTATION AT ALL. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO USE NOTATIONAL
SYMBOLS ONLY FOR CERTAIN HIERARCHICAL LEVELS.
THE SEMANTIC PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATED SUBJECT HEADINGS.
     
STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE TRANSLATION OF SUBJECT HEADINGS FROM
ENGLISH INTO KOREAN. 4 DIFFERENT SEMANTIC ENTITIES ARE INVOLVED-THE ENGLISH OF
THE ORIGINAL LIST, THE CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS, AND THE KOREAN TRANSLATION LIST
WHICH MUST USE BOTH CHINESE IDEOGRAMS AND THE KOREAN ALPHABET. ULTIMATELY THE
CLASSIFICATION NUMBER SERVES AS THE MOST ACCURATE GUIDE TO THE SEMANTIC
CONTENT OF THE ORIGINAL TERM, AS WELL AS A GUIDE TO THE MOST SUITABLE TERM TO
EXPRESS THIS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ADAPTATION.
AN INDEXING SYSTEM' SWITCHING LANGUAGE FOR INTEGRATING AUTOMATED INFORMATION
NETWORKS.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO.) AN ACCOUNT OF THE BASIC
CONCEPTS, PROBLEM AREAS, AND OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND TECHNIQUES OF
SWITCHING LANGUAGES, CONCENTRATING PARTICULARLY ON THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
OF CLASSIFIED CONCEPT COORDINATE INDEXING AS PROVIDING THE NECESSARY SWITCHING
MECHANISM FOR INFORMATION TRANSFER IN A NETWORK. IT IS BASED ON A SYNTHESIS OF
PRE- AND POST-COORDINATE INDEXING AND ENABLES FREE COORDINATION OF DIVERSE
CONCEPTS, THROUGH KEYWORD INVERTED INDEXING BASED ON AN 2A PRIORI1 SET OF
CLASSES.
THE BROAD SYSTEM OF ORDERING' THE COMPILERS REPLY TO THEIR CRITICS.
     
REPLY ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF DOCUMENTATION/BROAD SYSTEM
OF ORDERING (FID/BSO) PANEL TO THE AUTHORS OF THE 5 REVIEW ARTICLES ON BSO,
2IBID1 4 (3) JULY 79 (2SEE1 80/4754-4758). COMPARES AND CONTRASTS THEIR
STATEMENTS AND GIVES THE PANEL'S RESPONSE TO EACH POINT RAISED BY THEM.
THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION AND MUSIC.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1980 LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA CATALOGUERS'
SECTION NATIONAL CATALOGUING SEMINAR, TO WHICH THIS ISSUE IS DEVOTED.
DESCRIBES THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION PHOENIX MUSIC SCHEDULE, DUE FOR
PUBLICATION IN LATE 1980. THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN USING THE NEW SCHEME'S 1975
DRAFT SINCE THAT YEAR FOR CLASSIFYING THE BOOKS AND PERIODICALS (BUT NOT
SCORES) IN SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE LIBRARY.
A CLASSIFICATION FOR LOCAL COLLECTIONS' AN APPEAL FOR COOPERATION.
     
IN COOPERATION WITH THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE, THE WORKING GROUP FOR
SPECIAL LIBRARIES HAS CONSULTED WITH ALL CONCERNED WITH LOCAL COLLECTIONS TO
PRODUCE A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME WHICH COULD BE USED THROUGHOUT WEST GERMANY.
THERE WILL BE A COMMON CORE TO THE SCHEME, BUT SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY TO
ACCOMODATE SPECIAL FACTORS, SUCH AS MOUNTAINOUS OR COASTAL AREAS. THE SCHEME
IS OUTLINED IN TABULAR FORM AND SHOWS 4 BROAD CATEGORIES DEVOTED TO HISTORY,
TOPOGRAPHY, ADMINISTRATION, BIOGRAPHIES AND FAMILY HISTORIES.
NOTATION IN CLASSIFICATION.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) EXAMINES THE FUNCTION OF THE NOTATIONAL SYSTEM IN A
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME, THE MANNER IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE FEATURES WHICH
DETERMINE THE MEASURE OF ITS SUCCESS OR FAILURE. CONSIDERS THE 5 MAJOR GENERAL
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES (UNIVERSAL DECIMAL, DEWEY DECIMAL, COLON, LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC).
PERMUTED MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS, 1982.
     
PERMUTED MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS, 1982, IS A COMPUTER-GENERATED DISPLAY OF
ALL TERMS, I.E. DESCRIPTORS AND CROSS-REFERENCES, IN THE ALPHABETIC LIST OF
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE'S MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS (MESH) FOR 1982,
AS WELL AS ALL CITATION TYPE, CHECK TAG, AND GEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTORS IN THE
ANNOTATED ALPHABETIC MESH, 1982. THE PERMUTED MESH TAKES EACH SIGNIFICANT WORD
THAT APPEARS IN EACH MESH TERM AND THEN LISTS ALL THE MESH TERMS IN WHICH THAT
WORD APPEARS.
MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS' TREE STRUCTURES, 1982.
     
ALL MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS CURRENTLY IN USE BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
MEDICINE'S INDEXERS, CATALOGUERS, AND SEARCHERS ARE ARRANGED IN A HIERARCHICAL
MANNER SHOWING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BROADER AND NARROWER TERMS.
SUBJECT HEADINGS FOR AUSTRALIA' A FRESH OVERVIEW.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1980 LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA CATALOGUERS'
SECTION NATIONAL CATALOGUING SEMINAR, TO WHICH THIS ISSUE IS DEVOTED. THE
AUTHOR OF LIST OF AUSTRALIAN SUBJECT HEADINGS (LASH) EXPLORES THE BACKGROUND
OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADINGS (LCSH) TO EXPLAIN WHY LASH WAS NEEDED
AND DISCUSSES HOW LCSH AND LASH ARE RELATED, EXPLAINING THAT LASH IS ALL ABOUT
SUBJECT HEADINGS IN THE AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
SOFTWARE FOR PRINTED INDEXES' A GUIDE.
     
A DESCRIPTIVE GUIDE TO SOFTWARE PACKAGES FOR PRINTED, OR PAGE-FORMAT, INDEX
PRODUCTION, GIVING DETAILS OF SUPPLIER, COMPUTER AND LANGUAGES TO BE USED,
MEMORY REQUIREMENTS, INPUT AND OUTPUT (INCLUDING INDEXER AIDS), COST, NUMBER
OF USERS, BIBLIOGRAPHY, AND A CONTACT ADDRESS. IT WAS COMPILED TO ENABLE
POTENTIAL INDEX PRODUCERS TO ACQUAINT THEMSELVES WITH EXISTING PACKAGES AND TO
COMPARE THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS WITH PACKAGE CAPABILITIES BEFORE APPROACHING A
SOFTWARE HOUSE FOR A CUSTOM-MADE PACKAGE.
AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF THREE SUBJECT ACCESS SYSTEMS IN MEDICINE' LCSH, MESH,
PRECIS.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH). EXAMINES THE SEE ALSO REFERENCE
STRUCTURES (SYNDETIC STRUCTURES) OF 3 SUBJECT ACCESS SYSTEMS USED IN
MEDICINE-PRECIS, MESH, AND LCSH. EXPLORES THEIR DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES
IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE BEST POSSIBLE STRUCTURE USING FEATURES OF ALL 3. 3
VARIABLES WERE EVALUATED-SUBJECT AREA COVERAGE, BROWSEABILITY, AND
FLEXIBILITY. MAPS WERE DEVELOPED FOR THE SUBJECT HEADINGS IN EACH SYSTEM AND
COMPARED WITH MAPS DEVELOPED FROM RECOGNISED 'CLASSIC' TEXTBOOKS; THIS
PROCEDURE READILY IDENTIFIED GAPS IN COVERAGE AND INCONSISTENCIES IN
TERMINOLOGY CONTROL. SUCH MAPS COULD BE CONVERTED TO COMPUTER DISPLAYS TO
IMPROVE PRECISION AND RECALL IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE SEARCHING.
FINAL REPORT OF THE PRECIS/TRANSLINGUAL PROJECT.
     
THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING PRECIS WITH EXTRA FACILITIES TO ENABLE IT TO
FUNCTION AS A SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING INDEXING DATA BETWEEN 2 OR MORE NATURAL
LANGUAGES WAS INVESTIGATED. LEXICONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 3 LANGUAGES, AND A
'PIVOT FILE' CREATED TO LINK THEM. ROUTINES FOR SWITCHING INDEXING TERMS OUT
OF A GIVEN SOURCE LANGUAGE AND INTO A CHOSEN TARGET LANGUAGE WERE DEVISED AND
SET DOWN IN THE FORM OF FLOW-CHARTS OR ALGORITHMS. USING THESE ALGORITHMS,
PRECIS STRINGS WERE SWITCHED MAINLY BETWEEN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN.
PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION WERE SOLVED BY THE USE OF 'LEXICAL BLOCKS' AND THE
ADOPTION OF A SYSTEM OF CATEGORIES. MECHANISMS FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROVISION OF
ARTICLES IN FRENCH AND GERMAN STRINGS WERE DESIGNED. 2 METHODS OF PROVIDING
INFLECTED FORMS OF NOUNS BY ALGORITHM WERE TESTED IN GERMAN AND POLISH. THE
USE OF 'SUBSTITUTE' PHRASES IN PRECIS WAS INVESTIGATED, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE
AUTOMATIC PROVISION AND CONSTRUCTION OF PHRASES IN A TARGET LANGUAGE WERE
DEVISED. ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO BUILD PREPOSITIONAL OR ADJECTIVAL PHRASES WERE
TESTED ON ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN PRECIS STRINGS.
PROBLEMS IN IMPROVING CLASS IN CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETINS WITHIN VINITI'S
INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
DESCRIBES THE SUBJECT HEADINGS IN VINITI'S CURRENT AWARENESS INFORMATION
BULLETIN AND ANALYSES THESE FOR AUTOMATICS AND RADIOELECTRONICS, BIOLOGY,
METALLURGY, PHYSICS, AND CHEMISTRY. DISCUSSES THEIR DIFFERENCES AND
SIMILARITIES AND COMPARES THE CLASSIFICATION IN THE BULLETIN AND MAKES
PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
INFORMATION PROCESSING IN INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS.
     
DISCUSSES A THESIS BY J. LUEF' STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION IN
INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS, PRESENTED TO THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY. THE PROBLEM
OF HOW KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR SELECTION OF MATERIAL FOR
CONSTRUCTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED IN DATA FORM IS NOW
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED WITH THE CREATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF
SCIENTIFIC UNIONS' COMMITTEE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DATA. LUEF
DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN RETRIEVAL OF REFERENCES AND OF DATA; VERY DETAILED
SPECIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL OBJECTS SO THAT THEY CAN BE
REFERRED TO IN A SYSTEM. HE STUDIES THE AREA OF ANTICIPATIVE INTELLIGENCE,
I.E. THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING NEW SOLUTIONS TO A PROBLEM AND THEREBY
INCREASE INNOVATION WITHIN THE FIRM. THE THEORETICAL DISCUSSIONS ARE SOUNDLY
BASED ON PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND HE REGARDS THE PROCESS OF RETRIEVAL AS A
TOOL TO BE USED BY THE DECISION-MAKER. THE THESIS HAS SECTIONS ON SOFTWARE AND
 HARDWARE, INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF THE ROLE OF MAN IN THE SEARCH PROCESS. THE
2ND PART CONCERNS PRACTICAL SYSTEM DESIGN IN 4 CONCERNS AND DESCRIPTION OF A
DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM DART (DATA ANALYSIS, RETRIEVAL AND TAXONOMY), WITH
COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.
MASS STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AND FILE ORGANIZATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARY AUTOMATION,
TAIPEI, TAIWAN, 14-19 FEB 81. CONSIDERS THE RAPID EVOLUTION OF MASS STORAGE
TECHNOLOGY AND ITS INFLUENCE ON FILE ORGANISATION. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE
MADE WHAT SEEMED IMPRACTICAL IN 1971 BECOME EMINENTLY PRACTICAL IN 1981 AND
LIBRARIANS MUST THUS EXAMINE THE TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT TO DETERMINE WHICH
OF THEIR PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS ARE REAL AND WHICH ARE ILLUSORY AND SOON TO BE
SMASHED. THIS EXAMINATION IS PERHAPS MOST ESSENTIAL FOR MASS STORAGE FILE
ORGANISATION AS THIS HAS THE MOST MARKED AND LONG-LASTING EFFECT ON THE
PERFORMANCE OF AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS.
REDUCING BLOCK ACCESSES IN INVERTED FILES BY PARTIAL CLUSTERING.
     
THE RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION FROM AN INVERTED FILE REQUIRES ACCESS TO BOTH
INDEX AND DATA BLOCKS. HEURISTIC TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DATA BLOCK
ACCESSES ARE PRESENTED, AND CAN BE REORGANISED CONCURRENTLY WITH NORMAL USER
ACTIVITIES. PREVIOUS WORK ON INTERRELATED RECORD CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES IS
DESCRIBED. METHODS FOR THE PARTIAL REORGANISATION OF DATA FILES ARE DESCRIBED
AND COMPARED WITH THE TOTAL SORT METHOD, USING AN ARTIFICIAL RANDOMLY
GENERATED FILE. METHODS DESCRIBED ARE SORTING IN ORDER OF THE CATENATED KEY
FORMED FROM THE ATTIBUTES, REORDERING A SET OF ADJACENT BLOCKS, AND THE LOCAL
OPTIMUM, PARTIAL SORT AND CARE METHODS FOR SELECTING THE CLUSTER; SORTING GAVE
THE BEST RESULTS, BUT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ON-LINE REORGANISATION. PARTIAL
METHODS FAVOUR AN INCREASE IN THE BUFFER SIZE, AND THE DISTANCE FUNCTION IS
MORE EFFECTIVE FOR SELECTING A CLUSTER, WHERE THE ATTRIBUTES HAVE MANY VALUES.
STUDY OF MESSAGE TEXT FORMATS' BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH QUERIES.
     
PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE SEARCH QUERY ARGUMENTS OF SEVERAL MAJOR
BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES AND SHOWS THE COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF THE
QUERY STRUCTURE AMONG THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS. THE REPORT ILLUSTRATES A SYMBOLIC
META-LANGUAGE THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO DESCRIBE AND COMPARE THE SEARCH ARGUMENTS.
IN ADDITION, STATUS AND ERROR MESSAGES USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SEARCH QUERIES
THAT SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LIBRARIES AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE (NCLIS), NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS (NBS) APPLICATIONS

CORPORATE INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN TRANSITION' CALL FOR INDUSTRY RESPONSIVENESS.
     
DATA BASE PUBLISHERS ARE IN A POSITION TO ASSIST CORPORATE USERS IN THEIR
TRANSITION INTO THE FUTURE BY PROVIDING SERVICES WHICH SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE
ON-LINE SYSTEMS WITH THE LARGER INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WHILE MANY CORPORATIONS
HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, A
MAJORITY HAVE NOT. ON-LINE SYSTEMS OFFER A CORPORATION THE MEANS FOR QUICKLY
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, AND INTRODUCE FLEXIBILITY TO CORPORATE INFORMATION
CENTRES, THUS PROVIDING THE 1ST STEP TO A FULLY INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
THE CONGRESSIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE HAS RECENTLY SURVEYED CORPORATE USERS TO
DETERMINE THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
IS THERE A FUTURE FOR THE END USER IN ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING?.
     
AS ACCESS TO COMPUTER TERMINALS BECOMES AN EVERYDAY REALITY, MANY END USERS,
PARTICULARLY THOSE IN RESEARCH, WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ATTEMPT TO PERFORM THEIR OWN
ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHES. REGARDLESS OF THE CONCERNS OF LIBRARIANS
REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SEARCH,
THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY EDUCATORS WILL HAVE TO FACE.
THE CONCERNS AND PROBLEMS OF END USER SEARCHING ARE DISCUSSED, NEW
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF ON-LINE ACCESS ARE REVIEWED, AND SOME
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MEETING THE CHALLENGE THROUGH EDUCATION ARE DISCUSSED.
USER FEEDBACK-INFLUENCE ON ONLINE SYSTEM OPERATORS.
     
FOR AN ABSTRACT 2SEE1 80/4816. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
DEVELOPMENTS IN OPTICAL DISC TECHNOLOGY AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION
STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL.
     
BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE AUTHOR'S 1-MONTH VISIT TO THE USA IN APR-MAY 80
AND A SUBSEQUENT BRIEF VISIT TO PHILIPS DATA SYSTEMS IN THE NETHERLANDS,
DURING WHICH HE DISCUSSED OPTICAL DISCS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND PROSPECTIVE
USERS. INDICATES THAT PROSPECTS FOR THE USE OF OPTICAL DISCS IN TEXTUAL AND
GRAPHICAL INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL ARE GOOD. THERE ARE APPLICATIONS
FOR REPLICATED VIDEO DISCS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY CAN BE MASTERED WITH DIGITALLY
CODED INFORMATION, BUT THE MAJOR IMPACT WILL COME WITH THE DIGITAL OPTICAL
RECORDING SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE 'READ AND WRITE' FACILITIES.
A VIDEODISC INTERFACE UNIT.
     
THE LISTER HILL NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS OF THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY OF MEDICINE HAS DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE MICROPROCESSOR BASED VIDEODISC
INTERFACE UNIT (VIU). THE VIU ENABLES A HIGH-LEVEL COMPUTER CONTROL OF THE MCA
INDUSTRIAL VIDEODISC PLAYER FOR A HOST PROCESSOR OR TERMINAL (2SEE ALSO1 NEXT
ABSTRACT).

PRICING OF INFORMATION.
     
CONSIDERS THE COST OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BY DATA BASES AND INFORMATION
CENTRES, AND EXPLORES THE NEED TO CHARGE USERS FOR THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED.
THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF 3 MEANS OF CHARGING USERS ARE DISCUSSED'
(1) CONNECT HOUR CHARGE, (2) PRINT/TYPE CHARGE, AND (3) SUBSCRIPTION. ALSO
ADDRESSED IS THE PRACTICE OF MARKETING MAGNETIC TAPES TO DATA BASE USERS WHO
WISH TO SEARCH THE INFORMATION IN-HOUSE RATHER THAN THROUGH ON-LINE VENDORS.
THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT DATA BASE PRODUCERS SHOULD DEVELOP COHERENT PRICING
POLICIES, AND THAT INFORMATION BE MARKETED AT A PRICE DEPENDENT ON THE COST OF
PROVIDING IT. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
DATABASE COMMUNICATION IN A HETEROGENOUS DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NETWORK.
     
AN ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH IS OUTLINED, TO FULFIL THE NEED FOR AN INTEGRATED
DATA BASE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ABLE TO SUPPORT ANY USER IN ANY NETWORK NODE,
WITHOUT INCURRING MASS MIGRATION OF DATA. A GLOBAL QUERY TRANSLATOR PROCESSES
QUERIES INTO A GLOBAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF INFORMATION CONTENT, AND A GLOBAL
INTERNAL MODEL OF DATA TO FORM AN ACCESS-PATH ORIENTED MODEL OF THE STRUCTURE
OF THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM. SUB-QUERIES ARE FORMED USING A QUERY DECOMPOSER AND
ACCESS PATH SELECTORS, AND ARE TRANSLATED INTO THE DATA BASE LANGUAGE. THE
ROLE OF LAYERS AND MAPPINGS IN THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE IS DEFINED BETWEEN
THE VIRTUAL MODEL AND THE LOCAL PHYSICAL DATA BASE. THE ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP
AND DIAM-SDDT MODELS ARE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH GENERAL DATA BASE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. AN EXAMPLE OF AN INTEGRATED NETWORK HETEROGENOUS DATA BASE
IS FOLLOWED BY A DESCRIPTION OF INTER-DATA BASE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE UNIFIED
GLOBAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL.
ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT UTILIZING ON-LINE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES AND ON-LINE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS.
     
WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN A STUDY BY THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND ON THE USE OF CABLE
TELEVISION (CATV) TO SERVE PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND GOVERNMENT NEEDS IS
REPORTED. THE STUDY IS PART OF AN OVERALL PROJECT TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE
DELIVERY OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND TO
EXPLORE THE ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES AIMED AT IMPROVING COMMUNICATIONS AMONG
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL INNOVATION NETWORK (NIN) AND BETWEEN NIN AND MEMBERS
OF THE FEDERAL LABORATORY CONSORTIUM. DISCUSSES DEVELOPMENT OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION SERVICES, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION, AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE
USE OF CATV IN RHODE ISLAND.
THE PTT IN THE EUROPEAN DATA NETWORK (IN GERMAN).
     
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SWISS POST-, TELEFON- UND TELEGRAFENBETRIEBE (I.E. POST
OFFICE) WITHIN THE EUROPEAN DATA TRANSMISSION NETWORK ARE DISCUSSED. THE
BACKGROUND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EURONET DIANE IS CONSIDERED. EQUIPMENT
NECESSARY TO LINK UP WITH THE NETWORK IS IDENTIFIED AS WELL AS THE METHOD OF
COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE WITH THE SERVICE. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PRINTING
INDUSTRY ARE DISCUSSED.
INFORMATION PROCESSING NETWORKS IN INTERNATIONAL BANKING.
     
DURING THE PAST DECADE THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING CONCERN OVER THE SOCIAL,
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
NETWORKS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 LEVELS OF SUCH
NETWORKS, EACH WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASINGLY GREATER SOCIAL OR
ORGANISATIONAL IMPACT. BASED ON THAT CATEGORISATION, INTERNATIONAL BANKING WAS
CHOSEN AS THE FOCUS FOR AN ATTITUDE SURVEY CONCERNING THE PERCEIVED EFFECTS
AMONG BANKERS OF USING INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT TELEX IS
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR DAILY INTERNATIONAL BANKING OPERATIONS THAN COMPUTER
NETWORKS, ALTHOUGH WITHIN 6 YEARS COMPUTER NETWORKS ARE EXPECTED TO REPLACE
TELEX IN IMPORTANCE.
DESIGNING A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION DATA TRANSMISSION NETWORK.
     
DISCUSSES THE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR A DATA TRANSMISSION NETWORK TO FACILITATE
EFFECTIVE RESOURCE SHARING AMONG COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION CENTRES; PRESENTS
A NETWORK STRUCTURE WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A PACKET-SWITCHING
COMMUNICATION NETWORK; AND DESCRIBES MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF DATA TRANSMISSION
NETWORK LINKS.
THE VIDEOTEX MARKETPLACE. A THEORY OF EVOLUTION.
     
EXAMINES FACTORS WHICH WILL INFLUENCE THE APPLICATION OF VIDEOTEX (PRESTEL,
ETC.) IN BUSINESS. POTENTIAL MARKET SIZE IS ASSESSED AND 4 POSSIBLE MARKET
SCENARIOS ARE OUTLINED. ARGUES THAT A MASS MARKET FOR VIDEOTEX USE BY THE
GENERAL POPULATION WILL EVOLVE FROM A FEW CAREFULLY CHOSEN BUSINESS
APPLICATIONS (INCLUDING PLACING TERMINALS IN PUBLIC PLACES).
THE NEW MEDIA AND THE PRESS' EXPERIENCES AND EXPECTATIONS IN THE USA (IN
GERMAN).
     
THE IMPACT OF VIEWDATA AND CABLE TV SYSTEMS IN THE USA IS CONSIDERED. IT IS
FELT THAT THESE NEW MEDIA REPRESENT MORE OF A THREAT TO TV AND RADIO SERVICES
THAN TO NEWSPAPERS, ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF MAGAZINES AND JOURNALS IN A
PERIOD OF ECONOMIC STAGNATION IS NOT FELT TO BE SO CERTAIN.
THE FUTURE OF PRESTEL' THROUGH THE GATEWAY.
     
THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC PRESTEL SERVICE IN THE UK IS DISCUSED. THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF PRESTEL ARE DESCRIBED AND ITS PRESENT POSITION IN RELATION
TO BUSINESS AND DOMESTIC USE IS EXAMINED. THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE
PRESTEL SERVICE ARE REVIEWED AND THE MAIN FACTORS INFLUENCING PRESTEL'S FUTURE

AND A DISSERVICE TO READERS.

REPORT OF A STUDY UNDERTAKEN BY THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION COMMITTEE OF THE
ROYAL SOCIETY. THE MAJOR CONCLUSION IS THAT A COMBINATION OF PRESSURES WILL
VERY SOON PUT THE UK'S SCHOLARLY SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION SYSTEM UNDER
CONSIDERABLE STRAIN. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE EXTRA FUNDING. 2 MAIN
POSSIBILITIES ARE A SUBSIDY OF PUBLICATIONS AND INCREASED PROVISION FOR
LIBRARIES (ENABLING THEM TO PURCHASE A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS AND
THUS ALSO GENERATING INCOME FOR THE PUBLISHERS).
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES.
     
A STUDY OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES FOR 1967-79 IS
PRESENTED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE JOURNALS ARE COMPARABLE IN COST TO PHYSICS
AND CHEMISTRY JOURNALS, PREVIOUSLY FOUND MOST COSTLY. WHEN WEIGHTED AVERAGES
ARE COMPARED, THESE JOURNALS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR WHICH PRICE DATA ARE
AVAILABLE IN THE USA. A SMALL NUMBER OF HIGHLY CITED JOURNALS ACCOUNT FOR
NEARLY 50% OF THE COST OF THE ENTIRE LIST OF 83 JOURNALS STUDIED-A FACT WHICH
HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF JOURNAL COLLECTIONS. THE NEED
FOR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES FOR THE PURCHASE OF SCIENTIFIC
JOURNALS IS REITERATED.
DUAL PRICING OF HEALTH SCIENCES PERIODICALS' A SURVEY.
     
A SURVEY OF DUAL PRICING PRACTICES AMONG PUBLISHERS OF HEALTH-RELATED JOURNALS
IDENTIFIED 281 PERIODICALS WITH AN AVERAGE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL OF OVER 100%
BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION RATES. BOTH THE PRACTICE
ITSELF AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL ARE INCREASING, INDICATING THAT
JOURNAL SUBSCRIPTIONS OF HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES INCREASINGLY PROVIDE THE
NECESSARY FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLICATION OF HEALTH SCIENCES JOURNALS.
DUAL PRICING IS ALSO CORRELATED WITH COPYRIGHT ROYALTIES. PROBLEMS CREATED FOR
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES' BUDGETS BY DUAL PRICING ARE PARTLY DUE TO
UNCRITICAL PURCHASING BY LIBRARIES. RECOMMENDS INCREASED CONSUMERISM ON THE
PART OF HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIANS.
REPORT' TRAINING SEMINAR ON BOOK DESIGN AND ILLUSTRATION 1980.
     
THE SEMINAR, JOINTLY ORGANISED BY THE COUNCIL AND THE ASSOCIATION OF
PUBLISHERS AND BOOKSELLERS OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY, WAS HELD FROM
29 AUG TO 2 SEPT 80. PRESENTS PAPERS AND ADDRESSES FROM THE SEMINAR, ARRANGED
TO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF PACKAGING BOOKS ATTRACTIVELY IN SINGAPORE, WHERE THE
READING HABIT IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED.
UNIVERSITY PRESS BOOKS IN THE CLASSROOM.
     
REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER DELIVERED TO A SESSION ENTITLED 'MARKETING THE
COURSE-RELATED BOOK' AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY PRESSES, SAN FRANCISCO, 30 MAY 81. CONSIDERS THE PROBLEMS AND
OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNIVERSITY PRESS BOOKS IN UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES. WHILE PRICE
IS INCREASINGLY CRUCIAL, GREATER EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON PUBLISHING
OUTSTANDING BOOKS WHICH MAY BECOME CLASSICS.
BA CONFERENCE '81.
     
DESCRIBES THE SESSION ON MARKETING AT THE BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION (UK) ANNUAL
CONFERENCE. TOPICS INCLUDED' THE INDIVIDUALITY OF BOOKSHOPS; UNWIN'S TRAINING
CENTRE; THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL BOOK LEAGUE; THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRADE; THE
GIFT MARKET; BOOK TOKENS; ADVERTISING; SMALL ORDERS; AND WHOLESALING.
THE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH LITERATURE.
     
THE INSTITUTE, THE 1ST OF ITS KIND IN SOUTH AFRICA, WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE
POTCHEFSTROOM UNIVERSITY FOR CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION IN 1979. IT IS
INTERDISCIPLINARY, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND FACULTIES
SERVE ON ITS BOARD OF CONTROL. IT WILL FUNCTION AS A NATIONAL SERVICE
ORGANISATION, PROMOTING AND COORDINATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THIS
FIELD, ACTING AS A RESEARCH CENTRE AND CLEARINGHOUSE FOR LOCAL AND OVERSEAS
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WITH A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION OF CHILDREN'S AND
YOUTH LITERATURE AND STUDY MATERIAL TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES. SOME OF ITS
VARIED ACTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED.
THE DANISH PUBLISHING WORLD ABROAD OR THE CHILDREN'S BOOK FAIR IN BOLOGNA 1981.
     
THE 1981 FAIR ILLUSTRATED THE MISERABLE NATURE OF PRESENT-DAY PUBLISHING BUT
WAS A TRUE PICTURE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, 80% OF WHICH CONSISTS OF COMICS,
PICTURE-BOOKS AND COLOURED BOOKS, ALL IN POOR TASTE. CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN
GENERAL ARE AT A LOW LEVEL-THE TV SCREEN IN BOOK FORM-AND THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER COLOURS AND PICTURES SELL WHEREAS CULTURE DOES NOT. SCANDINAVIAN BOOK
PRODUCTION DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN VARIETY, BREADTH
AND WELL-DEFINED TASTE BUT IS IN AN OBVIOUSLY SCANDINAVIAN STYLE. THE 1981
BOLOGNA FAIR WAS DULL, WITH LITTLE NEW OR OUTSTANDINGLY INTERESTING, AND
BUSINESS ALSO APPEARED TO BE POOR AND MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH JOINT
BOOK-PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. JOINT PRODUCTION ENABLES DANISH
PUBLISHERS TO ISSUE QUALITY PICTURE BOOKS BUT ALSO HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME THE
MEANS BY WHICH DANISH BOOKS CAN APPEAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
BUT THE BOOKSELLER CAN STILL PREVENT THE TRAGEDY.INT
     
ERVIEWS THE PUBLISHER HENRIK BORBERG ABOUT THE DECLINE IN THE BOOKTRADE AND
HOW TO ARREST IT. BOOKSHOPS SHOULD INSTALL COMPUTER TERMINALS FROM WHICH
CUSTOMERS, FOR PAYMENT, COULD FIND THE INFORMATION WHICH WILL ANSWER THEIR
QUERIES. BOOKSELLERS MUST REALISE THAT THEY ARE INFORMATION PROVIDERS AND
SHOULD BE WILLING TO HANDLE THE INFORMATION SERVICES NOW BEING PUBLISHED BY
MANY SECTIONS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE AND ALSO OTHER PUBLICATIONS NOW NOT
NORMALLY FOUND IN BOOKSHOPS. DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRONIC BOOK, OR
'POCKET READER'. THIS MEDIUM WILL BE ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR SMALL EDITION
PUBLICATIONS, RESERVING PRINTING FOR LARGE EDITIONS NOW ALREADY BEING SOLD IN
SUPERMARKETS. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD SECURE THIS TRADE, OTHERWISE RADIO DEALERS
AND RECORD SHOPS WILL CAPTURE IT.
BUILDING THE FEDERATION.
     
THE FEDERATION OF RADICAL BOOKSELLERS (FORMERLY THE FEDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE
BOOKSELLERS) IS AN ORGANISATION FORMED BY ABOUT 40 UK RADICAL AND COMMUNITY
BOOKSHOPS. DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION, AIMS AND MEMBERSHIPS OF THE FEDERATION
WHICH, IN 1981 IS WIDENING ITS SCOPE TO INCLUDE SHOPS AFFILIATED TO POLITICAL
PARTIES OR OTHER GROUPS. A LIST OF THE FEDERATION'S BOOKSHOP MEMBERS AND THEIR
ADDRESSES IS APPENDED.
TECHNICAL WRITING' PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE.
     
NO ABSTRACT AVAILABLE.
DOLLARS-AND-CENTS VALUE OF EFFICIENT PRESENTATION. A PLEA FOR THE RETENTION OF
THE WELL-PRODUCED PRIMARY JOURNAL.
     
ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE, WITH THE HELP OF A SIMPLE ECONOMIC MODEL, THAT THE
PRESENT TREND TOWARD LOW-COST AND LOW-QUALITY PUBLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC WORK
MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PUBLISHER BUT HARMFUL TO THE COMMUNITY AS
A WHOLE.
EXCERPTS FROM MY BOUBOULINA FILE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN A TEXTBOOK AUTHOR'S AGREEING TO ALLOW STICKERS TO BE PLACED OVER
PORTIONS OF HER BOOK FOUND OBJECTIONABLE BY A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND A
SUCCESSFUL WRITER'S AGREEING TO EXPURGATE PORTIONS OF HIS NOVEL TO CUT COSTS.
EXAMINES THESE DIFFERENCES BY TRACING THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF CENSORSHIP WITH
WHICH AUTHORS MUST DEAL FROM ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN AN AUTHOR ON 1 SIDE AND
EDITORS, PUBLISHERS, TEACHERS, AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ON THE OTHER.
EXAMPLES FROM EACH LINK IN THE CHAIN ARE ILLUSTRATED WITH EXCERPTS FROM THE
AUTHOR'S PERSONAL FILE ON CENSORSHIP, CALLED 'BOUBOULINA'.
INTERNATIONALISM' AND THE CHILDREN'S LITERATURE COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED
STATES: A SECOND LOOK.P
     
APER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TERM
'INTERNATIONALISM' AS IT IS USED BY THOSE IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IN THE USA. IT IS MOST COMMONLY APPLIED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH
CENTRE ON SOME PHASE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. ITS USE
APPEARS WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN ARTICLES ON CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND
SEMINAR PROGRAMMES. EXAMINATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE TEXTBOOKS, THEMES FOR
DOCTORAL THESES PRESENTED 1930-79, AND THE STATUS OF LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS IN
GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF EDUCATION INDICATE THAT THE
INTERNATIONALISM OF THE FIELD IS INCLINED TO BE SUPERFICIAL.
INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S CENTRE.
     
DISCUSSES THE FOUNDATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S CENTRE IN PARIS IN
1949 AND ENUMERATES ITS AIMS AND OBJECTIVES. DESCRIBES ITS PRESENT ACTIVITIES
WHICH INCLUDE TRAINING AND INFORMATION, DOCUMENTATION AND PUBLICATIONS, AND
RESEARCH. DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT BODIES WHICH SUPPORT THE CENTRE'S
ACTIVITIES.
TRENDS IN AMERICAN ATLAS CARTOGRAPHY.
     
NOTES THAT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON US ATLASES, POSSIBLY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE, THROUGHOUT THEIR HISTORY, BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE INFERIOR TO
EUROPEAN ONES, AND PRESENTS A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF TRENDS IN US ATLAS
CARTOGRAPHY FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE REPUBLIC TO THE PRESENT. IDENTIFIES
A NUMBER OF DISTINCTIVE PERIODS IN THE HISTORY OF US ATLAS CARTOGRAPHY, AND
DESCRIBES THE CHARACTERISTIC FORM OF THE ATLASES PRODUCED IN EACH OF THESE
PERIODS.
PLR: DRAFT OF THE DRAFT SCHEME.
     
ASSESSES THE PROPOSALS FOR A PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR) SCHEME ISSUED BY THE
UK MINISTER FOR THE ARTS ON 24 JULY 81. THE PROPOSALS ARE A DRAFT OF THE DRAFT
SCHEME WHICH, AFTER CONSULTATIONS, WILL REACH PARLIAMENT IN LATE AUTUMN 81.
UNDER THE SCHEME, ELIGIBLE AUTHORS (WHO MUST BE REGISTERED) WILL RECEIVE
PAYMENT FROM A CENTRAL REGISTRAR. THE AMOUNT PAYABLE WILL BE CALCULATED BY
ANALYSING THE LOANS OF 16 LIBRARIES AND EXTRAPOLATING THE RESULTS TO OBTAIN
FIGURES FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. A RATE OF 1/2 P/LOAN IS ESTIMATED. DISCUSSES
THE RAMIFICATIONS CONCERNING PAYMENT LIMITS (UPPER AND LOWER).
TRAINING, RESEARCHING AND LEARNING WITH VIDEODISC.
     
THE POTENTIAL OF THE VIDEODISC AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL IS DISCUSSED. THE BASIC
CONCEPT OF VIDEODISCS IS EXPLAINED, SHOWING HOW THEY ARE USED, AS ARE THEIR
PRINCIPAL FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER RECORDING SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY
VIDEOTAPE. THE APPLICATIONS FOR VIDEODISCS IN EDUCATION ARE CONSIDERED IN SOME
DETAIL, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN.
THE SLIPPERY MARKET FOR VIDEODISCS.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, SALES, PRICES AND PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF THE RCA
SELECTAVISION VIDEODISC PLAYER ARE COMPARED WITH THE PIONEER AND MAGNAVOX
MACHINES. COMPETITION FROM VIDEO-CASSETTE RECORDERS IS DISCUSSED AND THE
TYPICAL KIND OF CUSTOMER FOR EACH IS CONSIDERED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RENTAL
MARKET FOR CASSETTES AND DISCS ARE DESCRIBED. JAPANESE DEVELOPMENT OF DISC
PLAYERS AND CASSETTE SYSTEMS IS CONSIDERED AND THEIR VIDEO COLOUR CAMERAS ARE
DISCUSSED. WHETHER RCA WILL RECOVER ITS DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE
VIDEODISC-PLAYER IS ALSO EXAMINED.
VIDEO DISC FOR THE STORAGE OF OFFICE DOCUMENTS AND ENGINEERING GRAPHICS.
     
A DESCRIPTION OF THE OPTICAL DATA DISC, A MEANS OF CONVERTING HUMAN-READABLE
DOCUMENTATION TO HIGH-DENSITY STORAGE ON PHOTO SENSITIVE MATERIALS, IS GIVEN,
WITH DETAILS OF ITS DIMENSIONS AND MANUFACTURERS. ATTRIBUTES OF THE OPTICAL
DATA DISC, INCLUDING DATA ENTRY, CODE FORMAT, REPLICATION AND PROJECTED COST
OF BLANK DISCS, ARE OUTLINED. A COMPARISON OF OPTICAL DATA DISCS AND
MICROFORMS IS MADE, WITH REFERENCE TO STORAGE CAPACITY, MATERIAL COST AND
RETRIEVAL TIME. THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF THE DISC IS ASSESSED.
NEWSPAPERS AND HOME VIDEO INFORMATION SYSTEMS' THE PRESENT, THE PROMISE AND
THE PERIL.
     
THE WAYS IN WHICH NEWSPAPERS AND ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY
COEXISTING AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY MAY AFFECT EACH OTHER IN THE FUTURE ARE
INVESTIGATED. AT PRESENT THERE EXISTS AN ATTITUDE WITHIN NEWSPAPERS THAT NEW
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER. CABLE TELETEXT,
VIEWDATA, AND VIDEODISCS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO NEWSPAPERS AND
INFORMATION STORAGE, AND TRANSMISSION. CONCERNING THE FUTURE, THE TYPE OF
INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE MORE SUITED TO ELECTRONIC THAN TRADITIONAL IS
CONSIDERED. LONG TERM EFFECTS ON NEWSPAPERS ARE DISCUSSED.
MICROFILM READERS. CATEGORY' HARDWARE STANDARD. SUBCATEGORY' COMPUTER OUTPUT
MICROFILM READERS.
     
THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STANDARD IS TO FACILITATE EFFECTIVE INFORMATION
INTERCHANGE WHEN THE INFORMATION IS RECORDED ON MICROFORMS GENERATED BY
COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE STANDARD DEFINES THE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE IMAGE QUALITY
FOR MICROFILM READING DEVICES FOR THE DISPLAY OF COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFORMS.
IT ALSO SETS REQUIREMENTS FOR HEAT AND NOISE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAFE
USE OF SUCH READING DEVICES.
NEWS ABOUT MICROFILM.
     
AFTER A DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERAL SITUATION IN THE FIELD OF MICROFILM AND ITS
APPLICATIONS IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE INTRODUCED IN 12 CHAPTERS' CAMERAS,
READERS FOR MICROFICHE AND ROLLFILM, READER-PRINTERS, ACCESSORIES, FILMS,
CHEMICALS, LABORATORY EQUIPMENT ETC.; A USEFUL REGISTER OF FIRMS IS ADDED.

THE PLACE OF SYSTEMATIC NOMENCLATURE IS APPRAISED BY RELATING ITS FUNCTIONS TO
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.
WILL LIBRARIANS BE NEEDED?.
     
STARTING FROM F.W. LANCASTER'S VISION OF A PAPERLESS SOCIETY THE AUTHOR
DISCUSSES SOME ASPECTS OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLISHING AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL, AS WELL AS THE ROLES OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS.
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
     
THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SCOTLAND WILL BE GREATLY ASSISTED BY
GOOD LEGISLATION TOGETHER WITH COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY
REVIEWED. OUTLINES THE LIMITATIONS OF THE LIBRARY COOPERATION COMMITTEE OF THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND AND RECOMMENDS THE SETTING UP OF AN ADVISORY
PANEL SIMILAR TO THE LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH
COULD PROVIDE ENCOURAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE TO AUTHORITIES IN FULFILLING THEIR
STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS. AN ADEQUATELY STAFFED SCOTTISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
WOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY BACKUP FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE FIELD AND WOULD BE
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE OPINION OF THE PROFESSION MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY TO THE
SCOTTISH OFFICE AND A SCOTTISH LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL. STRESSES THE
INITIATIVE, COMMITMENT AND ABILITY NEEDED IN LIBRARIANS AT THE POINT OF
SERVICE.
PEEBLES '81' PROCEEDINGS OF THE 67TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE SCOTTISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION 25-28 MAY 1981-THEME FOR THE TIMES' A CONSIDERATION OF SOME OF THE
MAJOR ISSUES CONFRONTING LIBRARIES IN THE 1980'S.
     
PROCEEDINGS OF THE 67TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE SCOTTISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
PEEBLES, 25-28 MAY 81, WHICH CONSIDERED MAJOR ISSUES CONFRONTING LIBRARIES IN
THE 1980S. FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL PAPERS 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'-.
LENIN'S PROGRAMME IN ACTION (ALL-UNION SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE).
     
PRESENTS SUMMARIES OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATION OF
LENIN'S IDEAS IN LIBRARY PRACTICE OF THE SOCIALIST SOCIETY ORGANISED TO
COMMEMORATE THE 110TH ANNIVERSARY OF LENIN'S BIRTH IN MAY 80. SOME
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE DEVOTED TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK SUCH AS
THE ROLE OF BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE PROMOTION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
LITERATURE, AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSING IN THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY.
OTHER PAPERS CONCENTRATED ON ACHIEVEMENTS IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK OF THE STATE
LIBRARIES OF INDIVIDUAL REPUBLICS, THEIR SERVICES TO ALL TYPES OF READERSHIP,
PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES, INTERLIBRARY LOANS, CENTRALISATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY
NETWORKS AND METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO LIBRARIES WITHIN THE NETWORK.
TURKISH LIBRARY DEVELOPMENTS.
     
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE CAME TO BE GRADUALLY APPRECIATED IN
TURKEY ONLY IN THE 1940S WHEN ADNAN OTUKEN RETURNED FROM LIBRARY SCIENCE
STUDIES IN GERMANY. DETERMINED TO MAKE LIBRARIANSHIP A RECOGNISED PROFESSION,
HE CAMPAIGNED FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY (ESTABLISHED IN 1946), TAUGHT LIBRARY
SCIENCE (BASIS OF DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT ANKARA UNIVERSITY), AND
HELPED FOUND THE TURKISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN 1949. PUBLIC AND CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES HAVE INCREASED IN NUMBERS IN THE LAST DECADE (244 TO 700 AND 174 TO
400). THEIR PROBLEMS INCLUDE LACK OF TRAINED STAFF AND THE 180,000 MANUSCRIPTS
AND RARE BOOKS IN THEIR CARE. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN UNEVEN
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE MOST NEGLECTED. TURDOK (NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE
FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1966. LIBRARY EDUCATION
PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN TANZANIA.
     
FOLLOWING INDEPENDENCE IN 1961 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FORMER BRITISH COLONY OF
TANZANIA HAS PLACED A HIGH PRIORITY ON THE PROVISION OF EDUCATION FOR ALL
LEVELS OF THE POPULATION. AS PART OF THIS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FUNDS HAVE
BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE NATIONAL BUDGET FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES.
IN 1963 THE GOVERNMENT FOUNDED THE TANGANYIKA LIBRARY SERVICES BOARD WHICH WAS
REPLACED IN 1975 BY THE TANZANIA LIBRARY SERVICES BOARD. THE BOARD'S FUNCTIONS
INCLUDE THE SUPERVISION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE TANZANIA NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF
THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND OF TRAINED LIBRARIANS THE BOARD
HAS BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES OF PROVIDING AT LEAST 1 PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN EACH REGION OF THE COUNTRY.
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANSHIP IN SWAZILAND.
     
DESCRIBES VARIOUS TYPES OF LIBRARIES IN SWAZILAND. HIGHLIGHTS BASIC PROBLEMS
IN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN THAT COUNTRY. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE
PRESENT SITUATION ARE OUTLINED ALONG WITH RECENT MOVES BY THE GOVERNMENT TO
IMPROVE THE STATE OF INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.
SHARING AT CHRISTCHURCH. LAA-NZLA CONFERENCE 1981.
     
REPORT ON THE 1ST JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA AND
THE NEW ZEALAND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, CHRISTCHURCH, JAN 81. TOPICS COVERED
INCLUDED EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, THE NEED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION,
INTERNATIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP, AND THE EFFECT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN
SOCIETY AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE SHARING OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION
SERVICES. PAPERS AND PANEL SESSIONS ARE SUMMARISED AND CRITICISM IS LEVELLED
AT THE CHAIRMANSHIP AND AT THE PRACTICE OF READING PAPERS RATHER THAN
DISCUSSING MAIN POINTS THEREIN.
LOTKA'S LAW AND LIBRARY LITERATURE.
     
THE APPLICABILITY OF LOTKA'S LAW TO LIBRARY SCIENCE LITERATURE WAS TESTED BY
COLLECTING AUTHORSHIP DATA FROM 2LIBRARY LITERATURE1 (1978 CUMULATED ANNUAL
VOLUME) AND BY CREDITING WORKS OF MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP TO ONLY THE FIRST-NAMED
AUTHOR. THE DATA WAS FOUND TO CONFORM TO AN INVERSE CUBE LAW MORE CLOSELY THAN
AN INVERSE SQUARE LAW (I.E. LOTKA'S LAW).

LIBRARY SCIENCE (AFTERWARDS ANNALS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AND DOCUMENTATION)
1DURING 1954-1975 (VOLS. 1-22) AS A BASE. OF THE TOTAL 1545 CITATIONS WHICH
APPEARED IN THE JOURNAL 217 RELATE TO INDIAN JOURNAL ARTICLES AND 350 RELATE
TO FOREIGN JOURNAL ARTICLES. OF THE INDIAN PERIODICALS 2ANNALS OF LIBRARY
SCIENCE (ANNALS OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AND DOCUMENTATION) 1WAS CITED MOST
ACCOUNTING FOR 48.4% OF THE INDIAN JOURNAL CITATIONS. OF THE FOREIGN
PERIODICALS, 2AMERICAN DOCUMENTATION 1WAS CITED MOST ACCOUNTING FOR 12% OF THE
TOTAL FOREIGN JOURNAL CITATIONS. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALS THAT 77% OF THE INDIAN
JOURNAL CITATIONS RELATE TO ONLY 5 JOURNALS, OUT OF 24 AND 68.3% OF THE
FOREIGN JOURNAL CITATION RELATE TO 16 JOURNALS OUT OF 85 JOURNALS CITED.

COMPLETE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF OVER 140 WORKS BY DR. HANSJORG SUBERKRUB, THE FORMER
LIBRARIAN OF BIELEFELD MUNICIPAL LIBRARY AND CHAIRMAN OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, ARRANGED CHRONOLOGICALLY AND COVERING MANY ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS.
LIBRARY RESEARCH.
     
THE LIBRARY RESEARCH PROGRAMME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE OF TAMPERE UNIVERSITY DATES FROM 1976. THE AREAS FOR RESEARCH ARE'
LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIETY; PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION AND
ITS USERS; STORAGE SYSTEMS; AND ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING. THESE TEND TO BE
LIBRARY ORIENTED RATHER THAN USER/COMMUNITY ORIENTED. FUTURE PROGRAMMES SHOULD
IDENTIFY PROBLEMS NOT OFFER SOLUTIONS. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MOST FRUITFUL TO
SEE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A PART OF SOCIOLOGY. THE NEW POST OF
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT.
P.N. BERKOV AND THE BEGINNINGS OF SOVIET RUSSIAN BOOK STUDIES (1923-1935).
     
OUTLINES THE CAREER OF PAVEL N. BERKOV, RUSSIAN TEACHER AND PUBLISHING
SCHOLAR; FOCUSSING ON HIS BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1923-1935.
DISCUSSES BERKOV'S MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS AS A BIBLIOGRAPHER, INCLUDING' HIS
ATTEMPT TO APPLY MARXIST-LENINIST METHODOLOGY TO BOOK STUDIES; AND HIS VIEWS
ON THE TECHNIQUES OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SEARCHING, OR HEURISTICS.
THANKS TO HANSJORG SUBERKRUB: THE RETIREMENT OF A GREAT LIBRARIAN.
     
AFTER THE WAR SUBERKRUB STUDIED AT KIEL UNIVERSITY AND HAMBURG LIBRARY SCHOOL.
HE WORKED IN KIEL LIBRARY FROM 1954-55 AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BECAME
MUNICIPAL LIBRARIAN OF BIELEFELD, WHERE HE REMAINED, MODERNISING AND EXPANDING
LIBRARY SERVICES UNTIL HIS RETIREMENT IN OCT 81. SUBERKRUB HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE
MEMBER OF MANY REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEES, ESPECIALLY AS
CHAIRMAN OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION FROM 1965 TO 1973. HE PLAYED AN
IMPORTANT PART IN THE CREATION OF BIBLIOTHEKSPLAN '73, A SCHEME FOR DEVELOPING
GERMAN LIBRARIES AT NATIONAL LEVELS. SINCE 1973 HE HAS BEEN OCCUPIED WITH
LIBRARIANSHIP IN NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA, ADVANCED TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS AND
AS CHAIRMAN OF THE STUDY GROUP ON LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. HE IS A PROLIFIC
AND IMPORTANT AUTHOR ON LIBRARIANSHIP.
THE NEED FOR LIBRARIES.
     
THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS AS WELL AS THE COMPUTERISATION OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY THE STAFF OF A SPECIAL
DEPARTMENT AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA. NOW, THE TIME
HAS COME TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES, SIMILAR
TO THE ONE IN PRAGUE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA. AMONG THE CENTRE'S 1ST AND FOREMOST
COMMITMENTS SHOULD BE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE CONTEMPORARY
WORLDWIDE TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND THEIR UP-TO-DATE
EQUIPMENT. THIS BROAD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE POOLED FOR THE NEW,
SPECIFIED LIBRARY BUILDINGS, AND ALSO FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION, EXTENSION AND
MODERNISATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES. SUCH ACTIVITIES SHOULD LEAD TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF ARCHIVES OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION AND INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ARCHITECTS, DESIGNERS, LIBRARIANS AND OTHERS. OTHER
LONG-TERM TARGETS INCLUDE THE DESIGN OF A NEW, PROGRESSIVE METHOD OF SERVICE
TO  READERS AND INFORMATION USERS AND TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF BOTH WORK AND
PRIVATE LIVES.
UNESCO AND PROBLEMS OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.
     
THE WORK OF UNESCO ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCUMENTATION, LIBRARY AND ARCHIVE
SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS ANALYSED. THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE OF
UNESCO-UNISIST II AND SOME ACTIVITIES CONCERNING THE FULFILMENT OF THE UNISIST
PROGRAMME ARE OUTLINED AND THE GENERAL INFORMATION PROGRAMME OF UNESCO IS
DISCUSSED.
BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND SCIENCE: THE IMAGE OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN IN
CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSION.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 10TH ADVANCED TRAINING SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS AT THE
HERZOG AUGUST LIBRARY IN WOLFENBUTTEL, FEB 81. FOR YEARS LIBRARIANS HAVE
ARGUED OVER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PURE LIBRARIANSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION IN
THEIR WORK, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN ALLOTTING TASKS TO THE
HIGHEST STAFF GRADES. LIBRARIANS FEEL THEMSELVES TO BE INADEQUATELY
REPRESENTED WHEN QUESTIONS ON UNIVERSITY STAFFING ARISE AND SHOULD STRIVE FOR
BETTER COORDINATION. ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PART OF THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AND CLOSE LINKS MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THIS DISCIPLINE AND
THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN. ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DUTIES FOR THE HIGHEST
STAFF GRADES, ESPECIALLY FOR HEADS OF SUBJECT DEPARTMENTS, MUST BE CLEARLY
DEFINED.
POLITICS, LIBRARIES AND UAP.
     
THE FIRST ISSUE OF 2SLJ' SOCIALIST LIBRARIANS JOURNAL1 CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A
NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON LIBRARIANSHIP FROM A SOCIALIST VIEWPOINT,
BUT FAILS TO EXPLAIN THE BASIC TENETS OF SOCIALIST LIBRARIANSHIP. REVIEWS SOME
OF THE RECENT LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC, AND SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES MUST,
THROUGH FREE ACCESS AND UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS), ALLOW
EVERY THINKING PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FORM HIS OR HER OWN OPINION OF THE WORLD
AND THE SOCIETY ROUND THEM. WHILST 2SLJ1 LACKS INGENUITY AND IS OFTEN
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, IT ALSO FAILS TO INDICATE THAT SOCIALISM MUST REQUIRE A
SOLID PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
DO LIBRARIANS FEAR PROFESSIONALISM?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED PROGRAMME AT
THE MICHIGAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, 11 OCT 80. ARGUES THAT IN THE USA LIBRARIANS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY HAVE
NO WAY OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY HAVE CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN OCCUPATIONAL GROUP
UNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEANS. BECAUSE OF LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS' EMPHASIS ON THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION ON
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROFESSIONAL BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONS
HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE LIBRARIAN HAS OCCUPATIONAL POWER WITHOUT
THE GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFESSIONAL POWER.
ON EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE.
     
IN THIS STUDY OF EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE, PERTINENT
EMPIRICAL LAWS AND HYPOTHESES, WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LITERATURE, WERE CATALOGUED, DESCRIBED, AND ANALYSED FOR THEIR
DEPENDENCIES AND RELATIONSHIPS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESEARCH WAS TO IDENTIFY
A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, DERIVED FROM EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS OF INFORMATION
PHENOMENA AND REPRESENTATIVE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A DISTINCT SCIENTIFIC
DISCIPLINE. THIS BODY OF KNOWLEDGE DEALS WITH CONCEPTS SUCH AS INFORMATION
VALUE, RELEVANCE, AGING OF INFORMATION, GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE, OBSOLESCENCE,
INFORMATION SCATTER, PRODUCTIVITY OF INFORMATION SOURCES AND INFORMATION FLOW.
THEORETICAL PROBLEMS OF INFORMATICS' CRITERIA OF THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION
SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES.
     
COLLECTION OF PAPERS DEVOTED ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE PROBLEM OF EVALUATING THE
QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
ON THE VALUE MEASUREMENT OF INFORMATION.
     
CONSIDERS A THEORETICAL MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF INFORMATION VALUE DETERMINATION
AND PROPOSES A CRITERION FOR PRACTICAL INFORMATION VALUE ESTIMATION. SHOWS
THAT SUCH AN APPROACH REPRESENTS A GENERALISATION OF THE STATISTICAL AMOUNT OF
INFORMATION.
QUANTITATIVE AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF THE CONCEPTION OF INFORMATION.
     
COMPARES THE MEANINGS OF THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION QUANTITY UNIT AND SHANNON'S
INFORMATION QUANTITY UNIT AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY CAN BE USED.
CONCLUDES THAT THE FORMER CAN BE A MEANS OF CALCULATING THE DEGREE OF
INFORMATION ADEQUACY AND DOES NOT EXHAUST ALL METHODS OF INFORMATION
MEASUREMENT. IF ONE PASSES FROM THE TASK OF INFORMATION TRANSFER TO THAT OF
INFORMATION STORAGE, THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION QUANTITY BECOMES THE CONCEPT
OF INFORMATION VOLUME.
AASL'S FIRST NATIONAL CONFERENCE.
     
THE FIRST NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIANS
TOOK PLACE FROM 25-28 SEPT 80 AT LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, TAKING AS ITS THEME
''80 AND BEYOND'. REPORTS ON THE ROUTINE MATTERS OF THE CONFERENCE, INCLUDING
REGISTRATION, TICKET SALES, AND RESPONSE TO PROGRAMMES, AND SUMMARISES FORUMS
WORKSHOPS AND SESSIONS.
DO STOP THIS DIVISION.
     
COMMENTS WITH REGRET ON THE FACT THAT DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES, WHICH FOR 73
YEARS HAD BEEN PART OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (DANMARKS
BIBLIOTEKSFORENING), FELT IT NECESSARY IN 1978 TO FORM THEIR OWN ASSOCIATION
(DANMARKS FORSKNINGSBIBLIOTEKSFORENINGS) AND THUS CAUSING A SPLIT IN THE
DANISH LIBRARY SYSTEM. DESPITE DF'S CHAIRMAN'S CONCILIATORY REMARKS AT DB'S 75
YEARS' JUBILEE IN 1980 THE NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, DF'S VICE CHAIRMAN, MADE SHARP
ATTACKS ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES, DB, THE MINISTER FOR CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND OTHER
POLITICIANS IN HIS REPORT TO DF'S ANNUAL MEETING 1981. HE ALSO ATTACKED THE
NEW LIBRARY BILL, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE EDUCATION AND THE
CULTURAL MINISTRIES. THE BILL PROPOSES 1 OVERALL ADMINISTRATION AND A
DIRECTORATE FOR EACH OF THE SECTORS, PUBLIC AND RESEARCH. ARGUES THAT DF
SHOULD SUPPORT THIS UNIFICATION OF THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. DB SHOULD TAKE THE
INITIATIVE BY ORGANISING A MEETING OF ALL PARTIES TO DISCUSS A LINK BETWEEN
THE 2 ORGAN ISATIONS.
CURRENT LIBRARY PROBLEMS IN FINLAND.
     
FINLAND HAS MORE THAN 10 LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS SUOMEN
KIRJASTOSEURA (THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION), ESTABLISHED IN 1910. IT IS
MAINLY CONCERNED WITH FURTHER EDUCATION, PUBLISHING, INFORMATION AND
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. SINCE 1978, THE STATE GRANT TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS
BEEN INCREASED TO 68%, MAKING FINNISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES THE LARGEST RECIPIENTS
OF STATE AID IN SCANDINAVIA. THE 1978 PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER LIBRARY SERVICES
FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD TO THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
NOR HAS ANY ACTION BEEN TAKEN ON THE FINANCE MINISTERIAL WORKING PARTY'S
REPORT OF 1979 ON STAFFING AND JOB DISTRIBUTION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. A 3 YEAR
COURSE FOR LIBRARY ASSISTANTS WAS BEGUN IN 1978. THE FINNISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION HAS POINTED OUT THAT DESPITE REASONABLE STATE GRANTS, CERTAIN
SECTORS, SUCH AS COUNTY AND MOBILE LIBRARIES, ARE INADEQUATELY FUNDED.
OUTLINES THE ASSOCIATION'S OBJECTIVES FOR THE 1980S.
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION CHANGES COURSE AGAIN.
     
CONSIDERS THE DESIRABILITY OF CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANS, AND
DESCRIBES THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH UK LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE PARTICIPATING IN
THIS PROCESS. DISCUSSES THE PROVISION FOR, AND POTENTIAL OF' SHORT COURSES;
PART-TIME 1ST DEGREE AND POST-GRADUATE COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP; TAUGHT MA
COURSES IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; AND RESEARCH DEGREES. ALSO
CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY OF LIBRARY SCHOOLS BECOMING INVOLVED, THROUGH BEC,
WITH SUB-PROFESSIONAL LEVEL COURSES. ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF 2 SURVEYS
DESIGNED TO JUDGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL CONTRIBUTION TO
STAFF DEVELOPMENT IN RECENT YEARS.
ZZZZ.
     
COMPARES THE EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS IN THE USA WITH THAT IN THE NORDIC
COUNTRIES.
THE CENTRE FOR THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND BIBLIOGRAPHERS.
     
PROVIDES A REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEADING RUSSIAN INSTITUTION IN THE
FIELD OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY EDUCATION, THE MOSKOVSKII GOSUDARSTVENNYI INSTITUT
KUL'TURY (MOSCOW STATE INSTITUTE OF CULTURE). THE INSTITUTE WAS ESTABLISHED IN
1930 AND OWES ITS FOUNDATION TO THE PERSONAL INITIATIVE OF N.K. KRUPSKAYA, WHO
LAID DOWN THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE INSTITUTE AS A HIGHER EDUCATION BODY
SPECIALISING IN THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND BIBLIOGRAPHERS, ESTABLISHED ITS
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES AND ADVISED ON ITS ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT. THE
STRUCTURE OF THE INSTITUTE AND THE COURSES PROVIDED HAVE CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES
DURING THE 50 YEARS OF THE INSTITUTE'S EXISTENCE. THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE
COVERED IN DETAIL. ALSO DESCRIBES THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION RESEARCH
PROGRAMME AND RESULTING PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES.
SPECIAL ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE DIRECTORY OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LIBRARY
SCHOOLS 1981).1
     
1TH EDITION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LIBRARY SCHOOLS' DIRECTORY OF
LIBRARY SCHOOLS, FACULTIES, AND ASSOCIATION MEMBERS AS A SEPARATE PUBLICATION.
INCLUDES 2 MAJOR SECTIONS' A LISTING BY SCHOOL OF ALL FACULTY MEMBERS AND
SUBJECTS AREAS; AND AN ALPHABETICAL LIST OF PERSONNEL WITH TITLE AND SCHOOL. A
NEW CLASSIFICATION SCHEME HAS BEEN USED IN THIS ISSUE TO INDICATE THE TEACHING
AREAS AND INTERESTS OF EACH FACULTY. 2 OTHER NEW FEATURES OF THIS EDITION ARE
THE NAMES OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIBRARY SCHOOL LIBRARY, AND A LIST OF
FACULTY MEMBERS QUALIFIED TO TEACH IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.
IN DEFENCE OF SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL TRAINING.
     
REPORTS ON THE MEETING OF THE 2 FACULTIES ON BIBLIOGRAPHY (GENERAL AND
SPECIAL) OF THE LENINGRADSKII GOSUDARSTVENNYI INSTITUT KUL'TURY (LENINGRAD
STATE INSTITUTE OF CULTURE) WHOSE LECTURERS MET TO DISCUSS THE ARTICLE IN
2SOVETSKAYA BIBLIOGRAFIYA1, 4 (1980) BY O.P. KORSHUNOV ON CURRENT NEEDS IN
BIBLIOGRAPHIC TRAINING. KORSHUNOV'S SUGGESTIONS FOR THE REORGANISATION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC COURSES ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A GREAT EFFECT ON THE IMPROVEMENT
OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC TRAINING IN THE USSR IN FUTURE. PAPERS PRESENTED BY THE
PARTICIPATING LECTURERS DISCUSSED THE EFFECT OF THE REORGANISATION ON THEIR
COURSES IN SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. A CONCLUSION WAS REACHED THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC
TRAINING WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PLANNED CHANGES AND GREATER COORDINATION OF
GENERAL AND SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY COURSES WILL HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE
EDUCATION OF FUTURE BIBLIOGRAPHERS.
TEACHING BIBLIOMETRICS.
     
CLAIMS THAT BIBLIOMETRICS, AS A SPECIFIC SUBJECT TOPIC, IS BEING NEGLECTED BY
LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND IS TREATED IN A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY MANNER BY RESEARCH
METHODS TEXTBOOKS AND THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE. ARGUES THAT BIBLIOMETRICS
SHOULD BE MOVED INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL CURRICULA.
DOCUMENTATION AS A PART OF THE SYLLABUS AT DUTCH LIBRARY SCHOOLS.
     
THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION' WAS 1ST USED BY PAUL OTLET OF THE INSTITUT
INTERNATIONAL DE BIBLIOGRAPHIE IN 1905. OTLET REGARDED 'BIBLIOGRAPHY' AS TOO
RESTRICTED A TERM TO COVER HIS ACTIVITIES. WITH THE INCREASING USE OF
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES IN THE 1960S USE OF THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION'
HAS BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY APPLIED TO CERTAIN TASKS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES.
IT IS THEREFORE UNREALISTIC TO CONSIDER LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION AS
SEPARATE DISCIPLINES. AT THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN
AMSTERDAM, DOCUMENTATION IS TAUGHT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COURSE FOR
ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS. THE SUBJECT OCCUPIES 20% OF THE SYLLABUS AND INCLUDES
SUBJECT INDEXING, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND ABSTRACTING TECHNIQUES.
COURSES FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP OFFERED IN A.L.A. ACCREDITED PROGRAMS AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EDUCATION OF SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIANS.
     
A SURVEY WAS MADE OF THE 68 LIBRARY SCHOOLS WITH A.L.A. ACCREDITATION TO
ASCERTAIN THE EXTENT AND TYPES OF THEIR COURSES IN SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP, IN
SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF LITERATURE. FROM
THE SURVEY RESULTS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH
THESE COURSES WOULD SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY
LIBRARIES. THE ROLE OF FIELD WORK WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED. STATISTICS ARE
PRESENTED ON THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF COURSES OFFERED AND THE TYPE OF FIELD
WORK AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS CONCERNED WITH SCI-TECH LIBRARIANSHIP.
THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN
ONTARIO.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND WORK OF THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO. DISCUSSES THE SCHOOL'S APPROACH
AND EDUCATIONAL GOALS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE FACILITIES, RESOURCES AND PROGRAMMES
WHICH ARE OFFERED FOR THOSE PROFESSIONALLY INTERESTED IN CONSERVATION AND
PRESERVATION THEORY AND PRACTICE.
TRAINING OF INFORMATION SPECIALISTS' PAPERS PRESENTED AT A SYMPOSIUM HELD AT
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA ON 6-7.
     
IN THE LAST DECADE A NEW INDUSTRY HAS EMERGED FROM THE CONJUNCTION OF DATA
BASES, COMPUTERS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE
GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY IS REVIEWED SHOWING HOW THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF
COMPUTERS FOR PRODUCTION PURPOSES PRODUCED NEW FORMS OF INFORMATION WHICH
ALLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERISED RETRIEVAL. THE VARIOUS TRENDS IN THE
DATA BASE FIELD ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE RESULTS OF AN ECONOMIC MODELLING STUDY
ARE USED TO PROJECT FUTURE COST LEVELS FOR SEARCHING DATA BASES ON-LINE. THIS
GENERATES THE NEED FOR INCREASED TRAINING WITH DATA BASES IF INDUSTRY IS TO
GET MAXIMUM RETURN FROM THEIR USE.
A LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSE TO TEACH GRADUATE LEVEL STUDENTS TWO COMMERCIAL
INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS.
     
PROFICIENCY IN SEARCHING 2 COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS (DIALOG AND ORBIT) IS THE
OBJECTIVE OF THE 15 WEEK COURSE TAUGHT TO GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL OF
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (SLIS) AT PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY. SOFTWARE WAS
DEVELOPED TO REPLICATE THE LANGUAGE, FORMATS AND SEARCH CAPABILITIES OF
DIALOG, ORBIT AND BRS. 60 STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT EACH TERM; THE COURSE IS OFFERED
3 TIMES ANNUALLY. THE STUDENTS ATTEND A LECTURE AND A 2 HOUR SUPERVISED
LABORATORY SESSION EACH WEEK. THE LECTURES ARE STRUCTURED TO GIVE THE STUDENTS
AN OVERVIEW OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION PROFESSION.
THE LABORATORY SESSIONS ARE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE
EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON LEARNING THE SYSTEMS BY BEING ON-LINE. EACH STUDENT HAS
THE USE OF A TERMINAL DURING THE LABORATORY SESSION; AND CONSEQUENTLY IS
ON-LINE A MINIMUM OF 30 HOURS PER TERM.
TRAINING NON-PROFESSIONAL STAFF' A QUESTIONNAIRE APPROACH.
     
DESCRIBES A QUESTIONNAIRE TECHNIQUE RECENTLY USED BY GLASGOW UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY AS PART OF A SEMINAR IN READER SERVICES TRAINING FOR NON-PROFESSIONAL
STAFF. THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE DISCUSSIONS PROMPTED BY IT ALLOWED A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GUIDANCE ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF READER SERVICES TO BE
CONVEYED IN A SHORT TIME, AND IN A MANNER WHICH THE TRAINEES SEEMED TO FIND
STIMULATING. BRIEFLY ANALYSES THE QUESTIONS INVOLVED AND THEIR POSSIBLE AND
ACCEPTABLE ANSWERS, AND INDICATES HOW THIS TECHNIQUE COULD BE ADAPTED TO SUIT
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFF TRAINING.
IMPROVING LIBRARY EDUCATION FOR SELECTED MINORITIES.
     
INTENDED TO IDENTIFY EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN
PREPARING SPANISH SURNAMED AND AMERICAN INDIAN STUDENTS FOR LIBRARY CAREERS
AND TO DESCRIBE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES FOR
THESE MINORITIES, THIS STUDY EXAMINED 8 SUCH PROGRAMMES THROUGH THEIR FINAL
REPORTS, INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPATING FACULTY AND STUDENTS, AND DOCUMENTS
ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT AND ACADEMIC AFFAIRS. THE SET OF 18
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ORGANISED UNDER 5 TOPICS' STUDENT RECRUITMENT, STUDENT
SELECTION, CURRICULUM DESIGN, SUPPORT SERVICES, AND PLACEMENT/FOLLOW-UP
ACTIVITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

GERMANY.
     
DISCUSSES NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS CONCERNED WITH
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY AND LISTS LIBRARIES AND
GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH CONTAIN SYSTEMATICALLY BUILT-UP AND DEVELOPED
COLLECTIONS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LITERATURE. MENTIONS IN PARTICULAR THE
WORK OF THE ARBEITSGEMEINSCHAFT DER SPECIALBIBLIOTHEKEN (SPECIAL LIBRARIES
WORKING GROUP) AND THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH
ASSOCIATION).
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL LIBRARIES-THE UNITED KINGDOM INFRASTRUCTURE.
     
BRIEFLY REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL LIBRARIES AND THE
INTEREST OF VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL BODIES IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THE WORK OF THE
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, ASLIB AND THE INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IN THE
FIELD OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES IS DISCUSSED. ALSO MENTIONS
GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT AND THE WORK OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN CAB, IFIS AND IAALD.
     
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMONWEALTH AGRICULTURAL BUREAUX
(CAB) AND THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD INFORMATION SERVICE (IFIS), AS WELL AS OF THE
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS
(IAALD) ARE SUMMARISED. AS REGARDS THE CAB, THE GROWTH IN OUTPUT OF
INFORMATION PRODUCTS, FROM 15 MAIN ABSTRACT JOURNALS IN 1939 TO 27 MAIN
ABSTRACT JOURNALS PLUS 16 SPECIALIST ABSTRACT JOURNALS IN 1981 IS REPORTED.
REGARDING IFIS, THE COMPLETE DATA BASE OF 2FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
ABSTRACTS 1IS AVAILABLE IN MACHINE-READABLE FORM SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE
SERVICE IN 1969, A UNIQUE FEATURE SHARED ONLY BY ONE OTHER INTERNATIONAL DATA
BASE. DESCRIBES A NEW SCHEME FOR MAKING THE FSTA DATA BASE AVAILABLE, FREE OF
CHARGE, TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
FIFTY YEARS OF SERVICING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND
PRACTICAL FARMING.
     
THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY (CSAL), THE MAIN AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARY OF THE USSR, CELEBRATED ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY ON 23 JULY 1980. THE
LIBRARY IS THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY IN THE WORLD AND ACTS AS THE STATE
ALL-UNION DEPOSITORY OF NATIONAL AND FOREIGN LITERATURE, THE CENTRE OF
AGRICULTURAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE SCIENTIFIC AND SYSTEMATIC CENTRE FOR ALL
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES OF THE USSR.
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES OF NEPAL.
     
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IN NEPAL IS UNDER PRESSURE TO HELP INCREASE FOOD
PRODUCTION. LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT THIS RESEARCH ARE FOUND AT KHUMALTAR,
KIRTIPUR, KATMANDU AND TERAL. DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE LIBRARIES ARE GIVEN.
EFFECTIVE USE OF AVAILABLE LIBRARY RESOURCES IS LIMITED BY THE LACK OF
ORGANISATION OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AND BY THE ABSENCE OF INTERLIBRARY
CO-OPERATION. TRAINED LIBRARY PERSONNEL ARE NEEDED TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION
AND PLANS ARE BEING MADE TO OBTAIN THEM.
USE OF THE DANISH VETERINARY AND AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY BY DIRECT LIBRARY USERS
AND USERS OF AN ONLINE DOCUMENTATION SERVICE.
     
AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN THE ACQUISITION BUDGET THE DANISH VETERINARY AND
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY CARRIED OUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT USE OF THE
LIBRARY. THIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE WHICH PARTS OF THE COLLECTION COULD BE CUT
DOWN WITHOUT CAUSING TOO MUCH INCONVENIENCE TO THE SUERS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT
APPPROXIMATELY 85% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS WERE COVERED BY APPROXIMATELY 7%
OF THE CURRENT SERIALS. APPROXIMATELY 30% OF REQUESTS WERE FOR BOOKS. IT WAS
CONCLUDED THAT AN EFFICIENT BACK-UP SERVICE FOR AN ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION
SERVICE COULD BE PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARY COLLECTION, THE DANISH INTERLENDING
LIBRARY STRUCTURE AND SCANDINAVIAN CO-OPERATION AGREEMENTS. THIS BACK-UP
SERVICE IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE IN EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS. IT WAS DECIDED THAT
A JOINT SCANDINAVIAN UNION CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN SERIALS BASED ON THE ISDS FILE
WILL BE A VALUABLE TOOL IN THE SCAN DINAVIAN INTERLENDING SYSTEMS.
LIBRARY DESCRIPTION' WHERE MUSES ARE PRESERVED-THE DUTCH LITERARY MUSEUM AND
ARCHIVES CENTRE.
     
THE NEDERLANDS LETTERKUNDIG MUSEUM EN DOCUMENTATIECENTRUM WAS FOUNDED IN THE
HAGUE IN 1953. THE MUSEUM WAS GREATLY EXPANDED IN 1954 BY A FORMER CITY
ARCHIVIST OF THE HAGUE, DR. W. MOLL, WHO DEPOSITED ON PERMANENT LOAN HIS
PRIVATE COLLECTION OF 360 BOXES OF MATERIAL RELATING TO ABOUT 1,500 DUTCH
AUTHORS. THE COLLECTION NOW CONTAINS MANUSCRIPTS, CORRECTED PROOFS,
PUBLISHERS' CONTRACTS, BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS, PORTRAITS AND GRAMOPHONE AND
TAPE-RECORDINGS RELATING TO DUTCH AUTHORS OF THE POST-1750 PERIOD. THE MUSEUM
IS FINANCED PARTLY BY THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND PARTLY BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND
HAS AN ANNUAL PURCHASE GRANT OF APPROXIMATELY *64,000. IN 1982 THE MUSEUM WILL
BE REHOUSED IN THE NEW ROYAL LIBRARY BUILDINGS AT PRESENT NEARING COMPLETION
IN THE HAGUE.
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARMY LIBRARY.
     
THE REPORTS DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE ARMY LIBRARY, PENTAGON. THEY CONSTITUTE A SUBSET OF THE GENERAL REPORTS
DEVELOPED FOR THE CIRCULATION MODULE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,
LISTER HILL NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATION'S INTEGRATED LIBRARY
SYSTEM.
AN ACTIVE FACTOR IN THE PROGRESS/DEVELOPMENT OF THE BULGARIAN NATION.
     
WHEN INTERVIEWED ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS, PRIORITIES AND PROBLEMS OF THE CYRIL AND
METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA, ITS DIRECTOR EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF
INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH BOOKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY, FOR THE COUNTRY'S PROGRESS. ALTHOUGH THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A
SMALL COUNTRY LIKE BULGARIA ARE ALMOST THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE LARGE COUNTRY,
THE FORMER MUST BE MUCH MORE SELECTIVE AND CAREFULLY BUDGETED BECAUSE OF ITS
LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL, AND PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN
CURRENCIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S BOOK COLLECTION IS IN FACT, OPEN TO THE
WHOLE COUNTRY BY MEANS OF INTERLENDING. IT HAS THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR
PUBLISHING THE BULGARIAN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, COMPUTERISATION OF WHICH HAS
GRADUALLY BEEN INTRODUCED. EXTENSION OF THE PRESENT BUILDING, CONSTRUCTION OF
A DEPOSITORY LIBRARY TOGETHER WITH OVERALL NEW INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW THE
LIBRARY TO MEET THE INCR EASING DEMANDS ON ITS SERVICES AND HELP TO MAINTAIN
STANDARDS.
HISTORY OF THE KFAR GIL'ADI LIBRARY-A CASE STUDY OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES (IN
HEBREW).
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF KFAR GIL'ADI'S LIBRARY, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
DEVELOPMENT WAS SIMILAR IN OTHER VETERAN KIBBUTZIM. IT IS BASED MOSTLY ON ORAL
AND WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION-A LENGTHY INTERVIEW WITH HAIM YISRAELI, FOUNDER OF
THE LIBRARY, MINUTES OF KIBBUTZ GENERAL MEETINGS AND WRITTEN REPORTS BY
LIBRARIANS. WHEN YISRAELI ARRIVED IN KFAR GIL'ADI IN 1934 HE FOUND ABOUT 250
BOOKS. TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE HE VOLUNTARILY ORGANISED THE COLLECTION AND
ENHANCED IT SO THAT IN 1938 IT CONTAINED 10,000 VOLUMES AND BECAME AN
IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ MEMBERS. TODAY THE
LIBRARY IS NO LONGER A CULTURAL CENTRE AND THE COLLECTION DOES NOT MEET THE
NEEDS OF THE MEMBERS. DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH THE LIBRARY COULD ONCE MORE
BECOME AN IMPORTANT CENTRE FOR THE COMMUNITY.
RESEARCH; AND STANDARDS FOR LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
LITERATURE REVIEW OF MATERIALS RELATED TO US LIBRARY STANDARDS, ARRANGED IN 6
SECTIONS' LIBRARY STANDARDS AS MEASURABLE LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE; WHAT
STANDARDS ARE MEANT TO ACCOMPLISH; CHANGES IN DIRECTION; IMPACT ON IMPROVEMENT
OF SERVICES; REQUIREMENTS FOR MEANINGFUL STANDARDS; AND CAN STANDARDS BE BASED
ON SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY? THE MAIN EMPHASIS IS ON STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY
SERVICE.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AUTHORITIES CONFERENCE 1980.
     
THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE PRESENTED AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITIES
CONFERENCE, SOUTHPORT, 6-9 OCT 80: 'THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NATIONAL NETWORK', BY ROYSTON BROWN; 'THE CONSEQUENCES FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES
OF RECENT LEGISLATION', BY N.P. HEPWORTH; 'THE POLITICAL VIEW', BY D.E. DELL;
'TAKEN FOR GRANTED', BY ALEX HOWSON; 'DIRECTORATES-RIGHT OR WRONG?', BY ALAN
LONGWORTH; 'LIBRARY USER CONSULTATIONS', BY W.J. MURISON; 'THE FUTURE
CHALLENGE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES', BY ROY SMITH.
PUBLIC LIBRARY STATISTICS. 1981-82 ESTIMATES.
     
INCLUDES FIGURES FOR 47 COUNTRIES, 32 LONDON BOROUGHS, THE CITY OF LONDON, 36
METROPOLITAN DISTRICTS AND 4 WELSH DISTRICTS.
WHAT'S TO BE DONE? MEASURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
AND LITERATURE PROVISION.
     
THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S TASKS AND DUTIES IN WEST GERMANY
MUST BE CHANGED; OUTDATED STANDARDS ARE A HINDRANCE. THE CONCEPT SHOULD DEMAND
A FUNDAMENTAL UNITY OF PURPOSE AGREED BETWEEN LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND
ADMINISTRATION AND PROVIDE TASKS FOR THE LIBRARY WITHOUT PEDANTIC EMPHASIS ON
THEORETICAL NICETIES. THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING CAN ASSIST IN
EXPLAINING THE PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP TO THE ADMINISTRATION.
LIBRARIES MUST EXPRESS THE NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM THROUGH THEIR STAFF
ASSOCIATIONS. CURRENT PLANS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE REASSESSED.
FEDERAL MINISTRIES AND ADVISORY CENTRES SHOULD BE MORE CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH
LIBRARIES AND MORE USE SHOULD BE MADE OF MASS MEDIA PUBLICITY. SURVEYS SHOULD
BE CARRIED OUT ON LIBRARY USE AND LARGE LIBRARIES SHOULD ASSIST IN THE
FINANCING OF LIBRARY RESEARCH.
STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN 1980.
     
THE NUMBER OF BORROWERS IN FINNISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES WENT DOWN BY 1% FROM THE
PREVIOUS YEAR, BUT THE NUMBER OF BOOKS LOANED WENT UP BY 2%. AV LOANS WENT UP
BY 16%. THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE PER INHABITANT WAS 73 FINNISH MARKS. THERE WERE
1,343 FULL TIME PROFESSIONALS, AN INCREASE OF 8.8% FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR, AND
950 PART-TIME PROFESSIONALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN
FINLAND WAS 4,748,688, THE NUMBER OF MAIN LIBRARIES 448, BRANCH LIBRARIES 937
(A DECREASE OF 3% FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR), AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BOOKS WAS
21.9 MILLION, 5 BOOKS PER INHABITANT.
GOODBYE AND THANKS FOR THE FIGHT.
     
INTERVIEW WITH A NORWEGIAN CHIEF LIBRARIAN WHO HAS RECENTLY MOVED TO CULTURAL
ADMINISTRATION, HAVING HELD JOINT POSTS SINCE 1967. DISCUSSES THE CHIEF
LIBRARIAN/CULTURAL SECRETARY RELATIONSHIP WITHIN MUNICIPAL AND COUNTRY
ADMINISTRATION; THE ROLE OF THE STATE, THE MINISTRY OF CHURCH AND EDUCATION
AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 70S, A DIFFICULT
TIME FOR NORWEGIAN LIBRARIANSHIP; THE MAIN PROBLEMS FACING NORWEGIAN LIBRARIES
IN THE 80S; HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY
EMPLOYEES; HIS GREATEST SATISFACTIONS (SALARY IMPROVEMENTS, LIBRARIANS'
RECOGNITION AS A PROFESSION, AND THE FORWARD PROGRESS OF THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY
SERVICE) AND HIS GREATEST IRRITATION (THAT LIBRARIANS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY
POLITICALLY INVOLVED).
HERE THE LIBRARIAN DONATES HER SALARY TO THE LIBRARY.
     
A TALK GIVEN TO THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING ON THE THEME' PART-TIME
LIBRARIES TODAY AND TOMORROW. WITH A DEFINITION OF PART-TIME LIBRARIES AS
THOSE OPEN ONLY A FEW HOURS A WEEK, ICELAND HAS ONLY 15 FULL-TIME LIBRARIES
OUT OF 250; 25 OF 40 CENTRAL LIBRARIES ARE PART-TIME. WITH 60% OF THE
POPULATION LIVING IN THE REYKJAVIK REGION AND THE REST SCATTERED IN SMALL
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE A LIBRARY SERVICE
WHICH FULFILS IFLA NORMS. THE LIBRARY ACT OF 1976 MADE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LIBRARIES. MANY, THEREFORE, COMBINED SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AS EDUCATION RECEIVES STATE SUPPORT. MOST LIBRARIES CHARGE
FEES FOR BORROWING AND MOST LIBRARIANS ARE UNQUALIFIED. THE SOLUTION LIES IN
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CENTRAL LIBRARIES TO 8; THESE SHOULD BE RUN BY THE
STATE AND HAVE MOBILE LIBRARIES. LOCAL LIBRARIES SHOULD ALSO BE FEWER.
TRAINING FOR PART-TIME LIBRARIANS WITH PROPER SALARY CONDI TIONS SHOULD BE
INITIATED.
A DELPHI STUDY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY GOALS, INNOVATIONS, AND PERFORMANCE
MEASUREMENTS.
     
UTILISING THE DELPHI TECHNIQUE, THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED AND RANKED PUBLIC
LIBRARY GOALS AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS, AS WELL AS VIABLE LIBRARY
INNOVATIONS LIKELY BY THE YEAR 2000. THE INDEPENDENTLY ELICITED STATEMENTS
FROM 2 SETS OF EXPERTS, PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS OF
ALA-ACCREDITED GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES WERE ANALYSED SEPARATELY AND
THEN COMPARED FOR SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES.
RURAL LIBRARY SERVICES' THE WELSH SCENE.
     
LOOKS AT THE EFFECTS OF LEGISLATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL LIBRARY
SERVICES IN WALES AND THE PROBLEMS OF MAINTAINING THESE SERVICES FOR A
BILINGUAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS VERY SCATTERED. THE COST OF RUNNING SUCH SERVICES
IS HIGH WHEREAS INCOME IS LOW BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INDUSTRY AND THUS LOW
RATEABLE VALUES. DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE WELSH BOOK COUNCIL, THE DEVELOPMENT
BOARD FOR RURAL WALES AND THE WELSH NATIONAL CENTRE FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE.
THE MANPOWER SERVICES COMMISSION'S SCHEMES HAVE GIVEN WELSH RURAL LIBRARIES AN
OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER TO LAUNCH A HOST OF INTERESTING AND
WORTHWHILE SCHEMES.
LIBRARY SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS OF THE VRACA REGION.
     
FOLLOWING LENIN'S EXHORTATION THAT EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD HAVE A LIBRARY WITHIN
1.5-2 KM FROM HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE, LIBRARY SERVICES IN 3 RURAL DISTRICTS IN
THE MOUNTAINOUS PART OF THE VRACA REGION ARE REVIEWED. THERE ARE ABOUT 36
LOCALITIES AND VILLAGES THERE, BUT ONLY 3 OF THEM HAVE MORE THAN 2,500
INHABITANTS. IN SPITE OF GOOD PUBLIC TRANSPORT, PROVISION MUST BE MADE FOR
PEOPLE WORKING IN REMOTE MINES AND ON SHEEP FARMS. BOOK COLLECTIONS IN LOCAL
PUBLIC LIBRARIES RANGE FROM 3,000-6,000 VOLUMES. AT PRESENT ANNUAL
ACQUISITIONS ARE ON AVERAGE 4.5 VOLUMES PER CAPITA, AGAINST ONLY 0.49 VOLUME
IN 1954. THE TARGET IS 6.5 VOLUMES PER CAPITA. AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS DISCUSSED
ARE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARY IN VRACA, CENTRALISATION OF
ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING, DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE LITERATURE AND THE MOST
EFFICIENT USE OF FINANCIAL ALLOWANCES.
THE CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARY IN QUEBEC' A MODEL REGIONAL STRUCTURE.
     
DRAWS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF QUEBEC CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARY OVER 10 YEARS TO
DEMONSTRATE THE SUCCESS IN THIS FIELD OF THE STATE REGIONALISATION PROGRAMME.
SHOWS HOW THE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS TO PROMOTE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND REGIONAL
COOPERATION; ENCOURAGES POPULAR EDUCATION AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES; AND UTILISES
THE REGIONAL CULTURAL HERITAGE. IN CONCLUSION, URGES THIS PROOF OF SUCCESS AS
JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUED STATE SUPPORT.
ONE WORD MORE ABOUT COSINESS..
     
DESCRIBES GENTOFTE MAIN PUBLIC LIBRARY AND INTERVIEWS LIBRARIANS, USERS AND
THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. THE 1ST IMPRESSION OF COSINESS IS DISPELLED
ON CLOSER EXAMINATION, WHICH REVEALS GROSS OVERCROWDING IN STAFF WORKING
AREAS. THE PRESENT BUILDING WAS ERECTED IN 1928 AND ADDITIONS WERE SOON
NECESSARY. THE CHILDREN'S SECTION, THE CATALOGUE DEPARTMENT AND THE STACKS ARE
PLACED ELSEWHERE WITH ENSUING TRANSPORT PROBLEMS. SEVERAL PLANS FOR A NEW
LIBRARY HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY GOVERNMENT CUTS, DESPITE LOCAL POLITICAL
GOODWILL. HOWEVER, GENTOFTE LIBRARY SERVICE AS A WHOLE IS WELL PROVIDED, WITH
5 BRANCH LIBRARIES, ART LIBRARY, SPOKEN NEWSPAPER, DOMICILIARY LENDING
SERVICE, HOSPITAL SERVICE, CENTRAL GUEST WORKERS' COLLECTION, AND ARRANGEMENTS
FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. THE CUTS HAVE COME AT A TIME OF INCREASING LOANS, BUT
STILL LEAVE THE LIBRARY ABOVE AVERAGE IN MATERIALS AND STAFF. DESCRIBES THE 2
YEAR EXPERIMENT WHICH BEGAN AT GENTOFTE ON 1 MAR 81 WITH ON-LINE SE ARCHING
USING THE DIALOG AND EURONET DATA BASES. THE LIBRARY RECEIVES ABOUT 2,000
SUBJECT ENQUIRIES FROM OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE COUNTY; ONLY THOSE WHICH ARE
DEEMED AT A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVEL (15%) ARE DEALT WITH BY THE COMPUTER.
I AM SO ENVIOUS.
     
GIVES A PORTRAIT OF SILKEBORG PUBLIC LIBRARY, DENMARK AND COMPARES IT TO THE
LIBRARY OF THE AUTHOR'S CHILDHOOD. INTERVIEWS JUDITTHE BOOCK, THE CHAIRMAN OF
THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE, WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED A CIVIC CENTRE, BUT HAD TO BE
CONTENT WITH A 1,260 SQ.M. EXTENSION IN 1978 AND ACQUISITION OF OTHER
BUILDINGS TO HOUSE THE LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTION AND CHILDREN'S ACTIVITIES, NOW
IN THE MAIN LIBRARY. WOULD LIKE MORE BRANCH LIBRARIES IN THE SUBURBS, BUT
REGARDS MOBILE LIBRARIES AS ADEQUATE FOR THE AUTHORITY'S THINLY POPULATED
PERIPHERY. WELCOMES THE USE OF THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY AS A CHILD MINDING
SERVICE AND LEISURE CENTRE AND APPROVES OF NON-BOOK MATERIAL SUCH AS MUSIC AND
POSTERS. INTERVIEWS THE DRIVER AND MOBILE LIBRARIAN. CHILDREN CONSTITUTE 75%
OF MOBILE LIBRARY USERS, WITH OLD PEOPLE NEXT IN IMPORTANCE. A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP TO THE READERS HAS DEVELOPED AND READERS ARE WELL SATISFIED WITH
THE SELECTION OF BOOKS. INTERVIEWS THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN, POVL SKOV, WHO HOPES
TO OPE N 4 NEW BRANCHES DURING THE 80S. THE CUTS HAVE HITHERTO AFFECTED
PURCHASE OF NEW BOOKS AND STAFFING, BUT SERVICES LIKE RESERVATIONS CAN NO
LONGER BE EXEMPTED. ACCEPTS THAT THE LIBRARY MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME
ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS AS OTHER LOCAL SERVICES.
THE LOSS FOR BUSINESS IS THE LIBRARY'S GAIN.
     
A PORTRAIT OF VISSENBJERG LIBRARY SERVICE, FUNEN, DENMARK WHICH HAS RECENTLY
ATTAINED FULL-TIME STATUS. THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE SAVINGS INCURRED
WHEN THE LIBRARY, FORMERLY HOUSED IN A SCHOOL, BOUGHT SPACE IN A SHOPPING
CENTRE WHERE MANY SHOPS HAD HAD TO CLOSE. COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING METHODS WERE
USED TO ATTRACT READERS. THE LIBRARY IS NOW OPEN 20 HOURS A WEEK AND STAFF HAS
EXPANDED. THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN HELPED BY THE 2.4 MILLION KR. GRANT FROM
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE, WHICH ALSO PARTLY COVERS RUNNING COSTS DURING THE
1ST 3 YEARS. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LIBRARIAN, OLE HANSEN, THE PROBLEMS OF A
RAPIDLY GROWING READERSHIP WERE DISCUSSED. HE IS HOPEFUL THAT ACQUISITIONS
WILL KEEP PACE WITH LOANS. SEES THE LIBRARY AS A PLACE WHERE DEMOCRACY IS
NURTURED AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN MEET AND FEEL AT HOME. INTERVIEWS LOCAL
POLITICIANS, WHO ARE SATISFIED WITH THE LIBRARY'S LOCATION AND HOPE TO BE ABLE
TO PRESERVE THE 4 PART-TIME BRANCHES. INTER VIEWS 2 OF THE PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS, WHO ARE RELIEVED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS OF ACCOUNTING AND
BOOK SELECTION HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEM TO THE MAIN LIBRARY, BUT WOULD LIKE
TO IMPROVE SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY.
IT WAS IN THE VERY LAST MOMENT.
     
DESCRIBES ROSKILDE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHOSE 20 MILLION KR. EXPANSION COMPLETED
IN 1980 WAS APPROVED BEFORE THE CUTS WOULD HAVE MADE SUCH DEVELOPMENT
IMPOSSIBLE. INTERVIEWS MEMBERS OF THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE. SAVINGS HAVE HAD TO
BE MADE IN THE BUDGETS FOR MATERIALS AND STAFF, AND NO NEW ACTIVITIES, APART
FROM A SPOKEN NEWSPAPER, ARE PLANNED. IN AN INTERVIEW, THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN
REGRETS THE CUTS IN MATERIALS AMOUNTING TO 12% AND BLAMES THE FAILURE OF ADULT
LOANS TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY AFTER THE EXPANSION ON THE LACK OF POPULAR
TITLES. THE VERY LARGE OPEN PLAN ADULT LIBRARY MEANS LONG DISTANCES FOR
LIBRARIANS AND SOME CONFUSION AMONG READERS. THE LACK OF A CONCERT HALL AND
MEETING ROOMS IS FELT. TO MEET THIS NEED, HIRE OF A HALL IN HOTEL PRINDSEN IS
PLANNED. INCLUDES AN ARCHITECTURAL EVALUATION OF THE BUILDING AND ITS
LOCATION. DISCUSSES THE AUTHORITY'S POLICY TOWARDS CLUBS AND CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS. DESCRIBES THE REFERENCE SECTION, WHERE AN INCREASE IN DEMAND
HAS LED TO PROBLEMS OF LACK OF STAFF. INCLUDES STATISTICS.

FIRST CONCEPTIONS OF THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING AT FREIBERG MINING COLLEGE.
     
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING AT FREIBERG MINING COLLEGE WAS
INCLUDED IN THE 1976-80 5 YEAR PLAN. THE FOUNDATION STONE WAS LAID ON 3 NOV 77
BY ALFRED NEUMANN, A MEMBER OF THE POLITBURO. HE ALSO OPENED THE LIBRARY ON 24
JUNE 80 NAMING IT GEORGIUS AGRICOLA LIBRARY. FREIBERG IS A MINING TOWN AND THE
LIBRARY IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THE FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF
MINING IN EAST GERMANY. THE TOTAL STOCK OF THE LIBRARY AMOUNTS TO 500,000
VOLUMES. OVER 6,000 REGISTERED USERS CAN BE SUPPLIED WITH LITERATURE, WITH 260
READING PLACES, A MULTI-PURPOSE EXHIBITION ROOM, MODERN DUPLICATORS, STOCK
CATALOGUES AND INFORMATION SERVICES AT THEIR DISPOSAL.
OBSERVATIONS ON READER BEHAVIOUR IN A COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY.
     
THE 10 COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES IN NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA HAVE A TOTAL
STOCK OF 850,000 ITEMS FOR OVER 50,000 STUDENTS AND 2,000 TEACHERS; IN 1980-81
THEIR LIBRARY BUDGETS AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN 3 MILLION DM. LOANS HAVE RISEN
STEADILY SINCE 1974 OWING TO LARGER BOOK STOCKS, LONGER OPENING HOURS, MORE
INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS IN THE USE OF SUBJECT LITERATURE AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN SCHEMES. IN CONTRAST WITH THE UNIVERSITIES, THE MAJORITY
OF DEMANDS FOR EXTERNAL MATERIAL CAME FROM STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY EXAMINATION
CANDIDATES, RATHER THAN FROM TEACHERS. THE ORDERING OF MONOGRAPHS IS
INCREASING BUT PERIODICALS ARE THE TYPE OF LITERATURE MOST IN DEMAND. IT IS
VITAL THAT ALL COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO NATIONAL
INTERLOAN SCHEMES.
THE NEEDS OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
     
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANS BECAUSE
THEY USUALLY WORK ALONE OR WITH VERY FEW COLLEAGUES AND NEED ASSOCIATIONS TO
STAY IN TOUCH WITH OTHER LIBRARIANS AND WITH CHANGES IN LIBRARIANSHIP. THE
NEEDS FOR CONTACT WITH COLLEAGUES, FOR UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE, AND SKILLS, FOR
COOPERATION THROUGH INTERLIBRARY LOANS AND NETWORKS, AND THROUGH PROVISION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS, FOR INFLUENCING LEGISLATION, FOR FORMULATING AND
PROMOTING STANDARDS, AND FOR PERSONAL STATUS AND ACHIEVEMENT ARE DISCUSSED.

SUMMARISES THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED' SELECTION AND ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL,
RESOURCE SHARING, REFERENCE, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND TECHNICAL CURRENT AWARENESS
BULLETINS, AND SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
FOR BOTH USERS AND STAFF ARE OUTLINED, AND THE NECESSITY FOR INTEGRATED
INFORMATION NETWORKS TO MAXIMISE USE OF RESOURCES URGED.
TRENDS IN INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION RESOURCE CENTERS.
     
INFORMATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY CORPORATION'S RESOURCES. ONLY
RECENTLY, HOWEVER, HAS EMPHASIS BEEN PLACED ON THE INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS
KINDS OF INFORMATION SERVICES OFFERED IN THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT. A TREND
HAS EMERGED TO VIEW THE VARIETY OF INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES FROM A
GENERAL SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE, TERMED 'INFORMATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT' (IRM). A
MAJOR CONCERN OF TOP MANAGEMENT IS TO EDUCATE USERS IN INFORMATION AS A
CORPORATE RESOURCE.
THE CHRISTELIJK LEKTUUR CENTRUM (CHRISTIAN LITERATURE CENTRE), OR' AN ATTEMPT
AT A CHRISTIAN CONTRIBUTION.
     
THE CHRISTELIJK LEKTUUR CENTRUM WAS FOUNDED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN 1968 AS
SUCCESSOR TO THE BOND VAN CHRISTELIJKE OPENBARE LEESZALEN EN BIBLIOTHEKEN
(ASSOCIATION OF CHRISTIAN PUBLIC READING ROOMS AND LIBRARIES). THE AIM OF THE
CENTRE WAS TO PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF A NETWORK OF PROTESTANT-ORIENTED PUBLIC
LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, AT THE TIME OF THE CENTRE'S
FOUNDATION A NUMBER OF LIBRARIANS HAD PROPOSED THAT A SINGLE NATIONAL
ORGANISATION FREE FROM RELIGIOUS BIAS BE CREATED TO SUPERVISE LIBRARY AFFAIRS
IN THE NETHERLANDS. AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSALS THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN
LECTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) WAS FORMED IN
1972. THE CLC WAS ABSORBED INTO THE NEW ORGANISATION AS A SEPARATE SUB-GROUP
AND THROUGH THE NBLC HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROMOTE THE POSITION OF THE PROTESTANT
CHURCH IN LIBRARY AFFAIRS.

OUTREACH IN THE NETHERLANDS' AN EXPERIMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO
DISADVANTAGED GROUPS WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE ROLE OF THE NEDERLANDS
BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM.
     
A STUDY OF THE GROUP APPROACH TO LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGED IN THE
NETHERLANDS IS GIVEN AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF GENERAL PUBLIC LIBRARY
PROVISION BOTH PAST AND PRESENT.
THE DISADVANTAGED ARE CONSIDERED IN ESPOO.
     
SINCE 1970 ESPOO PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE HAD A HOUSEBOUND SERVICE. 52 PEOPLE ARE
SERVED NOW AND THEY BORROWED 3,293 BOOKS IN 1980. IN 1981 THE LIBRARY
ORGANISED AN OPEN DAY FOR THE HOUSEBOUND CUSTOMERS. DURING THE YEAR OF THE
DISADVANTAGED, AN ADDITIONAL SUM OF 40,000 FINNISH MARKS WERE GRANTED TO ESPOO
PUBLIC LIBRARIES FOR ACQUIRING AIDS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED. A WORKING GROUP
DEALING WITH THE AREA HAS CONTACTED ORGANISATIONS WORKING FOR THE
DISADVANTAGED FOR ADVICE AND INFORMATION. THE WORKING GROUP RECOMMENDED THAT
LIBRARIES SHOULD TRY TO BUY THE FOLLOWING' TEXT TV'S, LISTENING AIDS FOR
TALKING BOOKS, HEARING AIDS, MAGNIFYING GLASSES, MAGNIFYING COLD AIR LAMPS,
WHEELCHAIRS, AND WALKING AIDS.
LIBRARIES, LIBRARIANS AND DISABLED PERSONS: HELPING OR HANDICAPPING?.
     
DISCUSSES THE EFFORTS OF LIBRARIANS TOWARD CREATING AN AWARENESS OF, AND
INITIATING A RESPONSE TO, THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF THE PRINT-HANDICAPPED. THESE
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF LIBRARIANS, WHO
THROUGH INDIVIDUAL AND COMMITTEE ENDEAVOURS HAVE MANAGED TO AROUSE THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE PROFESSION AND FORCE IT INTO MEANINGFUL ACTION. THE
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED HAS EMPHASISED THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO
FIRSTLY UNDERSTAND AND SECONDLY CATER FOR THE NEEDS OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE.
LIBRARY WORK WITH THE ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED.
     
BONN PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE HOUSEBOUND WAS CREATED
15 YEARS AGO. IT IS ORGANISED BY THE LIBRARIAN OF A BRANCH LIBRARY
SPECIALISING IN LARGE PRINT MATERIAL AND PROGRAMMES OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE
ELDERLY. THE LIBRARIAN VISITS ALL PROSPECTIVE READERS TO FIND OUT THEIR
REQUIREMENTS; CLOSE PERSONAL CONTACT BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS IS ESSENTIAL.
EACH OF THE 180 READERS IS VISITED ONCE IN EVERY 4 WEEKS, WHEN BOOKS ARE
ISSUED, RENEWED OR RETURNED WITHIN A SPECIALLY SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM. THE BRANCH
LIBRARY SUPPLIES ABOUT 80% OF THE STOCK AND PUBLISHES AN ANNUAL LIST OF LARGE
PRINT BOOKS HELD. THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR THESE READERS IS POOR SIGHT SO LARGE
PRINT BOOKS ARE ESSENTIAL; BOOKS SHOULD ALSO NOT BE HEAVY SINCE SOME READERS
HAVE DIFFICULTY HOLDING THEM.
NEW AIDS FOR THE READING HANDICAPPED.
     
DESCRIBES AIDS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WITH HANDICAPS AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO
READ. FOR SOME VISUALLY DISABLED, ENLARGEMENT OF THE TEXT BY MEANS OF OPTICAL
INSTRUMENTS IS ENOUGH. A CORRECTLY ADJUSTED STAND AND LIGHTING ARE IMPORTANT.
FOR THE MORE SEVERELY VISUALLY HANDICAPPED, SIGHT AMPLIFIERS, CONSISTING OF A
VIDEO CAMERA AND TV RECEIVER, ARE AVAILABLE. VARIOUS TAPE RECORDERS AID THE
BLIND. PAGE TURNING DEVICES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE MOBILITY HANDICAPPED.
MENTIONS A NEW AID FOR THE DEAF' IR-EQUIPMENT, USING INFRA-RED LIGHT,
CONSISTING OF A MICROPHONE, A TRANSMITTER AND A LISTENING DEVICE (STETOCLIP).
VIDEOFILMS WITH SIGN LANGUAGE ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SOCIAL SECURITY. A
TEXT TELEPHONE BY MEANS OF WHICH INCOMING CALLS APPEAR AS TEXT IS BEING
DEVELOPED. LIBRARIES SHOULD BE DESIGNED WITH THE HANDICAPPED IN MIND, WITH
READING CORNERS AND STUDY CARRELS EQUIPPED WITH AIDS.
REFLECTIONS ON A VISIT TO THE UNION OF THE BLIND OF CROATIA, ZAGREB,
YUGOSLAVIA.
     
PRIOR TO ATTENDING THE 1981 MEETINGS OF THE IFLA ROUND TABLE OF LIBRARIES FOR
THE BLIND, IN LEIPZIG (EAST GERMANY), THE AUTHORS VISITED THE UNION OF THE
BLIND OF CROATIA IN ZAGREB, YUGOSLAVIA.
LITERATURE PROVISION AND LIBRARIANSHIP FOR THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED IN THE
NETHERLANDS.
     
FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON BOOKS FOR THE
MENTALLY HANDICAPPED IN APR 80 IN THE NETHERLANDS THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) APPOINTED A
STAFF-MEMBER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROVISION OF BOOKS FOR THE HANDICAPPED. AT
THE SAME TIME THE NBLC SET UP A WORKING PARTY TO CREATE CONTACTS WITH
PUBLISHERS, AUTHORS AND ILLUSTRATORS, TO ADVISE ON LIBRARY WORK WITH THE
MENTALLY HANDICAPPED AND TO REVIEW THE SUITABILITY OF NEW BOOKS FOR THIS
GROUP. AS A RESULT OF THE WORKING PARTY'S EFFORTS SOME LIBRARIES HAVE SET
ASIDE SPECIAL OPENING TIMES FOR THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARY WORK WITH
THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED IS NOW TAUGHT AS PART OF THE COURSE AT SEVERAL DUTCH
LIBRARY SCHOOLS.
EDUCATIONAL CENTRES-A NEW CHALLENGE TO LIBRARIES.
     
DESCRIBES THE EDUCATIONAL CENTRE IN GENTOFTE, DENMARK, WHICH AIMS TO BE FOR
CHILDREN'S INSTITUTIONS (CRECHES, NURSERIES, DAY AND YOUTH CENTRES, ETC.) WHAT
THE RESOURCES CENTRES ARE FOR SCHOOLS. THE CENTRE, OPENED IN AUG 80, EMPLOYS A
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN WITH EXPERIENCE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS AND AN
INSTRUCTOR. THE MATERIAL CONSISTS OF 50 SUBJECT SETS CONTAINING EDUCATIONAL
TOYS, FILMS, SLIDES, AND BOOKS. FILM PROJECTORS, CAMERAS, EPISCOPES AND OTHER
VISUAL EQUIPMENT ARE ALSO LENT. OFFSET PRINTING IS AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE
INSTITUTIONS. THE CENTRE ARRANGES WORKSHOPS INVOLVING CHILDREN AND INSTRUCTORS
IN PRODUCING FILMS, AND THEATRICAL AND FILM SHOWS. URGES LIBRARIES TO
COOPERATE IN ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH CENTRES AND MAKE DEPOSITS OF BOOKS
AVAILABLE.
SELECTED RESEARCH RELATED TO CHILDREN'S AND YOUNG ADULT SERVICES IN PUBLIC

MORE CLEARLY SHOW RECENT TRENDS THE CONTENT HAS BEEN DIVIDED HISTORICALLY AT
THE 1970 DATE.
DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BOOKRACK AWARD 1981.
     
THE BOOKRACK AWARD FOR 1981 WAS AWARDED TO AASE BREDSDORFF, A FORMER INSPECTOR
OF LIBRARIES FOR HER OUTSTANDING WORK IN MAKING LITERATURE ACCESSIBLE TO
CHILDREN AND IN PROMOTING THE ASSOCIATION'S AIM OF PROVIDING CHILDREN AND
YOUNG PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION THROUGH LIBRARIES. THE
PERSON AWARDED THE BOOKRACK HOLDS IT FOR THE YEAR AND RECEIVES A COPY OF THE
BOOK NOMINATED, WHICH FOR 1981 WAS 2STEMPLERNE1 BY JOHN NEHM.
DEVELOPMENT AID FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES-ADVISORY WORK AND SEMINARS IN THE
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS.
     
IN MAY 81, FOR THE 1ST TIME, WEST GERMANY GAVE AID TO LIBRARIES IN A
DEVELOPING COUNTRY. IN CYPRUS, SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE USUALLY IN BETTER
CONDITION THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE CYPRIOT LIBRARIANS ASKED GERMANY FOR HELP
WITH PROBLEMS OF INSUFFICIENT QUALIFIED STAFF, OUTDATED AND INADEQUATE STOCKS,
SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE NEED TO INTEGRATE THE LIBRARY INTO THE SCHOOL
CURRICULUM. SEMINARS WERE ARRANGED TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCUSSION AND
TO HELP LIBRARY STAFF TO REALISE THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL. A
REPORT WAS WRITTEN FOR THE DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR TECHNISCHE ZUSAMMENARBEIT
(THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR TECHNICAL COOPERATION) CONTAINING SUGGESTIONS FOR
DEVELOPING SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND STAFF TRAINING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
NATIONAL LIBRARY PLANNING IN CYPRUS, WHICH IT IS HOPED WILL BE PUT TO
PRACTICAL USE.

SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND TEACHERS IN 3 SCHOOLS ARE DESCRIBED, WITH DETAILS IN
EACH CASE OF' LIBRARY ATMOSPHERE AND LAYOUT; PERSONNEL; BUDGET; BOOK AND
NON-BOOK MATERIALS; ORGANISATION OF MATERIALS; LIBRARY PROGRAMMES; AND
CLASSROOM COLLECTIONS. CONCLUDES WITH AN OVERVIEW OF PRESENT LIBRARY
FACILITIES AND PRESENTS GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AS A

THE LIBRARY IN THE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL.
     
SOME OF THE ISSUES CURRENTLY CONFRONTING LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED FROM THE
PERSPECTIVE OF THE LIBRARIAN IN AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL, INCLUDING AUTOMATION,
CENSORSHIP, COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION, EVALUATION, INSURANCE, AND NETWORKS. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES IN A PRIMARY SCHOOL LIBRARY.
     
HINTER BURG PRIMARY SCHOOL HAS A LIBRARY WITH 5,000 BOOKS AND ALSO RECORDS,
SLIDES, CASSETTES AND EDUCATIONAL FILMS. THERE IS NO QUALIFIED LIBRARIAN, BUT
THE TEACHERS RUN THE LIBRARY WITH REASONABLE SUCCESS. MORE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR
STOCKS, FOR EXPANSION AND BECAUSE BOOKS WEAR OUT QUICKLY. THE CHILDREN ARE TOO
YOUNG TO STUDY INDEPENDENTLY THERE BUT THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED TO USE
BOOKS. ALL CLASSES EXCEPT THE LOWEST HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY INSTRUCTION IN THE
LIBRARY. THERE IS ACTIVE COOPERATION WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY; THE
LIBRARIAN ADVISES ON PURCHASES AND ARRANGES MUSIC AND STORY-TELLING SESSIONS
FOR THE CHILDREN. GOOD CONTACTS WITH PARENTS AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAVE ALSO
PROVED HELPFUL.
WHAT DO STUDENTS READ IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES?.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE JOINT MEETING OF THE STUDY GROUPS ON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
AND LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES IN ESSEN, JUNE 81. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TURN 1ST
TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FOR THE BOOKS THEY NEED BUT THEY ALSO FORM A LARGE
READER GROUP IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF A UNIVERSITY TOWN. RECENT SURVEYS MADE
IN COLOGNE AND BOCHUM REVEAL THAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS A DOUBLE FUNCTION FOR
STUDENTS, COVERING BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED LITERATURE DEMANDS. THE
STUDENTS SHOW GREAT INTEREST IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS AND THEIR
INTEREST IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EQUALS THAT OF THE REST OF THE GENERAL
PUBLIC. THEY BORROW LESS FICTION THAN OTHER READERS, ALTHOUGH THEY DO USUALLY
DEMAND WORKS OF HIGH LITERARY QUALITY AND THEY ARE ATTRACTED BY BRANCH LIBRARY
STOCKS AS WELL AS BY THOSE IN CENTRAL LIBRARIES.
HOW DO YOU GET ON WITH THE STUDENTS?.
     
THERE ARE OVER 34,000 STUDENTS AT BONN UNIVERSITY, 60% OF WHOM LIVE IN THE
TOWN, SO THAT THEIR NEEDS MUST BE CATERED FOR BY BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
STUDENTS FROM COLOGNE AND AACHEN UNIVERSITIES ALSO MAKE USE OF BONN'S LIBRARY
SERVICES. IF A STUDENT CANNOT FIND THE REQUIRED MATERIAL IN THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY HE TURNS TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR HELP. IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HE
FINDS THE ADVANTAGES OF LONG OPENING HOURS AND OF ALL MEDIA ON OPEN ACCESS. IN
1980 15.73% OF ALL LOANS IN BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE MADE TO UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS; THEY USED MAINLY ACADEMIC MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY SOCIOLOGY. THE STATE
PROVIDES 13.1% OF TOTAL LIBRARY FUNDS FOR SPECIALISED MATERIAL.
INFORMATION AND WORKERS.

READERS AND THEIR READING TRENDS IN THE BRITISH COUNCIL LIBRARY, DELHI.
     
TO FIND OUT THE READING TRENDS OF THE READERS OF THE BRITISH COUNCIL LIBRARY,
DELHI, A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TAKING THE BOOKS BORROWED DURING 28 JAN-9 FEB 80
ON MONDAYS, WEDNESDAYS, FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS AS A SAMPLE. RESULTS OF THE
SURVEY HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH TABLES AND CHARTS. THE SURVEY INDICATES THAT
THE LIBRARY IS FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY, AND THE STUDENTS ARE THE LARGEST
SINGLE GROUP OF USERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS STRONG DISCONTENT AMONG ALL
CATEGORIES OF BORROWERS ABOUT THE MODERN FICTION COLLECTION. IT HAS BEEN
CONCLUDED THAT THE SURVEY WILL BE MOST HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE BOOK SELECTION
POLICY OF THE LIBRARY.
A PROCEDURE FOR DEVELOPING A TYPOLOGY OF ADULT USERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
REPORTS THE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF 2 DIFFERENT STYLES OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY USE. ADULTS WHO PRACTICE THESE STYLES APPEAR TO DIFFER IN THEIR
PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOURS, IN THE LIBRARY SERVICES WHICH THEY
USE, AND IN THEIR EVALUATIONS OF THE LIBRARY. A DESCRIPTION OF A TYPOLOGY OF
USERS BASED UPON THESE STYLES HAS APPLICATION IN LIBRARY USER STUDIES.
EFFECTS OF MAKING LONGER OPEN-HOURS ON THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY USERS.
     
THE SAITAMA MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY EXTENDED ITS HOURS UNTIL 8PM IN NOV 79. THE
EFFECT OF THE EXTENSION WAS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS
ENTERING THE LIBRARY BETWEEN THE PERIODS OF NOV 78 THROUGH APR 79, AND NOV 79
THROUGH APR 80. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENTERING THE LIBRARY
INCREASED FOR EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK EXCEPT FRIDAYS; THE OVERALL PEAK LIBRARY
HOURS INCREASED BY 1 HOUR AND EXTEND BETWEEN 12 NOON TO 5PM, INSTEAD OF THE
PREVIOUS 12 NOON TO 4PM. THE STATUS ANALYSIS OF THE LIBRARY PATRONS SHOWED AN
INCREASE IN EVERY CATEGORY, AND THE PEAK LIBRARY HOURS FOR STUDENTS EXTENDED
BETWEEN 12 NOON AND 5PM, INSTEAD OF THE PREVIOUS 12 NOON TO 3PM. THE PEAK
HOURS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF DID NOT CHANGE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING AND LIBRARIES.
DESCRIBES THE LINKS BETWEEN RENFREW DISTRICT LIBRARIES AND THE BBC ADULT
LITERACY PROJECT. IN 1975, THE SCOTTISH ADULT LITERACY AGENCY AWARDED THE
LIBRARIES A *6500 GRANT TO PROVIDE ADULT LITERACY MATERIALS, AND BBC PROMOTION
MATERIALS WERE USED TO EXTEND THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES. THE BBC SHOWED GREAT
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE PROJECT AND SELECTED PAISLEY AS A VENUE FOR THE ROADSHOW
PROGRAMME-A SUCCESSFUL VENTURE, ALTHOUGH IT OVERSIMPLIFIED THE SERVICES AND
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES MUST RESPOND TO THE INTEREST
GENERATED BY THE MEDIA, BY PROVIDING RESOURCES, STUDY FACILITIES, AND
PROFESSIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED OF LIBRARIANS BY INDIVIDUALS IN AN OPEN LEARNING
SITUATION.

ONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF SELECTED
PROFESSIONALS. SUMMARISES THE INTERVIEW FINDINGS OF THE 5 PAPERS IN THIS
SPECIAL SECTION. EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS HIS SPECIAL INFORMATION NEEDS AND EACH
WORKS IN A FIELD IN WHICH CURRENT INFORMATION IS BOTH ESSENTIAL AND OFTEN HARD
TO LOCATE. CO-WORKERS ARE THE MOST OFTEN CONSULTED INFORMATION SOURCES, AND
LIBRARIES WERE RARELY IF EVER USED FOR ON THE JOB NEEDS-PERHAPS THERE IS
LITTLE OR NO ROLE FOR THE LIBRARY IN THIS SPHERE FOR MANY WORKERS. LIBRARY
STAFF, TOO, CONSULT CO-WORKERS WHEN PLANNING THE LIBRARY'S REFERENCE
ACTIVITIES. POTENTIAL USERS KNOW WHAT THEY NEED. LIBRARIANS NEED TO KNOW THE
EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN FILL THOSE NEEDS.
COLLECTION EVALUATION' A MANAGERIAL TOOL.
     
DISCUSSES THE BENEFITS TO BE GAINED FROM CONDUCTING A COLLECTION EVALUATION
STUDY IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY. SURVEYS VARIOUS METHODS OF EVALUATION WHICH HAVE

AUTHORS IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS REFINED AND APPLIED. HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE
AUTHORS ARE FOUND TO BE HIGHLY PROLIFIC. IN COMPUTATIONAL MUSICOLOGY, HOWEVER,
PRODUCTIVITY DOES NOT IMPLY COLLABORATION, LENDING CREDENCE TO THE TRADITIONAL
BELIEF THAT HUMANISTS TEND TO WORK ALONE.
EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL BASES OF ZIPF'S LAW.
     
REVIEWS RESEARCH INTO ZIPF'S LAW AND CONCLUDES THAT THERE ARE, AT PRESENT, FEW
APPLICATIONS OF THE LAW TO THE DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS BUT THAT SUCH
APPLICATIONS MAY DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE.
OBSOLESCENCE.
     
REVIEWS THE LITERATURE OF RESEARCH INTO OBOLESCENCE. CONCLUDES THAT, ALTHOUGH
PRACTICAL RESULTS OF RESEARCH TO DATE ARE OF LITTLE VALUE OR USE IN DAILY
LIBRARY OPERATIONS, THIS SITUATION COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE.
CITATION ANALYSIS.
     
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF CITATION ANALYSIS CONCENTRATING ON ITS DEVELOPMENT
AS A RESEARCH METHOD, USES AND ABUSES OF THE METHOD AND PROSPECTS FOR THE
FUTURE.
BRADFORD'S LAW' THEORY, EMPIRICISM AND THE GAPS BETWEEN.
     
THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MATCH THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL
STUDIES OF BRADFORD'S LAW ARE DISCUSSED.
A HOME FOR HISTORICAL TREASURES.
     
THE CONNECTICUT HISTORICAL SOCIETY IN HARTFORD IS 1 OF THE OLDEST HISTORICAL
SOCIETIES IN THE USA. IT MAINTAINS A STAFF OF 3 PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS TO
OPERATE THE LIBRARY FOR HISTORICAL AND GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH. AMONGST ITS
COLLECTIONS THE SOCIETY POSSESS AROUND 75% OF THE MORE THAN 5,000 ITEMS
ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN PRINTED WITHIN CONNECTICUT'S BORDERS BEFORE 1800. IT
ALSO HOUSES A LARGE AND IMPORTANT COLLECTION OF EARLY AMERICAN CHILDREN'S
BOOKS. A LARGE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTION AND FINE MUSEUM ARE ALSO HOUSED BY THE
SOCIETY.
CHINESE COLLECTIONS IN THE U.S.A.
     
A REPORT OF A STUDY TRIP IN 1979, SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION FOR
FRANCO-AMERICAN CULTURAL EXCHANGE TO INVESTIGATE CHINESE COLLECTIONS IN U.S.
LIBRARIES. BASED ON VISITS TO SIX LIBRARIES AND ATTENDANCE AT THE ANNUAL
CONFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE ON EAST ASIAN LIBRARIES. THE CHIEF PROBLEM IN THE
U.S.A. IS LACK OF FINANCE, WHICH AFFECTS ACQUISITION PROGRAMMES, PERSONNEL,
AND STORAGE, WITH CONSEQUENT DELAYS IN PROCESSING AND CATALOGUING ACTIVITIES.
ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS INITIATION OF ATTRACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
TO ATTRACT FINANCE, AND USE OF VOLUNTARY STUDENT LABOUR, ARE DESCRIBED.
GREATER COOPERATION SEEMS ESSENTIAL, AND IT IS PROPOSED THAT A PROGRAMME OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN U.S. AND PARIS LIBRARIES SPECIALISING IN CHINESE MATERIAL
BE IMPLEMENTED.
THE ARRANGEMENT AND DESCRIPTION OF ARCHIVAL MATERIALS.
     
THE WORK IS DIVIDED INTO 3 MAIN SECTIONS DEALING WITH; MANUSCRIPT TEXTUAL
MATERIAL (INCLUDING PUBLIC RECORDS); OTHER MEDIA (INCLUDING PRINTED MATERIAL,
SOUND ARCHIVES AND MACHINE READABLE ARCHIVES; AND PLANNING.
THE WORKING PARTY ON UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES IN QUEBEC (QUEBEC CONFERENCE OF
UNIVERSITY RECTORS AND PRINCIPALS).
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1980 CONGRESS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CANADIAN
ARCHIVISTS, BY A MEMBER OF THE WORKING PARTY ON UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES IN QUEBEC,
ONE OF SEVERAL SPECIALIST COMMITTEES CREATED BY CREPUQ. DESCRIBES HOW THE
GROUP CAME INTO BEING IN 1977, AND ITS INITIAL MANDATE. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF
PARTICIPANT REPRESENTATION, AND ACTIVITIES TO DATE AT 12 MEETINGS. TOPICS
COVERED ARE SUMMARISED, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE LAW ON PHOTOGRAPHS AND
RECORDS MANAGEMENT. IN CONCLUSION THE ADVANTAGES OF THE GROUP AS COMPARED TO A
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION ARE DISCUSSED.
A CANADIAN AT THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOY LIBRARIES.
     
AN INFORMAL REPORT ON THE STOCKHOLM 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF TOY
LIBRARIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE OCCUPATIONS AND NATIONALITIES OF
PARTICIPANTS, AND THE PROGRAMME OF ACTIVITIES OUTLINED. DESCRIBES THE LECTURE
TOPICS, STUDY VISITS TO SWEDISH TOY LIBRARIES, AND A WORKSHOP ON 'HOW TO
ORGANISE NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS'. CONCLUDES WITH NOTES ON TOY LIBRARY SERVICES
IN HOLLAND, ITALY, MAURITIUS, AND NEW ZEALAND, DRAWN FROM CONFERENCE LECTURES.
FRENCH MAP LIBRARIES AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS.
     
THE SITUATION OF MAP COLLECTIONS IN FRANCE IS NOT WELL KNOWN, AND THEIR PLACE
IN FRENCH DATA SYSTEMS IS LIMITED. HOWEVER SOME ACTIONS IN PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING AND 2 IMPORTANT EXHIBITIONS, DEVOTED TO EARLY AND MODERN MAPS, HAVE
FOR SOME YEARS DRAWN ATTENTION TO MAP COLLECTIONS. DISCUSSES THE
ADMINISTRATION OF MAP COLLECTIONS AND VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS WHICH
ARE CONCERNED WITH MAPS AND RELATED SUBJECTS. ALSO MENTIONS THE WORK OF THE
WORKING GROUP ON MAP LIBRARIES SET UP BY THE COMITE FRANCAIS DE CARTOGRAPHIE
(CFC).
THE GEOGRAPHICAL SECTION OF THE NATIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ROME.
     
THE NATIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ROME POSSESSES A RICH COLLECTION OF ANCIENT
AND MODERN MAPS. SOME 19,000 HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND CATALOGUED AND ARRANGED
ACCORDING TO 3 GROUPINGS' CHRONOLOGICALLY FOR MAPS FROM 1500 TO 1800; BY
COLLECTION FOR MAPS FROM OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE BODIES; AND GEOGRAPHICALLY FOR
ALL THE OTHERS. IN A NEW RE-ARRANGEMENT, MAPS WILL BE CATALOGUED BY A SINGLE
CRITERION FOR EVERY LOCALITY AND TYPE, WHETHER PRINTED OR IN MANUSCRIPT.
AUTHOR AND TOPOGRAPHICAL CATALOGUES WILL BE COMPILED. TRANSFER OF THE SECTION
TO A NEW SITE HAS ALLOWED PROVISION FOR A STUDY ROOM SPECIALISING IN
GEOGRAPHY, CONTAINING AUTHOR, TOPOGRAPHIC AND CONCORDANCE CATALOGUES FOR WORKS
ON DISPLAY. CLASSIFICATION SCHEDULES ARE GIVEN AS AN APPENDIX.
MAPS IN THE U.S. SERIAL SET 1817-1917' A STATISTICAL ESTIMATE.
     
THE U.S. SERIAL SET CURRENTLY CONTAINS OVER 13,000 VOLUMES AND COMPRISES
PRINCIPALLY HOUSE AND SENATE REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS. IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME
PAPERS PRINTED BY ORDER OF CONGRESS AND SOME REPORTS ISSUED BY THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH. MATERIAL DATES FROM 1817 TO THE PRESENT. USING RANDOM SAMPLING
TECHNIQUES, THE AUTHORS ESTIMATED THAT THE 1817-1917 SECTION CONTAINS
APPROXIMATELY 29,244 MAPS. DISCUSSES HOW A MAP INDEXING PROJECT COULD BE
INITIATED AND SUGGESTS A COOPERATIVE VENTURE, WHEREBY EACH PARTICIPANT INDEXES
THE MAPS IN A SEGMENT OF THE SERIAL SET, USING AGREED PROCEDURES AND A
STANDARDISED WORK SHEET.
CANADIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS' AN UPDATE.
     
COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL MICROPUBLISHING PROGRAMMES COMBINE TO DELIVER THE
VAST DOCUMENT OUTPUT OF CANADIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND CROWN
CORPORATIONS. FOCUSES ON MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT SERIALS, COM BIBLIOGRAPHIES
AND MICROFICHE DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICES.
SELECTION CRITERIA FOR PERIODICALS IN MICROFORM.
     
THE NEED FOR MORE CARE IN CHOOSING WHICH PERIODICALS TO PRESERVE IN MICROFORMS
IS SUGGESTED, AND CRITERIA FOR THIS CHOICE ARE OUTLINED.
THIS IS THE WAY RUC HAS ORGANISED RECORDING OF TV.
     
DESCRIBES ROSKILDE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S VIDEOTAPE COLLECTION. SOME RECORDINGS
WERE MADE FROM THE START OF THE LIBRARY IN 1971, BUT THEY WERE USUALLY
DELETED. GRANTS FOR MODERN VIDEO-CASSETTE RECORDERS IN 1973 AND THE NEW
COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1977 MAKING IT LEGAL TO RECORD RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMES FOR
EDUCATIONAL USE ENABLED THE LIBRARY TO ORGANISE RECORDING AND USE IN A SYSTEM
PARALLEL TO THAT FOR BOOKS. DISCUSSES THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF WHO MAY
RECORD, WHAT MAY BE RECORDED, RESPONSIBILITY FOR POSSIBLE COMPENSATION, FREE
RIGHT TO LEND, DUTY TO DELETE. ARGUES THAT NOW THAT THE LEGAL QUESTION IS
CLEARED UP, PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES SHOULD ORGANISE A SYSTEM FOR
ACQUISITION, REGISTRATION, CATALOGUING AND LENDING OF RECORDINGS SIMILAR TO
THAT FOR BOOKS. DESCRIBES ROSKILDE'S SOLUTION. ORDERS FOR RECORDING OF DANISH
AND SWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES ARE RECEIVED FROM STAFF AND STUDENTS AND SOME
RECORDING IS DONE ON THE LIBRARY'S OWN INITIATIVE. AFTER  RECORDING,
REGISTRATION IS DONE ON THE BASIS OF THE PROGRAMME TITLE. SUBJECT ENTRIES ARE
MADE NOT ACCORDING TO UDC, BUT TO THE LIBRARY'S OWN ESTIMATE OF USERS' NEEDS.
IMPACT OF OTHER DISCIPLINES ON INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF IDEAS
ORIGINATING FROM WITHIN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND THOSE FROM
OTHER DISCIPLINES. 12 MOST CITED JOURNALS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL (SOURCE SPECIALTIES) WERE CHOSEN FOR CITATION ANALYSIS. FROM THESE
JOURNALS, 40 ARTICLES WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE LAST COMPLETE YEAR AND
THEIR REFERENCES RECORDED, RESULTING IN 1,159 CITATIONS. THE ANALYSIS
CONSISTED OF MEASUREMENTS OF SELF-CITATION, CROSS-FERTILISATION (PROPORTION OF
CITATIONS MADE BY ONE TO THE OTHER SOURCE SPECIALTY), AND OPENNESS (THE DEGREE
TO WHICH A SPECIALTY IS OPEN TO THE IDEAS OF OTHER DISCIPLINES). REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
HERE THE GRASSROOTS ARE STORED IN ARCHIVES.
     
DESCRIBES A VISIT BY DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENTS TO AMSTERDAM. THE GROUP
SAW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL INFORMATION AT AMSTERDAM UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE
DEPARTMENT BEGAN IN 1969 WITH THE GIFT OF THE 'PROVO' MOVEMENT'S ARCHIVES; IT
NOW SERVES AS AN ARCHIVES AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE FOR MATERIALS OF SOCIAL
MOVEMENTS FROM THE WHOLE WORLD. THE MATERIALS RANGE FROM BOOKS AND RECORDS TO
BADGES AND T-SHIRTS. SUCH UNUSUAL MATERIALS DEMAND UNTRADITIONAL METHODS OF
ACQUISITION, REGISTRATION AND RETRIEVAL; NONE OF THE STAFF WAS QUALIFIED IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. DESCRIBES AN ALTERNATIVE ADVICE CENTRE OR 'LEGAL SHOP'
(RECHTSWINKEL), STAFFED BY VOLUNTEER LAW STUDENTS. A VISIT WAS PAID TO THE
VRIJE ARCHIEF, AN ARCHIVE WHICH AIDS SQUATTERS' ACTIONS BY MAKING AVAILABLE
TOWN PLANNING INFORMATION. LIBRARY METHODS AND COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WERE NOT REGARDED AS OF VALUE TO ANY OF THESE CENTRES, AND
AMSTERDAM'S MAIN PUBLIC LIBRARY, HOUSED IN A NEW BUILDING, B UT LACKING
LITERATURE ON COMMUNITY INFORMATION, WAS NOT PLANNING TO COOPERATE WITH THE
CENTRES EITHER.
POLITICAL LITERATURE IN LIBRARIES OF THE RUSE REGION.
     
FROM 1974-79, SECTIONS OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN 312 SELECTED PUBLIC, TRADE
UNION AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN THE RUSE REGION WERE THE SUBJECT OF A
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. 2,018 READERS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AND 191
WERE INTERVIEWED. THE PROPORTION OF POLITICAL LITERATURE IN THE TOTAL BOOK
COLLECTIONS IS ON AVERAGE 20%. THE PEOPLE WHO STUDY POLITICAL LITERATURE ARE
PREDOMINANTLY STUDENTS OR PUPILS. REGRETTABLY, ONLY 31.7% OF THE READERS USED
LIBRARIES AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THEIR NECESSARY LITERATURE. MASS
MEDIA AND EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS PLAY A MUCH GREATER PART IN THIS RESPECT.
THE DESIRABLE TURNOVER OF POLITICAL LITERATURE, THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES,
AND THE DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE BOOKS ARE ALSO COVERED. ON THE WHOLE, THE
LIBRARY SERVICE IS PERFORMING A VALUABLE ROLE IN POLITICAL EDUCATION, BUT EVEN
SO, THERE IS LITTLE ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY.
ARCHIVAL RESOURCES ON LABOUR RELATIONS IN THE UNIVERSITE LAVAL ARCHIVE
DIVISION.
     
DESCRIBES 11 ARCHIVE COLLECTIONS ON LABOUR RELATIONS AT LAVAL UNIVERSITY, IN
THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE ARCHIVE DIVISION'S POLICY OF
ESTABLISHING HOLDINGS OF SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENTS RELATING TO QUEBEC IN THIS
FIELD, AND PROCEDURES FOR ACQUISITION. FOR EACH COLLECTION, TECHNICAL DETAILS
ARE GIVEN, A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE PERSONS OR GROUPS INVOLVED, AND A SUMMARY OF
THE CONTENTS. HOLDINGS INCLUDE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS FROM TRADE UNIONS, PROMINENT
TRADE UNIONISTS, AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.
AN UNUSUAL SUBJECT LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES A BIOLOGY LIBRARY FOR SENIOR PUPILS IN A GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE LIBRARY
IS OPEN ALL MORNING; PUPILS MAY COME IN FREELY TO STUDY, BORROW BOOKS AND
PHOTOCOPIES AND EXAMINE SPECIMENS. THEY CAN MAKE COFFEE THERE AND CHAT TO
THEIR FRIENDS. ALTHOUGH THE PUPILS THEMSELVES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUES, VERY
FEW BOOKS HAVE BEEN LOST. THERE ARE ABOUT 500 BOOKS, INCLUDING REFERENCE BOOKS
AND TEXTBOOKS, FREQUENTLY WITH MULTIPLE COPIES. IN 1979-80, 150 SENIOR PUPILS
BORROWED, ON AVERAGE, 4 BOOKS EACH. GENERAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE DIVIDED
INTO SUBJECT LIBRARIES RUN BY DEPARTMENTAL HEADS. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
SMALL, CLEARLY ARRANGED AND FREELY ACCESSIBLE.
ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION MICROFICHE.
     
THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN MAKING
AVAILABLE IN MICROFICHE ITS RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION OF ENERGY-RELATED
PUBLICATIONS. AS AN AID TO ACCESSING THESE DOCUMENTS, THE AUTHOR HAS COMPILED
A LIST CORRELATING EIA REPORT NUMBERS TO THEIR SUDOCS CLASSIFICATION AND
2AMERICAN STATISTICS INDEX 1ACCESSION NUMBERS.
ART TO THE PEOPLE.
     
ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN MAKING THE PUBLIC
FAMILIAR WITH ART. THE 1964 DANISH LIBRARY ACT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ART
DEPARTMENTS AND SEVERAL LARGER LIBRARIES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS, LENDING
MOSTLY PRINTS, POSTERS AND SLIDES. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS NOW STAGNATED OWING TO
VARIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS. THUS ART NEED NOT BE PLACED IN SPECIAL BUILDINGS ONLY
VISITED BY HIGHLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE. A LIBRARY SHOULD BEGIN BY LENDING POSTERS,
WHICH ARE EASY TO HANDLE, AND THEN PROCEED TO PRINTS. ART NEED NOT BE
EXPENSIVE, A POSTER COSTING NO MORE THAN A BOOK, AND LARGE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT
NECESSARY. WHEREAS ACQUISITION OF POSTERS IS SIMPLE, PRINTS AND SLIDES DEMAND
MORE ATTENTION AS CENTRAL AIDS TO SELECTION OF MATERIAL ARE LACKING.
EXHIBITIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR WIDENING PEOPLE'S CONCEPTION OF ART. REGRETS
THAT THE NEW DANISH LIBRARY BILL OMITS ANY MENTION OF ART.
MUSIC JOURNALS IN THE LIBRARY.
     
MUSIC, AS A TOPIC OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN JOURNAL LITERATURE, IS DISCUSSED
HISTORICALLY, DESCRIPTIVELY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHICALLY. THE BROAD RANGE OF TITLES
REFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF AMATEURS AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALS, AND SELECTED
SOURCES FOR INFORMATION AND EVALUATION ARE PROVIDED TO ASSIST LIBRARIANS IN
SELECTING APPROPRIATE JOURNALS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF USERS.
HISTORICAL RESEARCH. A GUIDE TO SELECTED LIBRARY INFORMATION AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF TENNESSEE, KNOXVILLE.
     
ORIENTED TOWARD THE HISTORICAL RESEARCHER, THIS GUIDE SELECTIVELY INTRODUCES
MAJOR AVAILABLE USA, UK AND WEST EUROPEAN RESOURCES. ANNOTATED FOR USEFULNESS
AND CONTENT, THESE MATERIALS ARE BROADLY ORGANISED IN CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO
THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE. INCLUDED ARE RESEARCH GUIDES;
ENCYCLOPEDIAS, DICTIONARIES, AND TABLES; BIBLIOGRAPHIES; INDEXES AND
ABSTRACTS; BIOGRAPHICAL SOURCES; STATISTICS; NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES; BOOK
REVIEWS; DISSERTATIONS; ATLASES AND GAZETTEERS; PORTRAITS AND PICTORIAL
SOURCES; GUIDES TO LIBRARIES, ARCHIVES, AND MANUSCRIPTS; GOVERNMENT
PUBLICATIONS; AND AN AUTHOR TITLE INDEX. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY (IN ARABIC).
     
DISCUSSES THE USES OF PALEOGRAPHY AND THE SOURCES OF ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY WHICH
INCLUDE' OLD COPIES OF THE KOR'AN; PAPYRUS LEAVES; MEMORIAL INSCRIPTIONS; OLD
TOMBS; OLD COINS AND DRESSES; WOOD, CLAY, POTS AND RINGS; LETTERS AND WRITINGS
ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARABIC PALEOGRAPHY; SOME OF THE CLASSIC BOOKS ABOUT IT;
AND THE SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC PALEOGRAPHY. ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, AND
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARAB LETTER PRINTING ARE DISCUSSED.
RECENT DOCUMENTATION FOR THE STUDY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
     
IN RECENT YEARS MUCH CAPTURED OR PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT INFORMATION
ABOUT THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE PRE- AND POST-WAR YEARS HAS BEEN PUBLISHED
IN MICROFORMAT. PRESENTS A DESCRIPTIVE, SELECTED SURVEY OF THESE MAJOR
DOCUMENTS AND GROUPS OF RECORDS NOW AVAILABLE.
THE LIBRARY'S ADMINISTRATIVE BODY: CLEAR GUIDELINES NOW!.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT ENVISAGES CULTURAL COMMITTEES AS ADMINISTERING
LIBRARIES. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY COMMITTEES MAY SURVIVE, BUT AS EXCEPTIONS AND IN
CONFLICT WITH OFFICIAL POLICY. THE LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE IS UNSATISFACTORY. A
MINISTRY OF CHURCH AND EDUCATION DOCUMENT (1979) OUTLINES DIVISION OF
RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN LIBRARIAN AND CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION. LIBRARIANS MUST
INSIST ON SEVERAL PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. IF THESE STIPULATIONS ARE UPHELD, AND
GUIDELINES DRAWN UP WITH THE SUPPORT OF LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS, LIBRARIES MAY
SURVIVE.
THE INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE.
     
PRESENT-DAY LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS FACE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF ECONOMICS,
POLITICS, AND TECHNOLOGY. ADEQUATE FUNDING IS IN SHORT SUPPLY WHILE LIBRARIANS
DO NOT ACT EFFECTIVELY IN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY THREATENS
TO LEAD LIBRARIANS RATHER THAN FOLLOW. USING THE ANALOGY OF A BUSINESS OFFICE,
THE AUTHOR PROPOSES AN INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE WITH 3
COMPONENTS; THE LIBRARY, THE JOB, AND THE HOME.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND NETWORKS' PROSPECTIVE ROLES AND
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LIBRARIES IN NEW JERSEY. 19TH REPORT.
     
THE COMMISSION CONCLUDE THAT A REVISION OF LIBRARY LAWS AND AID PROGRAMMES IN
NEW JERSEY IS NECESSARY TO COMBAT THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION, GROWTH OF
INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON THE ABILITY OF PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED
LIBRARIES TO FULFIL THEIR ROLES IN SOCIETY.
ELEMENTS TO BE INCORPORATED IN LIBRARY NETWORK LEGISLATION.
     
DRAFTED BY THE NEW JERSEY STATE LIBRARY, THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL PRESENTS
DETAILED PROVISIONS FOR THE GOVERNANCE AND SUPPORT OF A STATE LIBRARY NETWORK.
IT CREATES A HIERARCHICAL NETWORKING STRUCTURE TO INCLUDE LIBRARIES OF ALL
TYPES, DEFINES SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES TO BE ADMINISTERED, AND ESTABLISHES
ADMINISTRATIVE AND FUNDING MECHANISMS. ADDITIONAL PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS
OUTLINED WHICH REFLECTS THE CONCERNS OF COUNTY LIBRARIES, PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
AND REGIONAL FILM CENTRES, AND INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATEWIDE
RECIPROCAL BORROWING PROGRAMME. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN LOCAL COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS.
     
DEALS WITH NETWORKING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR MEMBER LIBRARIES OF A
COOPERATIVE SYSTEM IN NEW YORK STATE. AFTER DESCRIBING BRIEFLY LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATE, DISCUSSES THE HISTORY, ORGANISATION, AND FINANCING
OF THE NASSAU LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SERVICE PROGRAMME OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTLINED,
AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE THEN RELATED TO STATEWIDE, REGIONAL, BICOUNTY, AND
LOCAL ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL LIBRARY SERVICE. THE PROBLEMS
OF NEW YORK SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ARE MENTIONED, AND THE BENEFITS OF
PARTICIPATION IN A SYSTEM PROGRAMME ARE DISCUSSED.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND NETWORKING' A BIBLIOGRAPHIC ESSAY.
     
MOST OF THE LITERATURE ON THE PARTICIPATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN COOPERATIVE
ACTIVITIES DEALS WITH THEIR EXPANSION FROM LOCAL ENTITIES TO MULTITYPE
SYSTEMS. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS EVOLUTION, TOPICS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
HAVE BEEN' APPROPRIATE UNITS OF SERVICE; LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS;
STIMULUS OF LEGISLATION; ROLE OF STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES; FINANCIAL ASPECTS;
HUMAN FACTORS; AND AUTOMATION IN NETWORKING. THE LITERATURE REVIEWED WAS VAST
BUT WAS DEFICIENT IN COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESES, IN RIGOROUS, LARGE-SCALE
EVALUATION OF NETWORKING, AND IN STUDIES FOCUSING SOLELY ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
POLITICS OF LOCAL INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION.
     
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES ARE KEY FACTORS IN DEVELOPING COOPERATION AMONG US
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. EXPERIENCES IN PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION HAVE SHOWN THAT
THE ACCEPTANCE OF COOPERATION AS AN IDEAL, PATRON REACTION AND ACCEPTANCE,
LOCAL PRIDE AND CONTROL, AND THE EDUCATION AND COOPERATION OF THE LIBRARY
BOARD, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND FUNDING AGENCIES ARE ALL IMPORTANT IN
PROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATION. THE COMMITMENT TO AND
UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS, CHANGES, AND MODIFICATIONS THAT COOPERATION
REQUIRES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. REALISATION THAT INTERPRETATION OF WHAT
COOPERATION MEANS AND THAT UNEQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE EXPECTED ARE NECESSARY
STEPS IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING VIEWED FROM A STATE LIBRARY AGENCY.
     
ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, US STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES HAVE PLAYED A
MAJOR ROLE IN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKING
ACTIVITIES AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER TYPES
OF LIBRARIES. THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A GREAT VARIETY OF
WAYS, WITH EACH STATE REACTING TO ITS OWN DEMOGRAPHIC, GOVERNMENTAL, AND
LIBRARY REALITIES. THE FEDERAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT HAS BEEN
A MAJOR CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE ENABLING STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES TO BE EFFECTIVE
LEADERS IN COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKING ACTIVITIES. STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WORKING TOGETHER CAN CONTINUE TO EXTEND LIBRARY SERVICES BY
TAKING LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKING ACTIVITIES.
SCHOOL/PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION. A STATE OF THE ART REVIEW.
     
THIS REVIEW IS PRESENTED AS A RESPONSE TO MAJOR QUESTIONS RELATED TO SCHOOL
AND PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION. ITS SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO' (1) INDICATE
THE PRESENT STATUS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES; (2)
PRESENT A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE WITHIN WHICH TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS OF
CURRENT EFFORTS; (3) IDENTIFY FUTURE TRENDS AND DIRECTIONS; (4) POINT OUT
BARRIERS TO COOPERATION AND FACTORS LEADING TO ITS SUCCESS; (5) SUGGEST
OUTSTANDING SOURCES WHICH CONTAIN RELEVANT INSIGHTS ABOUT SCHOOL/PUBLIC
LIBRARY COOPERATION; AND (6) IDENTIFY SOME REPRESENTATIVE COOPERATIVE
ACTIVITIES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
THE AMALGAMATION OF A SMALL AND A LARGER LIBRARY.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY OF VLAGTEWEDDE, WHICH WITH A
POPULATION OF 16,500 INHABITANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED UNDER THE DUTCH
PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT TO SURRENDER ITS LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE COUNTY COUNCIL,
COMBINED IN 1978 WITH THE NEARBY TOWN OF STADSKANAAL WITH A POPULATION OF
34,000 TO PROVIDE A JOINT LIBRARY SERVICE. THE COMBINED LIBRARY SERVICE NOW
HAS ITS MAIN LIBRARY AT STADSKANAAL, 5 BRANCH LIBRARIES AND A MOBILE LIBRARY
WITH A TOTAL COLLECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 135,000 BOOKS AND RECORDS. THERE ARE
16,600 REGISTERED BORROWERS AND LOANS IN 1980 TOTALLED 750,000. LIBRARY
SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE REGION HAVE BEEN IMPROVED BY THE CREATION OF
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SCHOOLS AND BY THE SETTING UP OF A LIBRARY SERVICE
FOR HOUSEBOUND READERS.
ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT' STATEMENT OF ACHIEVEMENTS BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
THE IDEA THAT INCREASES IN LOANS AND STOCKS WOULD BRING ABOUT PROPORTIONAL
INCREASES IN FINANCE, ACCOMMODATION AND STAFF HAS PROVED INCORRECT. STATISTICS
ON LOANS AND STOCKS CONCEAL WEAKNESSES WITHIN A LIBRARY AND THE UNFULFILLED
WISHES OF READERS. THERE IS NO PROSPECT AT PRESENT OF A LIBRARY LAW AND SALARY
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE STOPPED. ONLY 10% OF THE POPULATION USE LIBRARIES' MORE
DEDICATED LIBRARIANS ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP SOCIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. FREEDOM IN
BOOK SELECTION IS OFTEN THREATENED BY THE ATTITUDE OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BY
CONDITIONS ON THE BOOK MARKET. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GERMANY HAVE DEVELOPED NOT
IN A UNIFIED FASHION BUT THROUGH A VARIETY OF HISTORICAL CAUSES. THE BEST CURE
OF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE AN OPEN AND CRITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN LIBRARIANS
AND POLITICIANS.
THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES.
     
CONTAINS 2 REPORTS ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION
SERVICES; 'THE ORGANISATIONAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK' AND 'WORKING TOGETHER
WITHIN A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK'. THE FIRST REPORT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTER
FOR THE ARTS IN 1979 AND IS CONCERNED MAINLY WITH LIBRARIES. THE SECOND REPORT
WAS SUBMITTED IN 1981 AND IS CONCERNED MAINLY WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEW
TECHNOLOGY TO LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES AND WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IN
COOPERATION AT LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.
THE LONG RANGE PLAN FOR STATEWIDE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN CONNECTICUT,
1980-1985.
     
PREPARED TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT
(LCSA) PL 95-123, THIS LONG-RANGE PLAN PRESENTS LIBRARY SERVICE GOALS AND
OBJECTIVES FOR THE CONNECTICUT LIBRARY SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS. THE
BACKGROUND OF LONG RANGE PLANNING, THE PLANNING PROCESS, AND PROBLEMS TO BE
OVERCOME ARE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR
PROGRAMMES AND EXPENSES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
BUILDING THE FUTURE. THE ALABAMA LONG RANGE PROGRAM FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT,
1980-1984.
     
BASED PRIMARILY ON IDENTIFIED NEEDS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR
THE CITIZENS OF ALABAMA, THIS REPORT DISCUSSES LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NEEDS
IN THE CONTEXTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SPECIAL
CONSTITUENCIES, AND INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION; PROVIDES A DETAILED OUTLINE OF
THE MISSION, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM; AND
DETAILS THE POLICIES, CRITERIA, PRIORITIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ALLOCATION
OF LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT (LSCA) FUNDS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE
FROM NTIS.
A FIRE IN THE DEBATE ABOUT THE NEW LIBRARY BILL.
     
DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY BILL PROPOSED BY THE DANISH CHRISTIAN PEOPLES' PARTY, A
MINORITY PARTY WHOSE PROPOSAL HAS NO CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW, BUT MIGHT YET
INFLUENCE THE RULING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' PROPOSAL. THE C.P.P. SUPPORTS THE
LIBRARY COMMISSION'S MINORITY REPORT AND PREFERS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE
ADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS, WHILE RESEARCH, EDUCATIONAL
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES COME UNDER THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. BUT UNLIKE THE
MINORITY REPORT, IT SUGGESTS THAT NO NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES SHOULD RECEIVE STATE SUPPORT, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE
INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY WHETHER TO CHARGE FOR THESE OR FINANCE THEM OUT OF THE
LOCAL RATES. EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE LENDING OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS TO THE DISABLED. IT SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY
AND ITS DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON BOOK SELECTION. A BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM OF
FINANCING WOULD ALSO AID LOCAL INDEPENDENCE.
INFLEXIBLE CONTROL SYSTEM.
     
COMPLAINS OF THE NECESSITY FOR NORWEGIAN BRANCH LIBRARIES TO MAKE SEPARATE
ANNUAL RETURNS TO SATISFY THE COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE.
1 COORDINATED REPORT COMPILED BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.
SEPARATE RETURNS CAN BE POSITIVELY MISLEADING, SINCE, FOR INSTANCE, BOOKS
TRANSFERRED OR CIRCULATING WITHIN A LIBRARY SYSTEM CANNOT BE ACCURATELY
RECORDED. PUTS FORWARD PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE TIME SPENT ON STATISTICS; THE
TYPE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN SOCIETY WERE TO BE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A SALARIED COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS. BOOKSTOCK STANDARDS
WOULD ALSO BE MORE VIABLE IF FORMULATED FOR 1 AUTHORITY, WITH THE NECESSARY
DIVISIONS INTO CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES. THE STATUS AND FUNCTION OF THE
COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE IS QUERIED, AND THE RIGHT OF WORKERS'
ORGANISATIONS TO REPRESENTATION ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL IS STRESSED.
COPYRIGHT AND A RESERVE READING ROOM' FROM MENACE TO OFFICE ROUTINE.
     
DISCUSSES THE EFFECTS OF THE US COPYRIGHT REVISION ACT OF 1976 ON THE SERVICE,
BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND OFFICE PROCEDURES OF THE PENN STATE UNIVERSITY'S
LIBRARY RESERVE READING ROOM. DESCRIBES HOW THE LIBRARY, WHICH HELD A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MULTIPLE COPIES OF PHOTOCOPIED MATERIAL DEALT WITH THE
NEW LAW'S SECTION OF LIBRARY REPRODUCTION. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS
WHICH WERE FOUND TO THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE ACT, INCLUDING' PURCHASING BACK
ISSUES, REPRINTS OR ADDITIONAL COPIES OF BOOKS; AND MORE FULLY TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE UNIVERSAL SERIALS AND BOOK EXCHANGE. INDICATES SOME ISSUES
REGARDING THE COPYRIGHT LAW AND RESERVE ROOMS THAT NEED RESOLUTION.
MBO AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
WINDSOR, CONNECTICUT HAS A PUBLIC LIBRARY STAFFED BY 5 PROFESSIONALS AND 10
CLERICAL PERSONNEL. IN 1975, THE TOWN OF WINDSOR AND THE LIBRARY AS ONE OF ITS
DEPARTMENTS, ADOPTED MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES. REVIEWS THE SUCCESSES AND
FAILURES OF MBO IN THE CONTENT OF THE LIBRARY. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES WERE PUT
IN WIDE FUNCTIONAL COMPARTMENTS-COLLECTION MANAGEMENT, CIRCULATION MANAGEMENT,
LIBRARY PROMOTION, INFORMATION SERVICES, AND EVENTS MANAGEMENT. DESCRIBES THE
PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF OBJECTIVES. WHILST
LIBRARY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT BEEN OVERLY INTERESTED IN MBO, THE RAISING OF
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND THE ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THEM MORE THAN JUSTIFIES ALL
THE TOIL THAT MBO HAS REQUIRED.
SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR VIRGINIA LIBRARIES.
     
THE REPORT IS DESIGNED TO (1) EDUCATE NON-LIBRARIANS AS TO HOW VIRGINIA
LIBRARIES ARE FUNDED, (2) INFORM LIBRARIANS OF FUNDING OUTSIDE THEIR
PARTICULAR SPECIALTY, (3) SUGGEST THE ADEQUACY AND INADEQUACY OF SUCH FUNDING
AND ITS DEPENDABILITY, AND (4) OUTLINE THE FORMULAS BY WHICH FUNDS ARE
DISTRIBUTED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
ARE COUNTY LIBRARIES THREATENED?.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT REPORT NOU 1979 PROPOSES THAT FROM 1981 STATE GRANTS
TOWARDS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CEASE, BEING REPLACED BY ADDITIONAL TAX
INCOME. THE INTENTION IS TO SIMPLIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND
INCREASE THE COUNTIES' ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTONOMY.
CONCENTRATING ON TECHNICAL DETAILS, THE REPORT IGNORES THEIR EFFECT ON
PROFESSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREAS CONCERNED. CULTURAL WORK IS DEFINED AS
A VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY FOR COUNTIES, NOT REQUIRING OR MERITING STATE SUPPORT;
LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ALREADY UNDER SOME DEGREE OF STATE SUPERVISION.
STATE SUPPORT HAS BEEN A STIMULUS TO CULTURAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, AND ITS
REMOVAL WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP. THE PROPOSALS, IF IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT
FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, COULD
LEAD TO GREATLY VARYING STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES,
ALSO AFFECTING SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION. THIS WOULD BE DI RECTLY COUNTER TO
THE 'EQUALITY PRINCIPLE' IN THE CURRENT LIBRARY ACT.
THE ALLOCATION OF STATE FUNDS TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA.
     
(DLS THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY.) DISCUSSES THE EVOLUTION OF
CALIFORNIA'S STATE POLICY REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES
WHICH BEGAN WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON LIBRARY PROBLEMS OF
THE ASSEMBLY INTERIM COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FROM 1953-57. THIS LED TO THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY COMMISSION IN 1957. TRACES THE WORK OF
THE COMMISSION AND THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON COOPERATION BETWEEN SMALL LIBRARIES
IN ORDER TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE.
PRICING OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
OPPORTUNITIES AND PROBLEMS CONFRONTING A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS PRICING
DECISION ARE RELATED TO ITS PRICING OBJECTIVES. EXAMINES 6 OBJECTIVES OF PRICE
AND IDENTIFIES THE LIKELY OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OBJECTIVE. THESE
OBJECTIVES ARE MARKET EQUITY, SOCIAL EQUITY, MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR
PARTICIPATION, MAXIMISING REVENUE, RATIONING, AND COMMERCIAL SECTOR
ENCOURAGEMENT. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A LIBRARY WILL HAVE ONE OVERALL PRICING
OBJECTIVE WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE SERVICES IT DELIVERS. THE PRICE
ULTIMATELY ADOPTED FOR ANY PARTICULAR SERVICE WILL DEPEND ON WHICH OBJECTIVES
ARE UPPERMOST IN PRIORITY AND WILL REPRESENT THE BEST COMPROMISE AMONG
CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES.
SYMPOSIUM ON GOVERNMENT, FINANCE AND LIBRARIES.
     
MARGARET SKED DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN THE
LIGHT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN CURRICULA AND TEACHING METHODS AND CUTS IN LOCAL
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE IN SCOTLAND WHICH ARE HITTING EDUCATION PARTICULARLY
HARD. ERIC SIMPSON DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND THE EFFECTS ON
THEIR BUDGETS OF CUTS IN LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. NORMAN TURNER
BRIEFLY STRESSES THE NEED TO CONVINCE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE VALUE OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WHEN ALLOTTING FUNDING.
GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND LEVEL OF SERVICES OF RESEARCH
LIBRARIES.
     
COMMENTS ON THE SECTIONS OF A REPORT BY THE RESEARCH PLANNING COUNCIL' 2THE
CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR1 WHICH DEAL WITH RESEARCH
LIBRARIES. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE REDUCTION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR
ACQUISITION OF LITERATURE HAS LED TO SEVERE PROBLEMS FOR RESEARCH. ANALYSIS OF
THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970S SHOWS INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE ON STAFF AND FALL
IN THE REAL VALUE OF THAT FOR ACQUISITIONS, TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLING OF
ISSUES. THE COMEMNTS ON LIBRARIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT, BUT CAN
BE CLASSED AS THOSE THAT MENTION' LIBRARIES WITHOUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION,
OR LIBRARIES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT YET ARISEN, AND LIBRARIES WITH
CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. ARTS FACULTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBJECTS AND
FOREIGN SPECIALISED LITERATURE COINCIDING WITH A DECREASE IN BOOK GRANTS. IN
THE NATURAL SCIENCE FACULTIES, INSTITUTE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACQUIRE
BOOKS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM A RESEARCH LIBRARY; GAPS
ARE APPEARING IN RUNS OF PERIODICALS, AND REFERENCE WORKS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.
SERVICE LEVEL HAS GONE DOWN AS A RESULT OF UNDERMANNING OF LIBRARIES. SOME
LIBRARIES, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE COMMERCIAL HIGH
SCHOOLS, STAND OUT AS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT' THE LOCAL VIEWPOINT.
     
DISCUSSES CUTS IN THE BUDGETS FOR LIBRARIES IN SCOTLAND IN THE LIGHT OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S CUTS IN PUBLIC SPENDING. ARGUES THAT MORE EFFICIENT AND SLIMMER
SERVICES WILL BE NEEDED IN FUTURE WHICH ARE MANNED BY MORE HIGHLY SPECIALISED
AND ADAPTABLE LIBRARIANS WHOSE SERVICES ARE RECOGNISED BY ADEQUATE PAY LEVELS.
STRESSES THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR SERVICES AND MEANS OF MEASURING LEVELS OF
PERFORMANCE.
LONG RANGE BUDGET PLANNING IN LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT IF A LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY MAKES A PRACTICE OF GATHERING
INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BUILD BUDGET REQUESTS, THE TIME CONSUMING DATA
GATHERING CAN BE REDUCED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BY EXAMINING THE OVERALL
REQUESTED GROWTH RATE FOR THE SYSTEM AND ADJUSTING THE FIGURES WHERE NEEDED TO
BRING IT IN LINE WITH WHAT IS FEASIBLE. THE ADJUSTED FIGURES CAN THEN BE
RETURNED TO THE REQUESTING LIBRARIANS FOR THEM TO SEE WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED AS
A REQUEST. DEMONSTRATES HOW, IN TIMES WHEN FUNDS ARE SCARCE, THIS PRACTICE
WILL ACT AS AN INFORMATIONAL AND DECISION-MAKING TOOL AND WILL SERVE TO ADJUST
LIBRARY NEEDS TO ZERO-BASE BUDGETING PRACTICES.
WORD PROCESSOR (HERMES WP-6000) AND ITS APPLICATION TO LIBRARY WORK.
     
A WORD PROCESSOR, HERMES WP-6000, WAS INSTALLED IN TOKYO METROPOLITAN
GERONTOLOGY CENTER LIBRARY IN FEB 80. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS ARE PROVIDED FOR
THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS, WHICH INCLUDE A CRT DISPLAYER, DISK DRIVE, KEYBOARD, A
PRINTER AND A FLOPPY DISK. THE LIBRARY APPLICATIONS OF WORD PROCESSORS ARE
EXPLORED IN THE AREA OF CATALOGUE CARD PRODUCTION, BOOK CATALOGUE PRODUCTION,
AND CURRENT FOREIGN SERIAL RECORD MAINTENANCE.
THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES' IDEAS FOR A NEW VIEWPOINT.
     
ALTHOUGH LIBRARIANS FORMERLY ADOPTED A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE WHEN INTRODUCING
AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING, ITS USE RESULTED IN ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND MORE
INTERESTING WORK FOR SOME STAFF. THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING CAN,
HOWEVER, CAUSE STRESS AND MONOTONY, THE CONTROL OF WORK AND HUMAN POTENTIAL BY
MACHINES, INCREASED ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THE DOWNGRADING OF SOME LIBRARY
POSTS AND THE LOSS OF A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE FOR READERS. IF THE HUMAN TOUCH IS
TO BE RETAINED IN LIBRARIES, NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. GOOD COMMUNICATION
MUST BE DEVELOPED BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS AND BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS. STAFF
WORK MUST BE REORGANISED AND THE TENDENCY TO GIGANTISM IN THE USE OF
AUTOMATION AVOIDED.
COMPUTER BASICS FOR LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.
     
AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT ON COMPUTERS AND DATA PROCESSING WHICH PROVIDE A BROAD
OVERVIEW OF THE FIELD, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THE
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE COMMUNITY. MANY ASPECTS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
ARE DISCUSSED RANGING FROM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CONCEPTS TO PERSONNEL AND
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. SECTIONS ON STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS AND PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGES STRESS ISSUES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN LIBRARY COMPUTING SYSTEMS.
AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE TOPICS COMMONLY
IGNORED IN BOOKS DEALING WITH LIBRARY AUTOMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, OPERATING
SYSTEMS AND THE INTERNAL METHODS OF COMPUTER MEMORY MANAGEMENT ARE DISCUSSED.
THE EFFECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ON STAFF AND READERS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.
     
RESEARCH HAS CONCENTRATED ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND
NEGLECTED THE SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS, SO THAT OPINION ON THE POSITIVE AND
NEGATIVE EFFECTS IS SHARPLY DIVIDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF AUTOMATION IS TO
INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY PROCEDURES; SERVICE CHANGES ARE STILL
REGARDED AS SIDE-EFFECTS. AUTOMATION'S VALUE MUST BE JUDGED IN TERMS OF THE
AVERAGE NON-ACADEMIC READER. THE TIME SAVED FOR STAFF THROUGH AUTOMATION OF
ROUTINE PROCEDURES MUST BE USED FOR READER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, FOR WHICH
FURTHER STAFF TRAINING SHOULD BE PROVIDED. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCES IN THIS
FIELD FROM LIBRARIES ABROAD SHOULD BE STUDIED CAREFULLY.
MEDIA CONTROL REPORT WITHOUT PERSPECTIVES.
     
COMMENTS ON 2AUTOMATED MEDIA CONTROL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1A JOINT REPORT BY
THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS AND THE COMPUTER
COMMITTEE. THE WORKING PARTY ON PILOT PROJECTS DOES NOT DELINEATE LONG-TERM
PERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ITS PROPOSALS AS PART
OF A WHOLE. THE SWEDISH SITUATION OF 2 SEPARATE DATA SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESULTING IN DUPLICATION OF WORK AND UNDER-UTILISED
RESOURCES, MUST BE AVOIDED IN NORWAY; THE REPORT IS CRITICISED FOR NOT
CONSIDERING COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES TOGETHER. IT
ALSO FAILS TO SPECIFY THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERISATION ON LIBRARY STAFFS,
BORROWERS AND FINANCE. THE COMMITTEE REGARDS ISSUE CONTROL AS THE ROUTINE MOST
REQUIRING COMPUTERISATION, BUT MANY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES,
SUCH AS OVERDUE RECALL WORK. EASILY-AMASSED STATISTICS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO
BUILD UP EXTRA WORK. SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS FROM THE REPORT ARE SELECTED FOR
DETAILED COMMENT.
COMPUTERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
A NORWEGIAN COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE (SEPT 80) DEFINED 2 MAIN PURPOSES OF
AUTOMATION' (1) LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES; (2) INDEXING,
STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. NORWEGIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD
PROBABLY BEGIN WITH ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTINES AND PROCEED GRADUALLY, WHILE
DISCUSSING MAJOR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS' AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM; A
DECENTRALISED SYSTEM UTILISING CENTRAL SERVICES; LIBRARIES NOT USING COMPUTERS
THEMSELVES, BUT LARGELY DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERISED PRODUCTIONS. THE LIBRARY
CENTRE WILL EVENTUALLY ACT AS A DATA BASE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY LITERATURE AND A
CENTRE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY COMPUTER OPERATIONS. LOCAL SYSTEMS ARE VIABLE ONLY
FOR THE LARGEST LIBRARIES; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED LIBRARIES MUST BE LINKED TO
A CENTRAL AUTHORITY, AND HENCE TO THE RESOURCES OF THE LARGE LIBRARIES. PUBLIC
LIBRARIES MUST FORMULATE THEIR OWN POLICY FOR AUTOMATION, EVALUATING SYSTEMS
ACCORDINGLY.
GROUNDS FOR THE AUTOMATION PROPOSAL.
     
THE NORWEGIAN COMPUTER COMMITTEE WILL PRESENT A REPORT ON COMPUTERISATION IN
1982. THE ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS CONSIDERS THAT A DEFINITE
RULING ON ITS ATTITUDE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED BEFORE THEN.
STRESSING THAT IT DOES NOT OPPOSE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, THAT POTENTIAL USERS
MUST TAKE PART IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS, AND THAT STRICT QUALITATIVE
STANDARDS ARE NECESSARY, IT PRESENTS A 2-PART PROPOSAL RELATING TO TRADE
UNIONS AND LIBRARY POLICY.
THE ART OF RUNNING A DATA LIBRARY.
     
DATA TECHNOLOGY HAS APPEARED AT THE RIGHT TIME TO HELP LIBRARIANS WITH THE
GREATLY INCREASED WORKLOAD OF RECENT YEARS. RETROSPECTIVE LITERATURE SEARCHING
AND CURRENT LITERATURE AWARENESS, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BENEFIT GREATLY FROM
AUTOMATION. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE LIKELY IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL AND
COMMUNITY INFORMATION SERVICES, FULLER INDEXING TO AID IDENTIFICATION IN THE
HUMANITIES, CATALOGUING OF LOCAL COLLECTIONS, AND INDEXING OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD SET ABOUT INFORMING STAFF AND PUBLIC ON
THE QUESTION OF COMPUTERISATION; THE WORKING PARTY RECENTLY APPOINTED SHOULD
INTENSIFY THEIR DISCUSSIONS ON THE SWEDISH BUMS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND
AUTOMATION IN GENERAL; AND CONTACTS SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED ETWEEN CULTURAL AND
LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO DISCUSSING AUTOMATION IN SWEDISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
NTL'S COMPUTERISATION WORK AT OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
     
MEMBERS OF NORSK TJENESTEMANNLAG (THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC
SERVANTS) EMPLOYED IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SET UP THEIR OWN GROUP IN
1977-78, AND ESTABLISHED A WORKING PARTY TO DEFINE THEIR PROFESSIONAL POLICY
ON COMPUTERISATION. TOPICS HAVE INCLUDED DISCUSSION ON RECENT OFFICIAL
STATEMENTS ON THE FRAMEWORK OF DATA SYSTEMS; DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION TO
SHOP STEWARDS AND EMPLOYEES; TRAINING COURSES; LIAISON OFFICERS; CONTACT
MEETINGS; COOPERATION AMONG PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS IN OSLO UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY; STATEMENTS ON CONCRETE PROJECTS; DEMANDS REGARDING COMPUTERISATION
DEVELOPMENT; REPRESENTATION ON RELEVANT BODIES; WORKING CONDITIONS AND HOURS
AT TERMINALS; NEED FOR SPECIFIC STATEMENTS ON LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS;
ADMINISTRATION OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS; AND CONTACT WITH COLLEAGUES IN OTHER
LIBRARIES. IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES OF COMPUTER USE ARE AT A
COMPARATIVELY ADVANCED STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, SO FAR WITHOUT MAJOR CONS
EQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUAL STAFF. THE WORKING PARTY'S EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCED
GUIDELINES ON CERTAIN PROBLEMS, AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE COOPERATIVE BODY OF
WORK ON COMPUTERISATION BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS.
LIBRARY PLANNING FOR FUTURE NETWORKS.
     
AUTOMATION DEVELOPMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ARE VIEWED AS LEADING TOWARD
INVOLVEMENT IN NETWORKS. THE PRIMARY ISSUES OF MACHINE-READABLE RECORD
FORMATS, HOLDINGS FORMATS MECHANISMS FOR UPDATING MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASES,
AND SYSTEM INTERFACES FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND OPERATING SYSTEMS NEED TO BE
ADDRESSED IF THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE TO BE A STEP TOWARD THE LIBRARY'S
EVENTUAL NETWORKING CAPABILITIES. LIBRARIES AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS ARE
ALL PROGRESSING IN THEIR USE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, BUT NOT NECESSARILY
TOWARD A COMMON GOAL.
NETWORK ORGANIZATION' CURRENT STATUS AND CONCERNS.
     
DESCRIBES THE BASIC ASPECTS OF LIBRARY NETWORK ORGANISATION IN THE USA. PAYS
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE ORGANISATIONAL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT HAVE
BEEN DEVELOPED BY THESE NETWORKS. BOTH THE STATE AND MULTISTATE NETWORKS AND
THE 3 MAJOR NATIONAL NETWORK ORGANISATIONS (OCLC, INC., RLG/RLIN, AND WLN) ARE
DESCRIBED. IN ADDITION, ORGANISATIONAL ISSUES OF CURRENT CONCERN INCLUDING
JURISDICTIONAL PROBLEMS, NATIONAL COORDINATION, AND THE CONTROL AND DIRECTION
OF NETWORK ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED.
LIBRARY NETWORKS.
     
THE MOST EFFICIENT TYPE OF NETWORK HAS GLOBAL AS WELL AS LOCAL ELEMENTS THAT
PROVIDE SYSTEM STANDARDS AS WELL AS LOCAL FLEXIBILITY. SUCH A NETWORK
STRUCTURE IS NOW POSSIBLE DUE TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. THE RESULT OF THIS
DEVELOPMENT WILL BE THE INTEGRATION OF LARGE-SCALE LIBRARY SERVICES WITH THE
USER-ORIENTED SERVICES OF LOCAL LIBRARIES TO CREATE A NATIONAL INFORMATION
NETWORK.
LCS' AUTOMATED RESOURCE SHARING IN ILLINOIS.
     
THE LIBRARY COMPUTER SYSTEM (LCS) NETWORK IN ILLINOIS PROVIDES CIRCULATION
CONTROL FOR ITS MEMBER LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION, RESOURCE SHARING HAS BEEN
IMPLEMENTED BY ALLOWING EACH MEMBER LIBRARY TO SEARCH AND BORROW ITEMS FROM
THE COLLECTIONS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS. THE NETWORK IS COMPRISED OF THE 3
CAMPUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AND 14 OTHER ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN THE
STATE. THE COLLECTIVE LCS DATA BASE CONTAINS OVER 10 MILLION VOLUMES. EACH LCS
MEMBER LIBRARY CAN BETTER SERVE ITS PATRONS BECAUSE ITS ACCESS GOES BEYOND ITS
INDIVIDUAL COLLECTION TO THE ENTIRE LCS DATA BASE.
A VIEW OF THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY NETWORKING.
     
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY NETWORKS WILL INCLUDE GROWTH OF COMPUTER-BASED
NETWORKS IN NUMBER AND VARIETY OF LIBRARIES, IN USE OF VARIOUS SUBSYSTEMS, AND
IN SIZE OF DATA BASES USED. SERVICES PROVIDED BY ON-LINE SYSTEMS WILL EXPAND
TO INCLUDE IMPROVED SUBJECT ACCESS, ON-LINE CATALOGUES, SERIALS LISTS AND
INVENTORY CONTROL, ACQUISITIONS FUNCTIONS, INTERLIBRARY LENDING, CIRCULATION,
AND REFERENCE SERVICES. ADDITIONAL SERVICES WILL INCLUDE HOME DELIVERY OF
INFORMATION, TEXT TRANSMISSION, HOME-COMPUTING SUPPORT, LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS, AND INTERFACE BETWEEN BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. INCREASING INTERACTION
IS BREAKING OPEN THE ARTIFICIAL COMPARTMENTS IN WHICH LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS
HAVE SEEN THEMSELVES. THE DEMANDS PLACED ON LIBRARY PERSONNEL IN NETWORK
DEVELOPMENT WILL NEED CONTINUED EXERCISE OF SKILL, KNOWLEDGE, AND INTEGRITY AS
THE COLLECTIVE COMMON SENSE WORKS FOR THE COMMON GOOD.
OF NETWORKS AND VENDORS AND PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTOMATION.
     
A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE STATUS OF AUTOMATION IN US PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS
PRESENTED, STRESSING THE DEPENDENCE UPON NETWORKS AND VENDORS FOR ON-LINE
SYSTEMS. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A LIBRARY NETWORK ARE DESCRIBED. OCLC'S
CURRENT ROLE AS A NETWORK RATHER THAN AS A UTILITY IS DEFINED. A DESCRIPTIVE
REFERENCE TO OTHER LIBRARY NETWORKS IS INCLUDED. FINALLY, A COMPARISON OF
NETWORKS TO VENDORS IN A SERVICE RELATIONSHIP TO THE LIBRARY IS PRESENTED,
FOLLOWED BY A SHORT LIST OF PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTOMATION PREDICTIONS.
LIBRARIANSHIP RECRUITS: WHERE DO THEY GO?.
     
TABULATED AND ANNOTATED INFORMATION RELATING TO THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION FOR
AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY GRADUATES AS AT 30 APR 80. COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS RECENT
SURVEYS THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES OF UNIVERSITIES AND
COLLEGES OBTAINING PERMANENT FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DATA
IS MADE.
EQUIVALENCE OF LIBRARY QUALIFICATIONS' PROBLEMS.
     
HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEMS OF LACK OF EQUIVALENCE OF QUALIFICATIONS OBTAINED FROM
LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THE BARRIERS TO
THE FREE FLOW OF LIBRARIANS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. PRESENTS FINDINGS OF THE
COMMONWEALTH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S (COMLA) WORKING PARTY ON RECIPROCITY OF
QUALIFICATIONS PRESENTED IN 1975 AND CRITICISMS OF ITS REPORT AT A COMLA
SEMINAR. DISCUSSES STANDARDISATION OF COURSES INTERNATIONALLY AND SUGGESTS
THAT COMLA SHOULD RESEARCH STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL AND SUB-PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING, AS WELL AS SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND SHOULD PRODUCE AN UPDATED LIST OF
SCHOOLS REACHING THE REQUIRED STANDARDS. ALSO SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUAL
COUNTRIES COULD SET UP COMMITTEES TO ADVISE EMPLOYERS ON FOREIGN
QUALIFICATIONS.
A SURVEY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AND THEIR OPINIONS RELATED TO NINE-MONTH
CONTRACTS AND ACADEMIC STATUS CONFIGURATIONS IN ALABAMA, GEORGIA, AND
MISSISSIPPI.
     
REPORTS THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF 267 ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS CONDUCTED IN
ALABAMA, GEORGIA, AND MISSISSIPPI. DEMOGRAPHIC AND INSTITUTIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS AND OPINIONS OF LIBRARIANS WITH AND WITHOUT FACULTY STATUS
WERE STUDIED. PUBLICATION, RESEARCH, AND PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND
THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROMOTION OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WAS EXAMINED.
OPINIONS ON NINE-MONTH CONTRACTS, FACULTY STATUS, AND A COMPARABLE SYSTEM THAT
RECOGNISES THE UNIQUE NATURE OF RESPONSIBILITIES OF LIBRARIANS WERE SOUGHT.
THE MAJORITY OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH FACULTY STATUS,
AGREED WITH THE STATEMENT THAT A COMPARABLE SYSTEM WOULD BE A PREFERABLE MODE
OF ADVANCEMENT.
STRENGTHEN THE WORKERS' INFLUENCE.
     
THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS (KOMMUNALE
BIBLIOTEKARBEIDERES FORENING) HAS REGULARLY PUBLISHED ITS PERIODICAL
2KONTAKTEN, 1HAS DEVELOPED LIAISON WITH THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES (NKF), REPORTS SATISFACTORY BRANCH ACTIVITY, AND HAS OVER 600
MEMBERS. IT HAS HOWEVER NO REAL INFLUENCE ON LIBRARY POLICY. FURTHER ADVANCES
DEPEND ON INCREASED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP. IT IS AN
ESSENTIAL LINK BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
BETTER-ORGANISED COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARY BODIES IS IMPORTANT. THE
INFLUENCE OF LIBRARY WORKERS MUST BE STRENGTHENED IN MAJOR FIELDS CONCERNING
LIBRARY POLICY, SUCH AS THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL, LIBRARY EDUCATION, AND
COMPUTERISATION. THE INCOMING COMMITTEE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MEMBERS WITH TRADE
UNION EXPERIENCE AND AN INTEREST IN LIBRARY POLICY.
WE MUST ORGANISE MANY LOCAL GROUPS'.I
     
NTERVIEW WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY
WORKERS (KOMMUNALE BIBLIOTEKARBEIDERES FORENING), COVERING MAIN TASKS FACING
THE ASSOCIATION; ITS PROPOSED TRAINING COURSE FOR COUNTER ASSISTANTS; ITS
RESOURCES FOR PLANNED INVOLVEMENT WITH TRADE UNIONS, PROFESSIONAL MATTERS AND
LIBRARY POLICY; POSSIBLE OVERLAPPING WITH THE WORK OF THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION; THE COMPOSITION OF ITS COMMITTEE, WHOLLY LIBRARY WORKERS BELOW
THE RANK OF CHIEF LIBRARIAN; THE RANGE OF ASSOCIATIONS OPEN TO NORWEGIAN
LIBRARY WORKERS, THEIR POSSIBLE COORDINATION AND COMMON INTERESTS; EXPERIENCES
OF COOPERATION WITH SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK, AND GROUNDS
FOR EXTENDING SUCH ACTIVITIES; THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ASSOCIATION'S
CONSIDERING MEMBERSHIP OF IFLA; POLICY ON COMPUTERISATION, ESPECIALLY
REGARDING LIBRARY WORKING CONDITIONS, AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF SUCH
SPECIALISED SURVEYS ON THE ASSOCIATION'S INVOLVEMENT IN OTHER LIBRARY
MATTERS; AND CURRENT NON-REPRESENTATION OF EMPLOYEES' ORGANISATIONS ON
NATIONAL LIBRARY BODIES, WHICH CONSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY OF CHIEF LIBRARIANS.
PROFESSIONAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR MEDIA/LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS' DISTRICT AND SCHOOL.
     
THIS HANDBOOK DESCRIBING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS IT RELATES TO MEDIA/LIBRARY
PROFESSIONALS IN SCHOOL SYSTEMS PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING PROCESS, AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS OF THE VARIOUS PHASES' (1)
STRATEGIES AND PREPARATION FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, (2) NEGOTIATING THE
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, (3) A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF EXISTING
CONTRACTS THAT HAVE PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDIA/LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS, AND
(4) THE IMPACT OF THE MEDIA LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL ON MEDIA PROGRAMMES THROUGH
THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
UNPAID VOLUNTEERS AND PROFESSIONALS SIDE BY SIDE.
     
SINCE THE 2ND WORLD WAR THERE HAS BEEN A CLEAR TREND IN THE NETHERLANDS
TOWARDS PROFESSIONALISATION IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SERVICES. HOWEVER, IN
THE 1960S A REACTION CHARACTERISED BY THE GROWTH OF SELF-HELP ORGANISATIONS
TOOK PLACE AGAINST THE POST-WAR BUREAUCRATIC SOCIETY. WITH THE SUDDEN CHANGE
IN THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE 1970S
PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SERVICES CAME TO RESENT THE
USE OF UNPAID VOLUNTEERS AS A THREAT TO THEIR OWN POSITIONS. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH
VOLUNTARY WORKERS IN LIBRARIES MAY LACK PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE THEY ARE OFTEN
MORE SOCIALLY-MOTIVATED THAN THEIR PROFESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS. VOLUNTARY
WORKERS IN LIBRARIES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN DEMANDING AND USEFUL DUTIES BUT NOT
AT THE EXPENSE OF PAID LIBRARY STAFF.
CONTINUING EDUCATION AND THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN...IN THE ACADEMIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARY (IN ARABIC).
     
ARABIC TRANSLATION OF AN ARTICLE 1ST PUBLISHED IN 2LIBRARY JOURNAL1, 105 (22)
15 DEC 80. ATTEMPTS TO ADVANCE THE REEXAMINATION OF CONTINUING EDUCATION ON
BEHALF OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN IN THE ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARY.
REFERENCE MATERIALS, REFERENCE TECHNIQUES, INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS AND SUBJECT
KNOWLEDGE SHOULD ALL BE CONSIDERED IN CONTINUING EDUCATION IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THEY PERFORM, REFERENCE LIBRARIANS SHOULD
INTEREST THEMSELVES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION. THEY MUST ADAPT TO CHANGE OR THEY
WILL BECOME IRRELEVANT AND INCAPABLE OF GIVING PROPER SERVICE.
LEIRFJORD LIBRARY' A SMALL COMMUNITY GAMBLES HEAVILY ON ITS LIBRARY.
     
LEIRFJORD, NORWAY, HAS A SCATTERED POPULATION OF 2,200 AND SMALL FINANCIAL
RESOURCES. IN MAY 80 NEW LIBRARY PREMISES OPENED IN A FORMER COMMUNITY CENTRE.
ADULT AND CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS AND THE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE OCCUPY 127 SQ.M.
ON THE GROUND FLOOR, WHILE THE 1ST FLOOR WILL HOUSE STUDY-ROOMS, STACKS AND
STAFF FACILITIES. THE LOCAL AUTHORITY OBTAINED STATE HELP TOWARDS ALTERATIONS
AND EQUIPMENT, BUT OPERATIONAL COSTS ARE HIGH; HOWEVER, THE LIBRARY IS NOW
FULLY ACTIVE AND ITS USE IS STEADILY INCREASING.
GJOVIK LIBRARY AND OPPLAND COUNTY LIBRARY-SPLENDID NEW PREMISES, REDUCED
OPENING HOURS.
     
GJOVIK PUBLIC LIBRARY AND OPPLAND COUNTY LIBRARY, NORWAY, OPENED IN FEB 80 IN
A WING OF A CENTRALLY SITED COUNCIL BUILDING, ADJACENT TO THE CULTURAL CENTRE.
ITS AREA IS NOW 2084 SQ.M. IT IS OPEN-PLAN WITH SHELVES AS ROOM-DIVIDERS. THE
GROUND FLOOR HOUSES INTER-LIBRARY LOAN AND ADULT DEPARTMENTS; THE 1ST FLOOR
INCLUDES CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT, LOCAL COLLECTION, STUDY ROOMS AND A MEETING
ROOM. SINCE STAFFING HAS NOT BEEN AUGMENTED, OPENING HOURS HAVE HAD TO BE
REDUCED; IN SPITE OF THIS, LOANS HAVE INCREASED.
SPEYER MUNICIPAL LIBRARY IN NEW PREMISES.
     
IN 1980 A LARGE HOUSE BUILT IN THE 1870S WAS ADAPTED AT A COST OF 2.5 MILLION
DM TO HOUSE SPEYER PUBLIC LIBRARY AND ADULT EDUCATION INSTITUTE. THE NEW
LIBRARY, AT THE 2ND LEVEL OF THE NATIONAL NETWORK, STOCKS 50,000 ITEMS FOR A
TOWN OF 43,000 INHABITANTS. IT IS OPEN 24 HOURS PER WEEK AND ITS BUDGET FOR
1981 TOTALLED 70,000 DM. THE GROUND FLOOR CONTAINS THE ISSUE COUNTER, ADULT
FICTION AND NON-FICTION, PERIODICALS, MEDIA CENTRE, READING-ROOM, OFFICES AND
PROCESSING SECTION. THE 1ST FLOOR CONTAINS A SPACIOUS CHILDREN'S LIBRARY; THE
SPECIAL TEENAGE SECTION PROVIDES BOOKS, A CHESS CORNER AND FACILITIES FOR
PLAYING TAPES AND RECORDS. THE TOP FLOOR HOUSES A MEETING-ROOM AND MORE
OFFICES.
REPORT OF THE PREMISES COMMITTEE-MAIN POINTS FROM BODIES WHO HAVE EXPRESSED
OPINIONS ON THE REPORT.
     
THE REPORT OF THE NORWEGIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE'S COMMITTEE ON LIBRARY
PREMISES (FEB 80) WAS CIRCULATED TO MUNICIPAL AND COUNTY LIBRARIES, LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. THERE IS GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH
ITS PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT CONCERNED MORE
CONCRETE PROPOSALS FOR OUTREACH AND CATALOGUE DEPARTMENTS; LARGER MINIMUM
AREAS FOR PERIODICALS, READING PLACES AND YOUTH LIBRARIES; THE ADDITION OF
OFFICE ACCOMMODATION, AUDIO-VISUAL EQUIPMENT AND SEPARATE STUDY ACCOMMODATION
AS OBLIGATORY; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A 'RECOMMENDED' LEVEL OF PROVISION AND
THE LOWER 'APPROVED' LEVEL; RECOGNITION OF THE DANGER OF CLOSING SMALL
BRANCHES WITHOUT PROVIDING A SATISFACTORY ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS MOBILE
LIBRARIES; A MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE TO 'COMBINATION LIBRARIES'; QUERIES ON THE
STANDARDS FOR LARGER LIBRARIES; THE STATUS OF THE PRESENT TEMPORARY S
TANDARDS; AND THE DESIRABILITY OF FURTHER PROPOSALS ON STANDARDS FOR OPENING
HOURS AND STAFFING.
NEW LIBRARY PREMISES 1981.
     
IN 1981 22 FINNISH LIBRARIES GOT NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND 19 BUILDINGS WERE
RENOVATED. THE FOLLOWING GENERAL INFORMATION IS GIVEN ABOUT EACH SERVICE' SIZE
OF POPULATION OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY; NUMBER OF BRANCH LIBRARIES; NUMBER OF
INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES; NUMBER OF MOBILES. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ABOUT
THE NEW OR RENOVATED BUILDING IS GIVEN' TYPE OF BUILDING; SIZE OF POPULATION
SERVED; FLOOR SPACE; NUMBER OF BOOKS; NUMBER OF SOUND RECORDS; NUMBER OF
CASSETTES; NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS; NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF;
DESIGNER OF THE PREMISES; INTERIOR DESIGNER; AND WHEN THE BUILDING WAS OPENED
TO THE PUBLIC.
KRISTIANSAND NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
KRISTIANSAND NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY, NORWAY, OPENED SEPT 79, OCCUPIES 1000 SQ.M.,
FORMING 1 SIDE OF THE TOWN'S MAIN SQUARE. ITS MODERN DESIGN BLENDS EXTERNALLY
WITH THE SURROUNDING OLDER BUILDINGS. INTERNALLY THE PUBLIC DEPARTMENTS FORM A
STRIKING 4-STOREY VISTA OF GLASS AND STEEL. IT ALSO HOUSES AN ART GALLERY,
CAFE, LECTURE ROOM, DANCE/DRAMA PRACTICE ROOM, AND ADULT EDUCATION STUDY
DEPARTMENT. 'NOISY' ACTIVITIES, E.G. THE LOAN COUNTER AND CHILDREN'S
DEPARTMENT, ARE CONCENTRATED ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THE 1ST-FLOOR ADULT
DEPARTMENT HAS CAPACITY FOR 60,000 LENDING AND 10,000 REFERENCE VOLUMES. THE
2ND FLOOR HOUSES ADMINISTRATION AND CATALOGUE DEPARTMENTS, COUNTY LIBRARY, AND
STAFF ACCOMMODATION.
NESSEBY LIBRARY' A BIG EFFORT FOR A SMALL AUTHORITY.
     
NESSEBY, IN NORTHERN NORWAY, IS LARGE IN AREA (1,438 SQ.KIL.) BUT SMALL IN
POPULATION (1,120 INHABITANTS). AFTER MANY YEARS OF INADEQUATE LIBRARY
ACCOMMODATION, A NEW COMMUNITY CENTRE INCLUDING A LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN 1980,
SO WELCOME THAT THE INCREASED FINANCIAL BURDEN IS NOT RESENTED. THE LIBRARY IS
IN THE BASEMENT, BUT SLOPING GROUND ALLOWS AMPLE WINDOW SPACE. FOR THE 1ST
TIME THERE IS A LOAN COUNTER, A LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE, AND ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE
4,500 BOOKS. THE ADDITION OF A PROPOSED MOBILE LIBRARY WOULD ENSURE A GOOD
LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE AREA, THOUGH EXPANSION WILL BE NECESSARY IN TIME.
DOES TRONDHEIM NEED A PUBLIC LIBRARY? OPEN LETTER TO THE PARTY MEMBERS IN THE
TOWN COUNCIL.
     
THE STAFF OF TRONDHEIM PUBLIC LIBRARY, NORWAY, CONSIDER THE LATEST
POSTPONEMENT (TILL AFTER 1982) OF THE PLANNED NEW LIBRARY TOTALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE. HAVING LONG TOLERATED UNSATISFACTORY CONDITIONS IN THE
EXPECTATION OF IMPROVEMENT, THEY NOW DEMAND THAT THE PRESENT LIBRARY SHOULD BE
BROUGHT UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND WORK ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS,
THOUGH EVEN THIS WOULD NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. MUCH OF THE
BOOKSTOCK IS HOUSED ELSEWHERE FOR LACK OF SPACE, WHICH TOGETHER WITH STAFF
SHORTAGES MAKES FOR UNSATISFACTORY PUBLIC SERVICE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTEND
SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY, HANDICAPPED AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. ONLY A
NEW LIBRARY CAN BRING TRONDHEIM INTO LINE WITH OTHER NORWEGIAN CITY LIBRARY
SERVICES.
A CASTLE FULL OF BOOKS.
     
DESCRIBES HOLSTEBRO NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY, DENMARK OPENED IN AUG 81. HOLSTEBRO
HAS LED AN ACTIVE AND CONTROVERSIAL CULTURAL POLICY WITH PURCHASE OF
SCULPTURE, BUILDING OF MUSEUMS AND NOW THE LIBRARY, COSTING 40 MILLION KR. A
TOWN HALL IS PLANNED NEXT TO THE LIBRARY. THE BUILDING RESEMBLES A CASTLE AND
FITS IN WITH THE OTHER HOUSES IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE, ALL IN MOCK MEDIEVAL
STYLE. THE LIBRARY (6000 SQ. M.) CONSISTS OF A MAIN LENDING AREA SURROUNDED BY
A BALCONY CONTAINING THE READING ROOM, MUSIC LIBRARY AND OFFICES. A LARGE
MEETING HALL, CAREFULLY PLANNED WITH REGARD TO ACOUSTICS, IS THE CENTRE OF
FILM, MUSIC, THEATRICAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. THE AIM HAS BEEN TO MAKE THE
LIBRARY LIKE A SUPERMARKET WITH MANY OFFERS.
TEN YEARS' STRUGGLE GAVE A RESULT IN LORENSKOG: NEW PREMISES, GREAT INCREASE
IN LOANS-NOW ONLY STAFF ARE LACKING.
     
LORENSKOG CENTRAL LIBRARY, NORWAY, WAS ESTABLISHED IN SCHOOL PREMISES IN 1967
AS A COMBINED PUBLIC/SCHOOL LIBRARY. FROM THE 1ST IT WAS TOO SMALL AND THE
COMBINATION PROVED UNSATISFACTORY. IN 1971 A REORGANISATION PLAN FOR THE
LIBRARY SERVICE INCLUDED A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF
POSTPONEMENTS, WORSENING CONDITIONS AND STAFF PROTESTS, THE LIBRARY RENTED 650
SQ.M. IN A NEW OFFICE BLOCK-MORE THAN DOUBLE ITS EXISTING ACCOMMODATION,
THOUGH HALF THE SPACE PROPOSED IN 1971-AND OPENED THERE IN SUMMER 80. LOANS
HAVE RISEN BY 85%. LACK OF STAFF NECESSITATES A REDUCTION OF 9 HOURS PER WEEK
IN OPENING TIMES, AND PREVENTS ANY EXTENSION ACTIVITIES, BUT THE STAFF
INTENDED TO CONTINUE THEIR FIGHT FOR BETTER LIBRARY SERVICE.
NORWAY'S LARGEST BRANCH LIBRARY.
     
STOVNER BRANCH OF DEICHMAN LIBRARY, OSLO, WHICH REOPENED IN JAN 80, OCCUPIES
THE WHOLE GROUND FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING ADJOINING THE SHOPPING CENTRE,
HAVING OUTGROWN ITS ORIGINAL 1976 PREMISES. SERVING A POPULATION OF SOME
30,000 OF WHOM 10,000 ARE AGED UNDER 15, IT IS USED BY 62 NURSERY SCHOOLS, 9
PRIMARY SCHOOLS, 5 SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND A FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGE. IT IS
NORWAY'S LARGEST BRANCH LIBRARY, WITH A FLOOR AREA OF 1,042 SQ.M. AND A
BOOKSTOCK OF 35,000 VOLUMES. DISPLAYS ARE A SPECIAL FEATURE, AND A QUIET-STUDY
ROOM WITH 18 PLACES IS MUCH APPRECIATED.
NEW LIBRARY IN VAGAN AUTHORITY.
     
VAGAN, NORWAY, HAS 9,700 INHABITANTS, OF WHOM 4,000 LIVE IN SVOLVAER. SVOLVAER
LIBRARY HAS A BOOKSTOCK OF 39,000 VOLUMES' THERE ARE 5 BRANCHES. A NEW LIBRARY
WAS OPENED IN NOV 79, SHARING A BUILDING WITH DISTRICT MEDICAL AND DENTAL
SERVICES. THE LIBRARY OCCUPIES THE GROUND FLOOR, WHICH HOUSES LENDING
DEPARTMENTS, READING ROOMS, LOCAL COLLECTION AND EXHIBITION AREA, AND PART OF
THE BASEMENT, USED FOR STACKS, STUDY ROOMS, ROOMS FOR MEETINGS AND OTHER
ACTIVITIES, AND ACCOMMODATION FOR A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE.
RENOVATION OF A PROTECTED BUILDING IN SAYNATSALO.
     
SAYNATSALO MAIN LIBRARY FORMS A PART OF THE LOCAL TOWN HALL DESIGNED BY ALVAR
AALTO 30 YEARS AGO. THE BUILDING IS PROTECTED. THE RENOVATION HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE MUSEUM OFFICE. CONSEQUENTLY
COMPROMISES HAD TO BE MADE. SOME SOLUTIONS WERE EXPENSIVE. THE LIBRARY IS ON 2
FLOORS BUT NO LIFTS COULD BE INSTALLED. THE MUSEUM OFFICE STIPULATED THAT ALL
FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES MUST BE REPLACED BY AALTO FURNITURE, SOME OF WHICH
HAD TO BE SPECIALLY MADE FOR THE LIBRARY BUILDING.
SUCCESSFUL CONVERSION IN MOSS.
     
MOSS LIBRARY, NORWAY, WAS PURPOSE-BUILT IN 1927, BUT UNTIL 1980 OTHER LOCAL
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS OCCUPIED ALL BUT THE GROUND FLOOR. IN 1978 IT BECAME
POSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE WHOLE BUILDING FOR LIBRARY USE. THE LIBRARY NOW
OCCUPIES 1292 SQ.M. ON 3 FLOORS. THE BASEMENT HOUSES STACKS, A STUDY-ROOM AND
A STORY-HOUR ROOM. LENDING DEPARTMENTS OCCUPY THE GROUND FLOOR, AND READING
AND PERIODICALS ROOMS THE 1ST FLOOR. A TOWER WING HOUSES THE LIBRARIAN'S
OFFICE, LOCAL COLLECTION AND MICROFILM EQUIPMENT. WHILE EXTRA SPACE FOR
EXHIBITIONS, STUDY PLACES AND A MUSIC DEPARTMENT WOULD BE VALUABLE, THE
CONVERSION IS FELT TO BE A SUCCESS BY BOTH STAFF AND PUBLIC.
FJELL BRANCH, DRAMMEN' MINIMUM LIBRARY IN POPULOUS SUBURB.
     
VACATED POSTAL AND BANK PREMISES IN FJELL, NORWAY, WERE TAKEN OVER IN SEPT 80
AS A PROVISIONAL SOLUTION TO THE ACUTE NEED FOR LIBRARY FACILITIES IN A
TOWER-BLOCK SUBURB WITH 6,000 INHABITANTS. THOUGH ONLY 105 SQ.M. (40% OF THE
AREA NEEDED), THE PREMISES WERE SUITABLE FOR LIBRARY USE WITH MINIMUM
ALTERATION, ACCOMMODATING 3,500 ADULT AND 2,500 JUNIOR BOOKS, AND READING
PLACES FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. WITH SUCH RESTRICTED SPACE, PRIORITY IS BEING
GIVEN TO SERVING THE LEAST MOBILE SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, OLD PEOPLE,
CHILDREN AND HOUSEWIVES.
MICROFORM ROOM ENVIRONMENTS' THE EXTERNAL FACTORS.
     
GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF MICROFORMS WITH THE LIBRARY PUBLIC IS ENCOURAGED WHEN
PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT. IN PLANNING LIBRARY
SERVICES IN MICROFORMS, SPECIAL EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE PHYSICAL
SETUP AND THE USER'S NEEDS WITHIN THE DESIGNATED READING AREAS. CONCENTRATES
ON GUIDELINES FOR LIGHTING, TEMPERATURE AND AIR QUALITY, AESTHETICS, NOISE AND
SPACE STRATEGIES. OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE ABOUT THE USER'S COMFORT AND HIS/HER
EXPECTATIONS IN USING THE FORMAT, INCLUDING EASE IN HANDLING AND READING FILM
MATERIALS AND SIMULATION OF BOOK READING HABITS. FINALLY THE MERITS OF
CENTRALISED AND DECENTRALISED MICROFORM READING AREAS ARE DISCUSSED.
NATIONAL BOOK WEEK REPORT.
     
HOHOLA PUBLIC LIBRARY, PORT MORESBY, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, ORGANISED MANY
ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN DURING NATIONAL BOOK WEEK, AUG 81, INCLUDING STORY
SESSIONS AND FILM SHOWS. THE CHILDREN'S RESPONSE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AND IT IS
HOPED THAT SUCH EVENTS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET TO KNOW AND USE LIBRARIES.

LIBRARIES PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED. PARTICULAR STRESS IS LAID UPON THE
NECESSITY OF COOPERATING WITH A DESIGN CONSULTANT AND THE USE OF COLOUR AND
SYMBOL SIGNS. A SIGNAGE SYSTEM IS SUGGESTED WHICH IS GRADED IN PROPORTION TO
THE READER'S CAPACITY OF RECEIVING AND DIGESTING ANY GIVEN INFORMATION.
LIBRARIES' ROLE IN INFORMATION ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
WHILE ALL THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO AID FOR DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES DEVOTED TO INFORMATION SERVICES ARE
COMPARATIVELY SMALL. THE 14TH SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARY CONFERENCE IS URGED TO TAKE
UP THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN INFORMATION FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH IS NOT
MERELY A QUESTION OF STATISTICAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DOCUMENTATION, BUT COVERS
ALL FORMS OF LITERARY AND ARTISTIC EXPRESSION. SOME SWEDISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES
HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED FACILITIES FOR DISCUSSING CURRENT TOPICS IN THE FIELD,
IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL STUDY GROUPS AND SIDA, THE SWEDISH ORGANISATION FOR
INTERNATIONAL AID. A SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS WAS HELD IN SUMMER 77 ON KENYA AND
TANZANIA, AND A UNESCO SEMINAR IS PRODUCING A HANDBOOK OF PRACTICAL HINTS FOR
LIBRARIANS ON INFORMATION REGARDING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. A PILOT PROJECT ON
BORAS HAS BEEN GRANTED FINANCE TO STOCK A SPECIAL 'CORNER' OF DEVELOPING
COUNTRY INFORMATION, AND HOPES T O MAN IT CONTINUOUSLY FOR ENQUIRERS.

A REVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE UNDERDEVELOPED INFORMATION BROKING BUSINESS IN WEST
GERMANY. THE SITUATION IS CHARACTERISED BY A LACK OF PRIVATE INITIATIVES AND
AN ARRAY OF PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES WHICH ARE USEFUL BUT INSUFFICIENT TO MEET
THE NEED OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
BROKING AGENCIES SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED.
TH CONFERENCE OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE STATE LIBRARIES OF THE UNION REPUBLICS.R
     
EPORTS ON PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH ALL-UNION CONFERENCE OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE
STATE LIBRARIES OF THE UNION REPUBLICS WHO MET TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF
LIBRARIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE'S

ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL
AGRICULTURE.
CONCEPTS OF REFERENCE SERVICE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
TO ASCERTAIN THE ATTITUDES OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
TOWARDS REFERENCE SERVICE, AN ENQUIRY BASED ON PERSONAL INTERVIEWS AND
QUESTIONNAIRES WAS CARRIED OUT DURING PART OF 1979 AND 80. THE SURVEY
POPULATION WAS SELECTED FROM THE 3 MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND 3 OF THE
LARGER COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION LIBRARIES. INTERVIEWS WERE DESIGNED TO
PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT ATTITUDES TO REFERENCE PROVISION, AND QUESTIONNAIRES
SOUGHT TO MEASURE RESPONDENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS SPECIFIC REFERENCE SERVICES
AS EXPRESSED BY THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF AN OPINION OF SUCH A SERVICE.
FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND ON THE JOB TRAINING MAY BE
BOTH HAPHAZARD AND INEFFECTUAL. IT APPEARS THAT A REASSESSMENT OF THE WHOLE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING MIGHT BE IN ORDER.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN SOCIAL SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION (COVERING IN THE
WIDEST SENSE ALL ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION) IS ESSENTIAL, YET THE VERY NATURE OF THE INFORMATION
CREATES OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION. MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF ESTABLISHING
COOPERATION HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED AND CONSTANT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT ALL
LEVELS. ONE OF THE 1ST TASKS FACING THESE CONTEMPLATING COOPERATION IS TO
IMPROVE RECIPROCAL INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE SUBJECTS FOR COOPERATION AND ON THE
MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. THEY SHOULD THEN EXCHANGE MATERIALS, INFORMATION,
IDEAS, AND PROJECTS. IF FURTHER COOPERATION IS PROPOSED, JOINT OBJECTIVES
COULD BE ACHIEVED, NETWORKS ESTABLISHED, AND MOVES TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDISATION INITIATED.

A STUDY OF INFORMATION CHANNELS IN TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION' THEIR ROLE IN
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.
     
SUMMARY OF A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION PRESENTED FOR A HIGHER DEGREE IN
INFORMATION SCIENCE, BASED CHIEFLY ON RECENT LITERATURE, BRAZILIAN AND
FOREIGN. THE STUDY COVERS THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION IN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY; USER CHARACTERISTICS; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION AND INFORMATION CHANNELS; AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INFORMATION
CHANNELS. THIS ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES, INFORMAL CHANNELS OF TECHNICAL
COMMUNICATION ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROPOSES WAYS IN WHICH RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT MANAGERS CAN MAXIMISE USE OF HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH MANIPULATION
OF THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, THROUGH INVESTIGATION
OF THE EXISTING COMMUNICATION/INFORMATION ROLES AS INFORMATION PROCESSING
SYSTEMS. THESE ROLES CONSTITUTE THE TRUE AGENTS OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ,
BOTH WITHIN THE ORGANISATION AND BETWEEN SEPARATE ORGANISATIONS. PARTICULAR
REFERENCE IS MADE TO RECENT BRAZILIAN RESEARCH.

MATCHING USER NEEDS IN HEALTH CARE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS
AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, 22-25 SEPT 81. OUTLINES THE PATTERN OF
LIBRARY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO STAFF IN THE UK NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (N.H.S.)
AND GIVES A PRELIMINARY REPORT OF A STUDY OF LIBRARY USAGE AND OF ATTITUDES
TOWARD LIBRARIES AMONG CLINICAL AND PRE-CLINICAL STAFF AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES SERVING N.H.S. STAFF ARE NUMEROUS BUT SMALL, MOST COMMONLY BEING
STAFFED BY A SINGLE LIBRARIAN, AND RECEIVE LITTLE PUBLICITY. IN SPITE OF THEIR
SMALL SIZE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HAVE A 'SPECIAL LIBRARY' CHARACTER. TEACHING
HOSPITAL LIBRARIES REPRESENT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE
N.H.S. LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND ARE THE LARGEST OF THE LIBRARIES SERVING N.H.S.
STAFF. DATA ON USAGE AND ATTITUDES WERE COLLECTED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS
IN THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS WOULD GIVE A RICHER PICTURE THAN WOULD BE
PROVIDED BY ANY ONE OF CONVENTIONAL SURVEY TECHNIQ UES. DISCUSSES THE USE OF
MODELLING METHODS FOR INTERPRETING DATA.
AVAILABILITY OF VETERINARY INFORMATION IN THE VETERINARY LIBRARIES, MEMBERS OF
THE VETERINARY MEDICAL SECTION/MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION FOR LATIN AMERICA.
     
THE VETERINARY LIBRARIES, MEMBERS OF THE VMS/MLA, HAVE
INFORMATION/DOCUMENTATION SERVICES ORIENTED TOWARDS THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD. IN
SOUTH AMERICA, IT SEEMS THAT THIS INFORMATION IS ORIENTED TOWARD ANIMAL
INDUSTRY AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE NEEDS OF VETERINARY
USERS OR THE VETERINARY COLLECTIONS IN SOUTH AMERICAN LIBRARIES. THE
INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE VMS/MLA IS FROM THE WORK AND ACTIVITIES OF ITS
COMMITTEES. IN EACH INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY, ACCESS TO THE IMPORTANT DATA BASES,
E.G. CAB, BIOSIS, MEDLINE AND AGRICOLA, IS AVAILABLE. ACCESS TO THE CATALOGUE
OF EACH VETERINARY LIBRARY IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON MICROFILM OR IN A PRINTED
FORM.

ACTIVITY REPORT.
THE AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT AND AFTERWARDS' A SUMMARY.
     
THE WORK OF THE AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION REVIEW COMMITTEE, SUPPORTED BY THE
BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, IS DESCRIBED. THE
FINDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT (BLRD REPORT 5469) IS OUTLINED. A SERIES OF
ONE-DAY SEMINARS HELD TO MAKE THE CONTENTS OF THE REPORT BETTER KNOWN TO
INFLUENTIAL INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, AND TO
OBTAIN THEIR VIEWS ON THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT ITSELF IS DESCRIBED. A FINAL
MEETING WAS HELD TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE PRIORITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED. THESE
WERE: THE 'GREY' (NON-CONVENTIONAL) LITERATURE; REVIEW LITERATURE; DIRECTORY
OF INFORMATION SOURCES; TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN INFORMATION HANDLING; USER
NEEDS; CO-ORDINATION OF INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.
GENERAL PUBLIC INFORMATION ON AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH.
     
REPORT EXPLAINS THE NEED FOR SUPPLEMENTING EXISTING INFORMATION ON
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH WITH NEWLY COORDINATED INFORMATION AND SUGGESTS AN
EXPANDED AND BETTER EQUIPPED INFORMATIONAL ORGANISATION.
ROLE OF AN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IN
AGRICULTURE.
     
INDIAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES HAVE MADE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION IN THE FIELDS
OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AND HAVE JUSTIFIED THE INVESTMENT OF
PUBLIC FUNDS ON THEM AS THEY HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF FOOD AND HUNGER TO A
CONSIDERABLE EXTENT BY UNDERTAKING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMMES AND ADOPTING
MODERN TECHNOLOGY FOR INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN
THEIR PACE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CENTRAL AND
STATE SUPPORT FOR SOUND DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
HOW AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES CAN HELP FIGHT A WORLDWIDE THREAT.
     
WEEDS POSE A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO MAXIMISATION OF CROP YIELDS WORLDWIDE AND
DIFFERENT PROGRAMMES FOR THEIR CONTROL ARE OUTLINED. PROFESSIONAL AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARIANS CAN ASSIST WEED SCIENTISTS THROUGH APPRECIATING THE EXTENT AND
SERIOUSNESS OF THE THREAT AND TAKING SEVERAL STEPS TO PROVIDE AND ORGANISE
LITERATURE THAT BEARS ON THE PROBLEM.
USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE IN CEREALS RESEARCH.
     
THE USE AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE ON CEREALS RESEARCH IN
NIGERIA WAS DETERMINED BY USING A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH. ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND
INDIGENOUS AFRICAN LANGUAGE LITERATURE WAS EXCLUDED. LANGUAGES INCLUDED WERE
FRENCH, GERMAN, SPANISH, RUSSIAN, JAPANESE AND CHINESE. METHODS USED IN THE
SURVEY WERE A TWO-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE LOANS RECORDS OF THE NATIONAL CEREALS
RESEARCH INSTITUTE LIBRARY, QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED TO RESEARCH SCIENTISTS
AND ANALYSES OF THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE REFERENCES IN RECENT PUBLICATIONS AND
THESES OF THE SCIENTISTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SCIENTISTS MAKE LITTLE USE OF
FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE BECAUSE FEW OF THEM ARE ABLE TO READ THESE
LANGUAGES. CONSEQUENTLY SCIENTISTS ARE MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND THERE
IS DUPLICATION OF RESEARCH WHICH USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE COULD
MINIMISE. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINESE AND JAPANESE ARE
IMPORTANT IN CEREALS RESEARCH.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM' SYSTEMS DESIGN.
     
DESCRIBES THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH SERVICES (DYS) OF
MASSACHUSETTS ASSESSED ITS INFORMATION NEEDS AND CURRENTLY USED THE DATA
SYSTEM AND DESIGNED A PROPOSED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS). THE GOALS
OF DYS IN DEVELOPING THE NEW SYSTEM WERE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DATA
AVAILABLE BY ADDING NEW DATA OR BY AGGREGATING EXISTING DATA IN NEW WAYS; TO
IMPROVE DATA CURRENTLY PRODUCED BY ENHANCING RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS,
USEFULNESS, AND AVAILABILITY; AND TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY OF DATA PRODUCTION BY
STREAMLINING DATA GATHERING, PROCESSING, AND REPORTING FOR BOTH MANUAL AND
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS.
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SWISS WATCH INDUSTRY IN THE FIELDS OF PATENT INFORMATION
AND DOCUMENTATION.
     
RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE HAS CAUSED AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR PATENT
INFORMATION IN THE SWISS WATCH INDUSTRY. THIS IS CATERED FOR BY THE SWISS
DOCUMENTATION CENTRE IN THE FIELD OF MICROTECHNOLOGY, BETTER KNOWN AS
CENTREDOC. CENTREDOC MAINTAINS A LIBRARY WITH ON-LINE SEARCH FACILITIES AND

DESIGNING OF A FUTURE SWEDISH POLICY IN INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
APPLICATION OF INFORMATION THEORY TO THE DESIGN OF LINE-SCAN IMAGING SYSTEMS.
     
INFORMATION THEORY IS USED TO FORMULATE A SINGLE FIGURE OF MERIT FOR ASSESSING
THE PERFORMANCE OF LINE SCAN IMAGING SYSTEMS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR SPATIAL
RESPONSE (POINT SPREAD FUNCTION OR MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTION), SENSITIVITY,
SAMPLING AND QUANTIZATION INTERVALS, AND THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF A
RANDOM RADIANCE FIELD.
RESEARCH IN SOURCE-CHANNEL CODING AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS.
     
AN EXTENSION OF SHANNON'S INFORMATION THEORY AND AN ANALYSIS OF DYNAMIC
MULTIPLE-ACCESS DISCIPLINES FOR COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND NETWORKS WERE
STUDIED WITH AN EMPHASIS ON APPLICATIONS TO SATELLITE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
AND COMPUTER COMMUNICATION NETWORKS.
EURO-AMERICAN CONFLICTS IN THE SPHERE OF TRANSBORDER DATA FLOW (TDF).
     
THE CONFLICTS AND POSSIBILITIES FOR THEIR SOLUTION WITHIN THE AREA OF
TRANSBORDER DATA FLOW BETWEEN THE USA AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ARE
STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE WITHIN THE AREA OF MASS-MEDIA BETWEEN THE
INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES AND THE THIRD WORLD. THE AUTHOR CALLS FOR REDEFINITION OF
THE EUROPEAN INTERESTS AND COMMENCEMENT OF POLITICAL AUTONOMY, AS WELL AS A
CERTAIN AND CLEARLY DEFINED DISSOCIATION OF EUROPE FROM THE USA, COMPARABLE TO
THE OBJECTIVELY DIFFERENT INTERESTS OF EUROPE IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND
ENERGY POLITICS. THE DISSOCIATION FROM THE USA IS PROPOSED LAST BUT NOT LEAST
IN ORDER THAT EUROPE REMAINS CREDIBLE VIS-A-VIS THE THIRD WORLD IN THE
MASS-MEDIA DEBATE.

TO CHARGE OR NOT TO CHARGE-WHO PAYS FOR THE INFORMATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE, INFORMATION '81'
FORECASTS AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. THE TRUE COST
OF OBTAINING AND PRODUCING INFORMATION IS FREQUENTLY HIDDEN OR DISTORTED
THROUGH THE EXISTENCE OF A SYSTEM IN WHICH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS DO NOT
ALWAYS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND MAY EVEN BE IN OPEN COMPETITION. LOOKS AT THE
AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON INFORMATION AROUND THE WORLD AND DISCUSSES THE VALUE
OF INFORMATION. TO CHARGE FOR INFORMATION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IS UNAVOIDABLE.
URGES A REDUCED INVOLVEMENT OF THE UK GOVERNMENT IN INFORMATION ACTIVITIES
PERIPHERAL TO SUPPORTING THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND ARGUES THAT WITH
THE STIMULATION OF INNOVATION THROUGH COMPETITIVE MARKET FORCES, THE QUALITY
AND RELEVANCE OF INFORMATION PRODUCTS WOULD GREATLY INCREASE.
NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-SOCIAL ASPECTS, USAGE AND TRENDS.
     
FOLLOWING A DEFINITION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND A
BRIEF MENTION OF SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS TO WHICH IT CAN BE PUT, ADVANTAGES
AND DISADVANTAGES OF NEW IT SYSTEMS ARE REVIEWED. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR MASS
UTILISATION OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE DISCUSSED AND THE NECESSITY FOR
EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN ITS USE IS STRESSED. AN OVERVIEW OF VARIOUS VIDEOTEX
TRIALS IS GIVEN TOGETHER WITH REACTIONS OF USERS. FINALLY SOME TRENDS IN THE
USE AND APPLICATION OF IT ARE NOTED AND A CALL IS MADE FOR ADDITIONAL STUDIES
TO ASCERTAIN THE ACTUAL USE THE PUBLIC MAKES OF THE INFORMATION IT SEEKS.
COMPUTER-BASED NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS' TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY
ISSUES.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN OVERVIEW STUDY ON THE USE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN
NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND RELATED PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES. THE PURPOSES OF
THIS STUDY ARE' (1) TO PROVIDE A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER-BASED
NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, (2) TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING
COMPUTER AND INFORMATION POLICY ISSUES, (3) TO PROVIDE A STATE-OF-THE-ART
SURVEY OF COMPUTER AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND INDUSTRIES, AND (4) TO PROVIDE
A FOUNDATION FOR OTHER RELATED STUDIES.
CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO AUTOMATIC
PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA.
     
THE CONVENTION COVERS GENERAL PROVISIONS; BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR DATA
PROTECTION; TRANSBORDER DATA FLOWS; MUTUAL ASSISTANCE.
TECHNOLOGY AND THE INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL: WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?.
     
EXAMINES THE LIKELY IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION
SCIENTISTS, AND ON DATA BASE PRODUCERS, OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. DATA BASE
PRODUCERS WILL INCREASINGLY RELY ON HOME-BASED ABSTRACTORS WHO RECEIVE, CREATE
AND SEND ALL THEIR MATERIAL BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH
PROCEDURES FOR THE DATA BASE PRODUCERS ARE OUTLINED. INCREASING USE OF
VIDEODISCS FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL IS ENVISAGED. THE IMPACT OF
NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IS THEN EXAMINED. USE
OF VIDEODISCS WILL MEAN A DECLINE IN THE USE OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
USE OF INTELLIGENT TERMINALS WILL LEAD TO GREATER USE OF THESE SYSTEMS BY
END-USERS. THE INTELLIGENT TERMINALS COULD BE USED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE
LANGUAGES, TO REFINE SEARCH STRATEGIES, TO STORE AND EDIT OUTPUT FROM SEARCHES
AND TO ADVISE USERS ON THE BEST DATA BASES AND BEST SEARCH STRATEGY TO USE.
ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THOSE LEADING TO THE 'OFFICE OF
THE FUTURE'. CONCLUDES THAT THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC SHAKEOUT IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, BUT THAT INFORMATION SCIENTISTS FACE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO
DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS BY THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT SCHOOLS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE TEACH THEIR STUDENTS TYPING
SKILLS. FINALLY, SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE ADVISABILITY OF OFFERING SOPHISTICATED
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS TO LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE MADE.
INTERNATIONAL MUSEUM DATA STANDARDS AND EXPERIMENTS IN DATA TRANSFER.
     
INVESTIGATES THE DATA STANDARDS ADOPTED BY A NUMBER OF MAJOR MUSEUM
DOCUMENTATION SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD AND ATTEMPTS TO UNIFY THESE STANDARDS
INTO A SINGLE LISTING OF DATA CATEGORIES. ATTEMPTS TO APPLY THE UNIFIED DATA
STANDARD DURING COMPUTER PROCESSING OF MUSEUM RECORDS FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.
FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION TO ALL!.
     
GUIDELINES ON COMPUTERISATION POLICY FOR THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF
MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS. DATA AND TELECOMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY OPENS NEW
POSSIBILITIES IN DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES MUST TAKE
PART. THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE ACCESS TO INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE AND CULTURE MUST
BE UPHELD. STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INFORMATION DATA-BASES MUST BE
ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. LIBRARY RESOURCES MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE, AND
ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES GOVERNED BY ONE DIRECTORATE. THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY
MUST BE THE STARTING-POINT FOR ANY SYSTEM OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DATA-BASES. THE
ANONYMITY OF THE BORROWER SHOULD BE SAFEGUARDED. TRADE UNIONS SAY THAT ANY
LOSS OF JOBS THROUGH COMPUTERISATION MUST BE BALANCED BY NEW JOBS IN OTHER
AREAS, PREFERABLY RELEASING STAFF FOR IMPROVED READER SERVICE. EXISTING
DOCUMENTS ON THE INFLUENCE OF AUTOMATION MUST BE IMPLEMENTED. THERE MUST BE A
SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE RELATIONS IN  PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
AND WORKING CONDITIONS MUST NOT DETERIORATE. COMPUTERS MUST NOT BE USED TO
OVERSEE EMPLOYEES' WORK EFFICIENCY. STAFF MUST RECEIVE FULL INSTRUCTION ON THE
TECHNOLOGY AND FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.

INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL STRATEGY.
     
THE STRATEGY OF AN APPROACH TO REPRESENTING AND SEARCHING THE GENERIC CHEMICAL
FORMULAS (MARKUSH FORMULAS) TYPICAL OF CHEMICAL PATENTS IS OUTLINED. THE
METHODS UNDER DEVELOPMENT INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING STAGES' (1) THE DESCRIPTION OF
GENERIC CHEMICAL EXPRESSIONS BY MEANS OF A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL; AN
APPROACH TO THE GENERATION AND RECOGNITION OF SUBSTITUENTS OR RADICALS DEFINED
BY GENERIC NOMENCLATURAL EXPRESSIONS, VIA FORMAL GRAMMARS; (3) METHODS FOR
AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF SCREEN CHARACTERISTICS, INDIVIDUALLY AND WITHIN THE
RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL FRAMEWORKS DEFINED BY GENERIC FORMULAS; (4) SEARCH
TECHNIQUES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC STRUCTURES AND SUBSTRUCTURES WITHIN
GENERIC FORMULAS BASED ON THESE METHODS.
COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 2.
GENSAL, A FORMAL LANGUAGE FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL, IS DESCRIBED WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR THE CONCISE AND
UNAMBIGUOUS REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC STRUCTURES FROM CHEMICAL PATENTS
('MARKUSH FORMULAS') IN A MANNER WHICH IS INTELLIGIBLE TO A CHEMIST, YET
SUFFICIENTLY FORMALISED FOR AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS BY A COMPUTER. GENSAL CONTAINS
A NUMBER OF FACILITIES FOR SHOWING THE ALTERNATIVES POSSIBLE IN A GENERIC
STRUCTURE AND ANY SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEIR VARIETY. EXPERIENCE TO
DATE SUGGESTS THAT GENSAL IS CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH MOST OF THE TYPES OF
GENERIC STATEMENT ENCOUNTERED IN PATENTS.
COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 3.
CHEMICAL GRAMMARS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A SIMPLE TOPOLOGICAL CHEMICAL GRAMMAR IS DEVELOPED, AND ITS POSSIBLE
APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPUTER MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES ARE
DISCUSSED. THE GENERATIVE AND RECOGNITIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE GRAMMAR ARE
ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES. CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING THE ROLE OF SUCH
CAPABILITIES IN A GENERIC (MARKUSH) STRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM.

THE ELECTRONIC FUTURE-IMPACT ON WORK AND SOCIETY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS
AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. A PHILOSOPHICAL
DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION ON WORK AND
SOCIETY. SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNICATIVE SOCIETY TENDS TO DEMOCRATISE BECAUSE OF
THE ENORMOUS EXPANSION IN THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AND A SHIFT IN THE LABOUR FORCE SO THAT INFORMATION OPERATIVES BECOME
DOMINANT. STRESSES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT INPUT INTO MODERN PRODUCTIVE
SYSTEMS IS KNOWLEDGE. PREDICTS THAT BY THE 1990S THE WORLD WILL MOVE INTO AN
ERA OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY.
THE INHOUSE SOLUTION FOR DOCUMENT PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL BY AXP.
     
WITH IDOR-INHOUSE DOCUMENT ONLINE RETRIEVALSYSTEM-A SELF-SUPPORTING AND
COMPLETE TECHNOLOGY OF DOCUMENT PROCESSING, IS INTRODUCED. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY
OFFERS THE USUAL CONVENIENCE OF MINICOMPUTERS WITH THE SPEED OF PROCESSING OF
MAINFRAMES. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SPECIAL
FIRMWARE-PRODUCT, THE AXP-ASSOCIATE CROSSPOINT PROCESSOR. AXP COMPARES THE
CONTENTS OF THE DATA BANK AT TRANSFER-RATES UP TO 1.2 MEGABYTES PER SECOND
WITH 8,192 BYTES OF PARALLEL QUERY TERM MEMORY. THE NORMAL EFFORT OF THE
INPUT-PROCESSING IN THIS SYSTEM BRINGS WITH IT THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF
FURTHER PROCESSING SUCH AS RETRIEVAL, CORRECTION, UPDATING ETC.
THE QUALITY OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE. WHILE INFORMATION CONTROL
AND DOCUMENT ACCESS TECHNIQUES HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF
AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY, IT IS ON THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION INPUT THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS DEPENDS. INFORMATION PROCESSING SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO
THE PROCEDURES FOR SYSTEMS ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION, AND LINKED
DIRECTLY TO INFORMATION DISSEMINATION SERVICES. THE CHIEF FACTOR GOVERNING
QUALITY OF SYSTEM INPUT IS INFORMATION ANALYSIS, AND IN BRAZIL THIS IS ALMOST
TOTALLY NEGLECTED.
EXAMINATION OF THE MARKETING IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES.
     
INFORMATION NEEDS THE APPLICATION OF GOOD MARKETING PRINCIPLES IN ORDER TO
HAVE SATISFIED CUSTOMERS AND CREATE A FINANCIALLY SOUND INDUSTRY. INFORMATION
HAS HOWEVER SEVERAL MARKETING PROBLEMS' LACK OF SKILL WITHIN THE INDUSTRY;
ABSENCE OF MARKET RESEARCH; NO DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN SUPPLIER AND USER; POOR
PACKAGING; DIFFICULTIES OF MAINTAINING QUALITY; AND LITTLE APPRECIATION OF
VALUE BY THE CUSTOMER. PROMOTION ACTIVITY OF PERSONAL SELLING, MAILING,
ADVERTISING AND EXHIBITING HAS TO BE PLANNED AND MONITORED.

THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY CHEMICAL INFORMATION SPECIALIST PROGRAM' TRAINING THE
LIBRARY USER AND THE LIBRARIAN.
     
A PROGRAMME OF STUDY LEADING TO THE MASTER OF LIBRARY SCIENCE DEGREE WHICH
ALLOWS SPECIALISATION IN CHEMICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AT
INDIANA UNIVERSITY. PREREQUISITES AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS ARE PRESENTED, WITH
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE 3 CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT COURSES WHICH FORM THE CORE
OF THE PROGRAMME. THE ROLE OF THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT'S CHEMICAL INFORMATION
CENTER (CIC) IS DISCUSSED.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION FOR M.ED STUDENTS.
     
A SHORT COURSE ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC METHODS IN EDUCATION, INTEGRATED INTO A MED
DEGREE COURSE AT SHEFFIELD UNIVERSITY, IS DESCRIBED. THE 'BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RESEARCH' SECTION CURRICULUM IS OUTLINED, TOGETHER WITH THE PRACTICAL WORK
INVOLVED AND ASSESSMENT METHODS USED. STUDENT REACTIONS TO THE COURSE ARE
BRIEFLY CONSIDERED.
THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY AT NOVOSIBIRSK
INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.
     
DESCRIBES USER EDUCATION PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARY OF THE NOVOSIBIRSKII
ELEKTRONICHESKII INSTITUT (NOVOSIBIRSK INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING)
SINCE 1959. TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY THE
LIBRARY (OF OVER 1 MILLION VOLUMES) FOR THEIR 17,000 READERS, USERS ARE
DIVIDED INTO 10 GROUPS ACCORDING TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, PROFESSIONAL
INTERESTS AND RESULTING INFORMATION NEEDS. THE MAIN PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED IN THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM ARE LISTED. 5 GROUPS ARE CHOSEN AS EXAMPLES FOR A
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING THE PERIOD OF APPLICATION OF
THE USER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE LIBRARY.
USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS' WORKSHOP FOR A WEEK AT THE METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE
IN GOTHA.
     
THE METHODOLOGICAL CENTRE FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SERVICES IN GOTHA HELD A WORKSHOP FROM 16-20 JUNE 80 ON THE
PROBLEMS OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS. UNIVERSITY TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO
INSTRUCT STUDENTS IN METHODS AND TECHNIQUES NEEDED FOR USING LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. THIS INSTRUCTION SHOULD FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR
STUDIES TO ENABLE THEM TO MAKE FULL USE OF ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN THEIR
FIELD WHILE STUDYING AND TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS LATER ON. THE
WORKSHOP PROVIDED TEACHERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE IDEAS AND
EXPERIENCES ON THE SUBJECT, TALKS WERE GIVEN DEALING WITH SPECIFIC CASES OF
USER TRAINING AND 4 WORKGROUPS MET TO DISCUSS IDEAS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT.
TEACHERS SHOULD ATTEND FURTHER EDUCATION SEMINARS TO KEEP THEMSELVES UP TO
DATE WITH DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USER TRAINING AREA.
ESSEN WORKSHOP 1981' TRAINING READERS IN THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, 1-3
APRIL 1981.
     
LECTURES WERE GIVEN ON TRAINING READERS IN THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL AT
HOME AND ABROAD. FORMS OF TRAINING CAN BE VERY VARIED; THE CHOICE OF MEDIA
USED DEPENDS ON THE READER'S PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AND ON ECONOMIC
AND INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS. AT THE CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,
GOTEBORG, THE LIBRARY PROVIDES A BASIC INTRODUCTION FOR 1ST TIME USERS, A 14
HOUR COURSE ON LIBRARY SEARCH TECHNIQUES AND AN ADVANCED COURSE ON INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL. THE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE ON 'LEARNING BY DOING'. THE COLLECTION AND
INFORMATION CENTRE FOR AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA PLANNED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY WAS
DESCRIBED AND A DISCUSSION WAS HELD ON THE MERITS AND DEMERITS OF DIFFERENT
MEDIA. MORE COOPERATION IS REQUIRED BETWEEN MEDIA PRODUCERS AND LIBRARIANS.
ISBDS AND INTERCHANGE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN
RELATION TO UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE OUTLINING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
ISBDS AND THE UNISIST AND NATIS PROGRAMMES THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES OF IFLA, FID
AND CIA FROM 1961 ONWARDS. PROGRESS TO DATE IN IMPLEMENTING IN BRAZIL
DECISIONS MADE AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IS SURVEYED, WITH DETAILS OF THE
AUTOMATION PROGRAMME NOW UNDERWAY AND EXISTING INFORMATION NETWORKS. IN
CONCLUSION RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE ON SHAPING BRAZILIAN POLICIES TO MEET
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL.
MONOGRAPHS IN MICROFORM' ISSUES IN CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL.
     
DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS, MICROFORM ACQUISITIONS HAVE GROWN AT AN INCREDIBLE
RATE ALONG WITH WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION OF INADEQUATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO
THESE MATERIALS. LOCAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OVER MONOGRAPHS IN MICROFORM HAS
BEEN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM-RESEARCH LIBRARIES HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE
CATALOGUING FOR THESE MATEIALS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT AND PRIORITY
ACCORDED TO SIMILAR MATERIALS IN HARD COPY. IDENTIFIES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE
MICROFORM PROBLEM, REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES REGARDING
THE CATALOGUING OF MICROFORMS AND SUGGESTS THAT INTEGRATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC
ACCESS BE IMPLEMENTED AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS IN THE USA.
CLASSIFICATION OF READERS-USERS OF SPECIAL RECOMMENDED INDEXES.
     
DISCUSSES THE PROBLEM OF CLASSIFICATION OF READERS INTO GROUPS, ACCORDING TO
THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPILATION OF LISTS OF
RECOMMENDED READINGS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO SHOW THE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE APPLICATION OF CRITERIA WHOSE INTERACTION DEFINES A TYPE OF INFORMATION
NEED OF A GROUP. CRITERIA ARE BASED ON A SERIES OF INDICATORS ABLE TO EXPRESS
ESSENTIAL AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF READERS. CONCENTRATING ON FINE ARTS
BIBLIOGRAPHIES PRODUCES A MODEL OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF READERS INTO 4 BASIC,
EXPANDABLE GROUPS' STUDENTS OF TECHNICAL COLLEGES, SECONDARY VOCATIONAL
SCHOOLS AND WORKING YOUTH; STUDENTS AND INTELLIGENTSIA; NON-PROFESSIONAL
ARTISTS; AND READERS PROFESSIONALLY CONNECTED WITH THE PROMOTION OF THE FINE
ARTS.
AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION.
     
THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTING AN AUTOMATED ADAPTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BASED ON A SEMIOTIC MODEL ARE CONSIDERED. THIS MODEL
DERIVES FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THOSE UNDERLYING RELATIONAL LANGUAGES OF
FACET AND BLOCK CLASSIFICATIONS. THE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND DISTRIBUTION OF
DOCUMENTS, THE GENERAL TECHNOLOGICAL SCHEME OF THE SYSTEM, AND ALGORITHMS OF
ITS BASIC CIRCUIT ARE DESCRIBED. THE POSSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION OF A
SEMIOTIC MODEL TO SDI IS DEMONSTRATED.
CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1AS A SOURCE FOR NEWLY PUBLISHED BOOKS IN CHEMISTRY AND
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING.2
     
CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1AS A CONVENIENT SOURCE FOR INFORMATION ON NEWLY PUBLISHED
BOOKS IN CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING IS EXAMINED BY DISCUSSING HOW SUCH
INFORMATION CAN BE SEARCHED THROUGH CA INDEXES OR AN ON-LINE COMPUTER SEARCH
OF THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE DATA BASE. A SPECIALISED CURRENT-AWARENESS
BULLETIN IS ALSO DESCRIBED. OTHER TOPICS DISCUSSED INCLUDE COVERAGE AND
GENERAL GROWTH OF BOOK LITERATURE IN CA AND GROWTH OF BOOK LITERATURE IN
SELECTED SUBJECT AREAS IN PARTICULAR.
SIXTY YEARS OF 'PHOTOGRAPHIC ABSTRACTS'.
     
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE JOURNAL IN 1921 TO GIVE A MEANS OF SEARCHING THE
LITERATURE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS DISCUSSED, AND ITS
PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST 60 YEARS SURVEYED. THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEMS MET IS
REVIEWED, AND THE INFLUENCE OF LIMITED FUNDS UPON ITS PROGRESS EMPHASISED.
THE UTILIZATION OF AGRINDEX IN THE CARIBBEAN.
     
A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE INFORMATION HABITS AND NEEDS OF
THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHES IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES OF THE CARIBBEAN
REGION WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF AGRINDEX. THE SURVEY REVEALED
THAT AGRINDEX IS USED BY AND KNOWN TO ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS AND
POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS ARE DISCUSSED. FROM ALL INDICATIONS IT SEEMS THAT
THERE IS A NEED FOR AN INFORMATION SERVICE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ABSTRACTS AND
REVIEWS OF REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON RESEARCH
IN PROGRESS. TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE; ONE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A USER
EDUCATION PROGRAMME WHICH WOULD ENSURE WIDER USE OF AGRINDEX AND THE SECOND
FOR A SUB-REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION CENTRE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES.
INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICES: THE RESOURCE FILE.
     
AT THE PRESENT TIME THERE IS A SURGE OF INTEREST IN INFORMATION AND REFERRAL
(I&R) SERVICES. THIS MANUAL IS PART OF A SERIES OF PUBLICATIONS THAT IS
INTENDED TO RESPOND TO THAT INTEREST AND TO PROVIDE A SOLID BASE FOR A
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE PROMISES AND THE PROBLEMS OF I&R SERVICES. IT
HAS BEEN PREPARED TO FILL A CRITICAL NEED' TO PROVIDE DETAILED PROCEDURES OF A
METHOD FOR GATHERING, STORING, AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION ABOUT HUMAN
SERVICES.
THE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION AT TWENTY-FIVE.
     
THE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION (RTSD) OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION HAS HAD A PRODUCTIVE 25 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT HAS ENCOUNTERED
ORGANISATIONAL ISSUES AT BOTH ASSOCIATION AND DIVISION LEVELS, ITS AREAS OF
RESPONSIBILITY AND ITS STRUCTURE HAVE REMAINED THE SAME SINCE 1957. RTSD
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN ALL AREAS OF DIVISION RESPONSIBILITY. STANDARDS,
PUBLISHING AND CONTINUING EDUCATION HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY STRONG PROGRAMMES.
THE PROGNOSIS FOR THE DIVISION'S FUTURE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT IS STRENGTHENING
PROGRAMMES THAT SUPPORT ITS 1979 GOALS.
SERVICES FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
REGIONAL SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRES IN THE RHINELAND PALATINATE OFFER ADVICE AND
PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE TO GENERAL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS CONCERNING SPATIAL
PLANNING AND EQUIPMENT, LIBRARY PROCEDURES SUCH AS CATALOGUING, PURCHASING,
LOANS AND THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, AND ADMINISTRATION. THE CENTRES CAN
PROVIDE CRITICAL BOOK REVIEWS AND OPINIONS ON THE RANGE AND COSTS OF BOOKS.
THEY CAN ARRANGE BLOCK LOANS OF BOOKS TO SCHOOLS FROM THEIR OWN STOCKS AND
SUPPLY REQUESTED INDIVIDUAL TITLES THROUGH INTER-LIBRARY LOAN. THEY PREPARE
BASIC STOCK LISTS, DISSEMINATE INFORMATION AND ORGANISE CONFERENCES. THE
CENTRES NEED MORE STAFF IF THEY ARE TO KEEP PACE WITH DEMANDS BY SCHOOL
LIBRARIES FOR MORE CENTRALISED SERVICES.
HEADACHES, INFILTRATIONS AND FLICKERING BEFORE THE EYES.
     
DISCUSSES AUTOMATION IN ROSKILDE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (ROSKILDE
UNIVERSITETSBIBLIOTEK (RUB)). INTRODUCTION OF THE SAMKAT-PROJECT, A JOINT,
COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES, OPENS THE POSSIBILITY
OF COORDINATING ACCESSIONS AND CATALOGUING, BUT PROBLEMS WITH JOB DISTRIBUTION
WILL BE INEVITABLE AND SHOULD BE FACED. THE STANDARDS SPECIFICATION GROUP IN
ITS PRELIMINARY REPORTS ON ACCESSION SYSTEMS HAVE SKETCHED A SYSTEM VERY LIKE
THE ONE USED AT RUB. WHEN THE LIBRARY WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1971 IT ADOPTED THE
COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM OF DENMARK'S TECHNICAL LIBRARY. THIS WAS
DEVELOPED INTO AN ISSUE AND ACCESSION SYSTEM, BUT NOT WITHOUT TEETHING
TROUBLES. IT HAS NEVERTHELESS BROUGHT ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS TRANSFER OF WORK
FROM ROUTINE PROCESSES TO SERVICES. THE SYSTEM'S OUTPUT INCLUDES' ORDER FORMS
IN FICHE OF BOOKS ON ORDER, BUDGET CONTROL WHICH GIVES ACCOUNTS BY SUBJECT,
REMINDER LISTS OF BOOKS NOT YET DELIVERED BY THE  BOOKSELLER, LISTS OF NEW
ACQUISITIONS. AS PRINTING IS EXCLUDED ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS, PROBLEMS ARISE WITH
THE CONSTANT, TIRING USE OF MICROFICHE.

THE TOTAL LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOTAL LIBRARY SYSTEM BY PATRICK BARKEY AT THE
HUNNOLD LIBRARY, CLAREMONT COLLEGE, CALIFORNIA. THE EXTENSIVE ON-LINE SYSTEM
ENABLES INFORMATION TO BE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM THE OHIO COLLEGE LIBRARY
CENTER (OCLC) TERMINAL TO THE COMPUTER FOR ACQUISITIONS, BOOK-KEEPING,
CIRCULATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHES, WITH VERY LITTLE MANUAL INTERVENTION,
THUS CUTTING DOWN ON STAFF NUMBERS. 4 LOCAL CHARACTER CODES ARE ADDED TO OCLC
RECORDS, IDENTIFYING THE READER, REQUESTER, THE FUND AGAINST WHICH THE
PURCHASE IS TO BE CHARGED, AND ANY SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS. DESCRIBES THE USE OF
BAR CODES IN THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM, UPDATING THE CATALOGUE AND ACQUISITIONS
PROCEDURE FOR BOOKS. SAVINGS ARE NOW BEING SPENT ON NEW BOOKS.
ROUND TABLE OF NATIONAL CENTRES FOR LIBRARY SERVICES. WORKING GROUP. DATA BASE.
     
REPORT OF A CONFERENCE HELD BY THE ROTNAC WORKING GROUP, DATA BASE IN
COPENHAGEN, 18-20 NOV 80. THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE PRESENTED. 'THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK SYSTEM', BY RICHARD
COWARD; 'NATIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES, THE USE OF MARC TAPES', BY KAREN LUNDE
CHRISTENSEN; 'PROBLEMS OF COORDINATING DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION CODES IN ONE
DATABASE', BY ROB KOOYMAN; 'AUTHORITY CONTROL IN AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SYSTEMS', BY EIGIL BALLING; 'ONE DATA BASE AND A VARIETY OF OUTPUT', BY OLE
HOVMAN; 'COST-BENEFIT. A SWEDISH APPROACH TO EVALUATION', BY SVANTE HALLGREN.
SERIALS CONTROL.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS AND
REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. SERIALS CONTROL IS THROUGHT
TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF LIBRARY HOUSEKEEPING PROCESSES TO AUTOMATE. NO
AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM HAS YET BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE
COST-EFFECTIVE. MINICOMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS SHOW PROMISE OF MORE EFFICIENT
OPERATION. STUDIES AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY HAVE SHOWN THE FEASIBILITY OF
AUTOMATED SERIALS CHECK-IN BEING ACHIEVED FASTER THAN IS POSSIBLE MANUALLY.
FURTHER STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE
SYSTEM TO BE COST-EFFECTIVE. PREDICTION OF THE ARRIVAL DATE FOR IRREGULAR
SERIALS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. THE DIFFICULTIES (AND EXPENSE) OF UPDATING FILES
IN REAL-TIME REPRESENTS ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR WHICH A TENTATIVE SOLUTION IS
PROPOSED. THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE USER INTERFACE IS EMPHASISED AND THIS IS ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MATTERS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
PUBLIC LIBRARY BOOKSTOCKS: NEW STANDARDS OR NO STANDARDS?.
     
CONSIDERS THE VARIABLE FACTORS AFFECTING STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AND
DISCUSSES THE ATTEMPTS MADE BY THE BOURDILLON REPORT IN 1962, AND THE LATEST
IFLA STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, TO FORMULATE STANDARDS FOR BOOKSTOCK.
ARGUES THAT, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A GOOD STANDARD OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN
THE UK, THERE SHOULD BE A NEW AND HIGH LEVEL ENQUIRY INTO HOW MUCH OF THE
GREATLY INCREASED OUTPUT OF BRITISH PUBLISHING SHOULD BE PURCHASED TODAY.
POINTS OUT THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE KNOWN IS WHETHER PUBLIC LIBRARY BOOKFUNDS ARE
NOW CUT TO THE POINT WHERE THE QUANTITY OF NEW BOOKS BEING ADDED IS NOT
MATCHING THOSE WITHDRAWN THROUGH WEAR AND TEAR, AND THAT IDEALLY THERE SHOULD
BE AN EXCESS OF ADDITIONS.
CONTINUATIONS' SOME FUNDAMENTAL ACQUISITION CONCEPTS AND PROCEDURES.
     
CONTINUATIONS ARE NON-PERIODICAL PUBLICATIONS THAT ARE ISSUED IN SUCCESSIVE
PARTS AT REGULAR OR IRREGULAR INTERVALS. COMPLETENESS AND CURRENCY CONSTITUTE
REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTAINING THE CONTINUATIONS COLLECTIONS OF A
WELL-FUNCTIONING LIBRARY. THE SYSTEM INCORPORATED FOR ACQUISITIONS AND
HANDLING SHOULD BE SIMPLE, EASY TO USE, AND EASY TO SUPERVISE. CONCEPTS AND
GUIDELINES BASIC TO THE FORMULATION OF AN ACQUISITIONS POLICY FOR
CONTINUATIONS ARE HEREWITH EXPLAINED.
BRAZILIAN OFFICIAL SERIAL PUBLICATIONS' AN ACQUISITION STRATEGY.
     
REVIEWS PROBLEMS IN THE ACQUISITION OF OFFICIAL BRAZILIAN PUBLICATIONS AND
SUMMARISES VARIOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS AVAILABLE AS RESOURCES AND RECENT
ADVANCES IN INTERNAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. A COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
UNDERTAKEN BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LIBRARY IS DESCRIBED, INCLUDING
METHODS OF SELECTING TARGET AGENCIES AND THE RESPONSE RATE, AND ACQUISITIONS
RESULTING FROM REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS'
AVAILABILITY. RESULTS INDICATE A PREPONDERANCE OF SERIALS AMONG BRAZILIAN
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH A PROJECT FOR OTHER
LIBRARIES, AND PARTICULARLY FOR SERIALS ACQUISITION AND COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT, ARE NOTED.
DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR BOOKS' ONLINE BOOK ACQUISITION IN THE NEXT
DECADES.
     
THE CONCEPT OF LIBRARY DOCUMENT DELIVERY IS APPLIED TO BOOK PURCHASE. TRENDS
IN AUTOMATION IN THE BOOK TRADE AND LIBRARIES IN THE USA AND UK ARE SUMMARISED
TO DESCRIBE HOW CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE LAYING THE STRUCTURE FOR CHANGES
WHICH WILL OCCUR IN LIBRARY BOOK ORDER SYSTEMS. EXISTING ON-LINE BOOK
INFORMATION DATA BASES WITH POTENTIAL FOR DOCUMENT DELIVERY ARE DISCUSSED.
LIMITS TO THEIR USE ARE CONSIDERED. THE PAPERS ASSUMES THAT PRINTED BOOKS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCED AND PURCHASED BY LIBRARIES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE,
BUT THAT INCREASINGLY FUNDS FOR PURCHASE OF BOOKS WILL BE DIVERTED TOWARD
ACQUISITION OF ELECTRONIC PUBLICATIONS.
PARTICIPATION OF TEACHING FACULTY IN LIBRARY BOOK SELECTION.
     
ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF A STUDY UNDERTAKEN FOR THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION OF A US
MIDWESTERN UNIVERSITY DESIGNED TO EXAMINE SELECTED FACTORS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO
INFLUENCE THE ACTIVENESS OF THE TEACHING FACULTY IN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN
LIBRARY BOOK SELECTION. SHOWS THAT THE FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY
CORRELATED TO THE DEGREE OF ACTIVITY IN BOOK SELECTION' YEARS OF TEACHING;
AGE; NUMBER OF GRADUATE COURSES TAUGHT; PUBLICATION ACTIVITIES; AND
PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS.
THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL
COOPERATION. (THE LIBRARY OF THE MATICA SRPSKA AND ITS BOOK EXCHANGE
ACTIVITIES).
     
DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS COLLECTIONS THE LIBRARY OF THE MATICA SRPSKA IN
NOVI SAD HOLDS ONE OF THE LEADING PLACES AMONG YUGOSLAV NATIONAL LIBRARIES.
FOUNDED IN THE 19TH CENTURY AS A GENERAL RESEARCH LIBRARY IT HAS TODAY THE
FUNCTION OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF THE AUTONOMOUS PROVINCE OF VOJVODINA AND
ALSO FULFILS THE FUNCTION OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. EXCHANGES OF PUBLICATIONS
ARE MAINTAINED WITH 215 INSTITUTIONS IN 40 COUNTRIES. OF THESE CONTACTS, THOSE
WITH NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES ARE OF A SPECIAL IMPORTANCE AS THEIR LIBRARIES AND
ARCHIVES ARE POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS OF MUCH NEEDED HISTORICAL MATERIAL CONNECTED
WITH VOJVODINA.
EXCHANGE AND BIBLIOGRAPHY OF DANISH OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS.
     
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, EITHER INTERGOVERNMENTAL OR BETWEEN EXCHANGE PARTNERS
CONCERNING THE EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN
DENMARK AND 14 FOREIGN STATES. THE DANISH EXCHANGE INSTITUTE (IDE) IS IN
CHARGE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. IDE RECEIVES THE DANISH PUBLICATIONS DIRECT FROM
THE ISSUING BODIES AND FORWARDS THEM TO THE FOREIGN PARTNERS. AT PRESENT
APPROXIMATELY 300 DANISH GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF THEIR
WORK. FOREIGN OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE ARE DISTRIBUTED TO
DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES ACCORDING TO THEIR FIELDS OF INTEREST, A HIGH DEGREE
OF SPECIALISATION BEING TYPICAL OF THE DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARY SYSTEM.
ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS' CO-OPERATION VERSUS CENTRALISATION.
     
THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR AN EFFICIENT AND PLANNED NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ACCESS
TO DOCUMENTS. DISCUSSES REASONS FOR INACTION IN THIS AREA AND CRITERIA FOR
NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY SYSTEMS. DESCRIBES 4 BASIC MODELS OF NATIONAL
INTERLENDING SYSTEMS' MODEL A IS ONE OF TOTAL CENTRALISATION ON 1 SOURCE;
MODEL B CONCENTRATES PROVISION ON 2 OR 3 LIBRARIES; MODEL C CONCENTRATES
SUPPLY ON A GREATER NUMBER OF LIBRARIES, SPECIALLY DESIGNATED AND FUNDED FOR
THE PURPOSE; AND MODEL D, WHICH EXISTS IN MOST COUNTRIES, IS 1 OF TOTAL
DECENTRALISATION. LOOKS AT COMBINATIONS OF THESE MODELS, THE ECONOMICS OF
CENTRALISATION, CENTRALISED 2VERSUS1 COOPERATIVE SOLUTIONS AND EFFECT OF
TECHNOLOGY.
INTERLIBRARY LOAN IN NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA AND THE NORTHERN RHINELAND
PALATINATE 1980.
     
RESULTS ARE GIVEN OF A SURVEY CARRIED OUT AT THE END OF 1980 FROM
QUESTIONNAIRES SENT TO OVER 260 LIBRARIES. REORGANISATION OF THE NORTH RHINE
WESTPHALIA LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN THE SUPER-REGIONAL INTERLIBRARY LOANS HAS
BEEN CARRIED OUT; IN 1980 THESE 181 LIBRARIES SUPPLIED OVER HALF A MILLION
BOOKS TO THE SCHEME. DETAILED INFORMATION IS INCLUDED ON NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL LOANS AND ON THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY THE TOP 12 LIBRARIES, WITH
SIMILAR INFORMATION CONCERNING LIBRARIES BORROWING THROUGH THE SCHEME. THE
PERIODICAL SPECIALISATION SCHEME RUN BY 7 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES SHOWS AN
INCREASE IN SERVICES OF 31.3%. INFORMATION IS ALSO INCLUDED ON LOANS WITHIN
THE REGION, ON PARISH LIBRARIES AND ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ISBN REGISTER.
FREEZE-DRYING-A METHOD TO SALVAGE SOAKED BOOKS.
     
134 VALUABLE OLD BOOKS WERE DAMAGED BY WATER FROM THE HOSES OF THE FIRE
BRIGADE WHEN A BUILDING USED AS STORAGE FOR THE ERZBISCHOFLICHE DIOZESAN- UND
DOMBIBLIOTHEK AT COLOGNE CAUGHT FIRE. AFTER FREEZING THE BOOKS AT -18 C IN A
COLD-STORAGE HOUSE THEY WERE DRIED IN A RENTED FREEZE-DRYING CHAMBER SOME
MONTHS LATER. THE BOOKS WERE RESTORED WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE, OTHER THAN TO THE
COVERS WHICH LOST FORM AND HAD TO BE REBOUND.
THE RESULTS ARE IN-PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS ARE WANTED.
     
UNTIL RECENTLY, LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN THE US HAVE OFFERED LITTLE OR NOTHING IN
THEIR CURRICULUM ABOUT PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS. A PROJECT, INITIATED
BY THE LIBRARY/BINDERS COMMITTEE OF THE ALA PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS
SECTION, WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF THE INTEREST IN
PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS. ATTENDEES OF RECENT WORKSHOPS WERE SURVEYED, AND
RESPONDEES INDICATED AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO ATTEND MORE WORKSHOPS AND TO
RECOMMEND WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE TO THEIR COLLEAGUES. RESPONSES ARE TABULATED IN
RELATION TO ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSES ABOUT PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS AND INTEREST
IN PRESERVATION WORKSHOP TOPICS.
A STUDY OF BASIC STANDARDS AND METHODS IN PRESENTATION AND RESTORATION
WORKSHOPS APPLICABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
THE GUIDE COVERS THE ORGANISATION AND PLANNING OF THE CONSERVATION OF ARCHIVES
MATERIALS; PRESENTATION AND RESTORATION TECHNIQUES (INCLUDING BINDING),
WORKSHOP LAYOUT AND ADMINISTRATION.
THE STATE POLICY IN THE FIELD OF PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY HOLDINGS.
     
OUTLINES THE BACKGROUND TO THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE IN THE PRESERVATION OF
MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS IN THE USSR, AND DESCRIBES THE RESEARCH AND PRACTICAL
WORK IN THIS AREA WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT IN MAJOR LIBRARIES, LABORATORIES,
CENTRES AND INSTITUTES. TECHNIQUES DISCUSSED INCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION OF
REASONS FOR DETERIORATION OF MATERIALS, AND WAYS OF FINDING THE MOST RELIABLE
MEANS AND METHODS OF CONSERVING AND RESTORING PAPER, PERGAMEN AND LEATHER
BASED DOCUMENTS.
CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION' A PROBLEM OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT' A BRITISH
LIBRARY VIEW.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES, MANILA,
AUG 80. DISCUSSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONCERNED WITH THE CONSERVATION AND
PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS, AND DESCRIBES THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S
APPROACH TO THE OVERALL PRESERVATION OF ITS STOCKS. HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE
OF MANAGEMENT IN PREVENTING DECAY, AND ARGUES THAT THE BASIC 'GOOD
HOUSEKEEPING' OF TIDINESS, CLEANLINESS, WATCHFULNESS IN THE MAINTENANCE OF
BOOKS AND LIBRARIES IS THE FOUNDATION OF PRESERVATION.
THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS.
     
DESCRIBES YALE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION PROGRAMME.
DISCUSSES BRIEFLY WORK WHICH HAS BEEN DONE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A GRANT FROM
THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES TO' SURVEY THE CONDITION OF THE
LIBRARY'S COLLECTIONS; STUDY PROCEDURES IN PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND HANDLING
OF LIBRARY MATERIALS TO CORRECT HARMFUL AND DESTRUCTIVE PRACTICES; AND TO
PRODUCE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WHICH WILL BENEFIT YALE AND OTHER LIBRARIES.
A NATIONAL PRESERVATION PROGRAM FOR LIBRARY MATERIALS IN CANADA.
     
A SHORTENED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED UNDER THE SAME TITLE TO THE
CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES, MANILA, AUG 80. ARGUES THAT A
COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL PRESERVATION POLICY FOR CANADA IS URGENTLY NEEDED, AND
DISCUSSES THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH A POLICY. THESE INCLUDE' THE PRESERVATION
OF THE INTELLECTUAL CONTENT OF DETERIORATING MATERIALS; THE PRESERVATION AND
RESTORATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS THAT ARE VALUABLE BEYOND THE INFORMATION THEY
CONTAIN; ENSURING THE PRESERVATION OF FUTURE LIBRARY MATERIALS THROUGH
PREVENTION CONSERVATION; AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PRESERVATION AWARENESS
PROGRAMME TO EDUCATE AND INFORM LIBRARIANS OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEMS,
AND THE MEASURES WHICH COULD BE TAKEN TO ALLEVIATE IT.
CHANGING WORLD OF LIBRARY BINDING PART 1.
     
DISCUSSES DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WORLD OF LIBRARY BINDING, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT
OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT AT THE TESTING LABORATORY OF THE LIBRARY BINDING
INSTITUTE OF THE ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. (THE PAPER WAS 1ST
PUBLISHED IN 2PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS1, ED. BY JOYCE R. RUSSELL, NEW
YORK, SLA, 1980).
THE INSIGHTS OF BINDING INVESTMENTS.
     
REVIEWS THE LIBRARY BINDING SUGGESTIONS AND COMMENTS MADE BY THE REGIONAL
EDITORS OF 2LIBRARY SCENE1. COMMENTS ARE INCLUDED ON CONFIDENCE IN THE BINDER,
CLASSES OF BINDING, SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE BINDINGS, EXPECTED USE OF A
VOLUME AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO BINDING, AND OVERSEWING.
A BIND-AID FOR HURT BOOKS IS INVALUABLE.
     
HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE, TO LIBRARIANS AND BINDERS ALIKE, OF CHOOSING THE
APPROPRIATE BINDING, AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS METHODS USED BY SOME US
LIBRARIANS TO ENSURE THAT BOOKS ARE APPROPRIATELY BOUND. PROVIDES A CHECKLIST
WHICH CAN BE USED TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT BOOKS NEED TO BE SENT FOR BINDING.
ADHESIVES FOR LIBRARY BINDING.
     
DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADHESIVES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO BINDERS FOR
USE IN PUTTING THE SEQUENCE OF PRINTED PAGES TOGETHER TO FORM A BOOK.
DESCRIBES THE USE, AND APPROPRIATE APPLICATIONS OF' ANIMAL GLUE; STARCH
PASTES; SYNTHETIC RESIN EMULSIONS; AND HOT METAL ADHESIVES.
BINDERS BOARD-THE ONLY COVERBOARD USED IN LIBRARY BINDING.
     
BINDER'S BOARD IS HIGHEST QUALITY PULP BOARD MADE TO FULL THICKNESS IN 1
OPERATION, FOR USE IN BINDING. ITS DENSITY IS ALMOST TWICE THAT OF WOOD AND
ITS TRUE VALUE HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNISED BY LIBRARY BINDERS' ONLY A BOARD WITH
SUPERIOR WORKING QUALITIES WILL QUALIFY FOR CLASS 'A' BINDING. DESCRIBES IN
DETAIL THE PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING BINDERS BOARD.
UPON LOOKING BACK.
     
DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE US LIBRARY BINDING INDUSTRY AND THE WORK OF
THE LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. WELCOMES THE FACT THAT
INCREASING NUMBERS OF LIBRARIANS ARE STARTING TO BECOME MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE
NEED TO PRESERVE THEIR COLLECTIONS. DISCUSSES THE VARIOUS AREAS IN WHICH
LIBRARY BINDERS NEED TO STRIVE TO PRESERVE QUALITY.
THE OVERRATED PLB-A FIASCO TO FIX.
     
THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BINDING (PLB), ADVOCATED FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN THE
EARLY 1950S BY THE ALA ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN (THEN
CHILDREN'S SERVICES DIVISION), HAS BEEN A FIASCO. PLBS VARY IN QUALITY AND
SOME LAST NO MORE THAN A FEW CIRCULATIONS. IT IS ESPECIALLY FOOLISH FOR LARGE
LIBRARIES TO BUY ANY PLB THEY DO NOT NEED BECAUSE THEIR 38-40% TRADE DISCOUNTS
MAKE THEM BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE INEQUITABLE PLB NET PRICING SYSTEMS. REVIEWS
THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY PLB AND CONTENDS THAT BINDING STANDARDS MUST BE SET
WHICH CATER FOR BOOKS LESS DURABLE THAN LBI CLASS 'A' STANDARDS AND WHICH
NULLIFY THE OBFUSCATING PRICING SCHEMES.
WORDS TO THE WISE.
     
REVIEWS THE PROCEEDINGS AT A SEMINAR ON DISASTER PLANNING AND IN-HOUSE
CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS HELD AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL
OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. BRIEFLY SUMMARISES THE ADVICE WHICH WAS
GIVEN AT THE SEMINAR ON' PREPARING A DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN; COPING WITH FLOOD
AND FIRE; AND THE CARE OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.
PATTERN OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
     
EXPLAINS THE DECLINING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN PAPUA NEW
GUINEA SINCE 1977 AND INVESTIGATES ITS EFFECT ON LIBRARY USE BY LOOKING AT
BOOK LOANS IN 7 LIBRARIES DURING 1977-81. DISCUSSES POSSIBLE OTHER INFLUENCES
ON LOANS IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE CONFLICTING TRENDS EXPOSED BY THE
INVESTIGATION.
COMPUTERIZING CIRCULATION SYSTEMS.
     
ATTEMPTS TO HELP THE LIBRARIAN ARRIVE AT A DECISION REGARDING THE POSSIBLE
COMPUTERISATION OF A CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM, AND TO SELECT THE MOST
APPROPRIATE SOLUTION FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION
APPROACHES MOST LIKELY TO RESULT IN SUCCESSFUL INSTALLATION AND SATISFACTORY
RESULTS. DEFINES SOME COMMONLY-USED TERMS AND DISCUSSES THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS
THAT MUST BE UNDERTAKEN IN ORDER TO DECIDE ON AND IMPLEMENT A CIRCULATION
CONTROL SYSTEM. ALSO MENTION SOURCES OF ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO ONTARIO
LIBRARIANS.
IS SUCH AN INVESTIGATION WORTHY OF KL?.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES
(KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (KL)) ON THE TRIAL RUN OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES'
AUTOMATION SYSTEM, FAUST, IN OLSTYKKE LIBRARY. GIVES THE REASONS FOR THE
FAILURE OF FAUST AS LACK OF PERCEIVED ECONOMIC RETURNS, OPPOSITION OF THE
LIBRARIANS' UNION ON THE GROUNDS OF STAFF REDUCTIONS, AND SIZE OF INITIAL
INVESTMENTS. THE FEW LIBRARIANS WHO POINTED TO IMPROVED SERVICE AND LONG-TERM
ECONOMIC BENEFITS WERE OVERRULED. BIBLIOTEKSDATA, WHICH REPLACED FAUST IN
1978, IS MORE DECENTRALISED, WITH SERVICES TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIES' NEEDS. ARGUES THAT KL IN ITS REPORT DISMISSES THE VALUE OF THE
TRIAL RUN AND THE STAFF'S VIEWS OF THE EXPERIMENT, WHICH STRESS THE
LABOUR-SAVING EFFECTS OF THE AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM. CALLS FOR CENTRAL
REGISTRATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES' STOCK IN THE COMMON DATA BASE BY THE LIBRARY
CENTRE; THEN THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY CAN BEGIN REGISTRATION OF ITS OWN STO CK
AND START USING AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL WITH ENSUING IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE
AND LABOUR ECONOMIES.
COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION CONTROL IS STARTED AND A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY IS
OPENED.
     
A COMPUTERISED SYSTEM KILAVA CONTROLS LENDING AND RELATED HOUSEKEEPING
ROUTINES AT NASTOLA CENTRAL LIBRARY. IN ADDITION SOME MANAGEMENT INFORMATION,
SUCH AS INFORMATION ABOUT FREQUENTLY AND RARELY BORROWED BOOKS CAN BE
OBTAINED. IN THE PLANNING STAGE NEW BORROWER INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED AND THE
TITLE REGISTER OF THE COLLECTION WAS CREATED. AT PRESENT THE SYSTEM IS BATCH
PROCESSED WEEKLY. THE BUDGET FOR THE SYSTEM WAS 100,000 FINNISH MARKS. THE
HARDWARE AND THE RIGHT TO USE THE PROGRAMME COST 80,000 MARKS. THE SYSTEM
BECAME OPERATIONAL ON THE DAY OF THE OPENING OF THE NEW MAIN LIBRARY BUILDING
AT NASTOLA IN SEPT 81.
THE COST OF COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION CONTROL IN MIKKELI.
     
THE INSTALLATION OF THE COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEM AT MIKKELI
LIBRARY AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE WILL BE ABOUT 150,000 FINNISH MARKS, OF WHICH
THE COMPUTER AND THE PERIPHERALS WILL COST 98,200 MARKS. THE ANNUAL RUNNING
COST IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT 72,000 MARKS. THE SYSTEM WILL PERFORM THE
FOLLOWING' BORROWER INDEX, WRITE TICKETS, CONTROL LENDING, RETURNED BOOK
RESERVATIONS, CANCELLATION OF RESERVATIONS, REMINDERS, FINES, STATISTICAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLECTION, ARRIVAL OF RESERVED BOOKS, AND GENERAL
STATISTICS FOR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION. CATALOGUING WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE
SYSTEM SOON.
SHARING AN ONLINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM-THE PLANNING, THE PRACTICE AND THE
POTENTIAL.
     
LONDON UNIVERSITY IS INSTALLING AN ON-LINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE
SHARED BY A NUMBER OF ITS AUTONOMOUS SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTES, PROVIDING ECONOMY
OF SCALE. THE TURNKEY SYSTEM WAS SUPPLIED BY GEAC COMPUTERS LTD., WITH
MODIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR SHARED NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY WHILST RETAINING
FLEXIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES. THE CENTRAL EQUIPMENT IS LOCATED AT THE
SENATE HOUSE AND IS BEING LINKED BY LEASED AND PRIVATE LINES TO TERMINALS IN
THE 7 LIBRARIES PARTICIPATING IN THIS 1ST PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT.
PHOTOCOPYING RIGHTS AND WRONGS' A LIBRARIAN'S VIEW.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE, INFORMATION '81'
FORECASTS AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. ARGUES AGAINST
THE INTRODUCTION OF A LICENCE FOR MULTIPLE PHOTOCOPYING AS PROPOSED BY THE
WHITFORD REPORT OF 1977 AND CRITICISES THE COMMITTEE OF U.K. COPYRIGHT OWNERS
ON LICENSING OF PHOTOCOPYING CHAIRED BY LORD WOLFENDEN. DISCUSSES THE GREEN
PAPER 2REFORM OF THE LAW RELATING TO COPYRIGHT, DESIGNS AND PERFORMERS'
PROTECTION' A CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT 1(CMND. 8302) AND LICENSING PROPOSALS
PRODUCED BY UK PUBLISHERS. PRESENTS ALTERNATIVES TO LICENSING OF CODES OF
PRACTICE AND A COPYRIGHT AGENCY.
THE CASE FOR COPYRIGHT.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE, INFORMATION '81'
FORECASTS AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. ARGUES FOR THE
LICENSING OF PHOTOCOPYING FROM THE UK PUBLISHERS' POINT OF VIEW, SHOWING HOW
THE PRESENT COPYRIGHT ACT IS DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.
PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION IN THEATER LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
PROBLEMS IN CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFYING THEATRE RESOURCES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP. THE UNSUITABILITY OF
MAJOR EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THEATRE COLLECTIONS HAS
PROMPTED LIBRARIANS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS AND ORIGINAL
CLASSIFICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTIONS OF NON-BOOK, OR 'FUGITIVE',
THEATRICAL MEMORABILIA ARE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE PROPERLY, GIVEN
THE DESPERATE FINANCIAL SITUATION FACING MANY THEATRE COLLECTIONS. US SURVEY
DATA ON CURRENT PRACTICES INDICATE A STRONG TREND TOWARD STANDARDISATION OF
PROCEDURES IN CLASSIFYING, YET A CONTINUING DIVERSITY IN CATALOGUING METHODS.
THE COMING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, ALONG WITH INCREASED AWARENESS AMONG
THEATRE LIBRARIANS AND INPUT FROM CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, MAY
HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.
HOW DO LIBRARIES CATALOGUE.
     
THE WORKING GROUP ON CATALOGUING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEYED THE FINNISH
PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT CATALOGUING METHODS IN PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. 461 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT AND 409 WERE RETURNED. THE WORKING
GROUP IS DESIGNING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
JUST OVER 70% OF THE RESPONDENTS USE FINNISH CATALOGUING RULES. JUST UNDER 50%
OF THE RESPONDENTS USE THEIR OWN SUBJECT INDEXING AND NEARLY 87% OF THE
RESPONDENTS USE THE 1975 EDITION OF THE FINNISH CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON
DEWEY. OVER 50% USE THE CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICE OF KIRJASTOPALVELU OY,
AND NEARLY 60% OF THE RESPONDING LIBRARY AUTHORITIES UNDERTAKE CENTRALISED
CATALOGUING.
A LITTLE BRIEF AUTHORITY' A MANUAL FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A NAME
AUTHORITY FILE.
     
GUIDELINES ON THE PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A NAME AUTHORITY FILE FOR A
CARD CATALOGUE, BASED ON EXPERIENCES AT THE SIMMONS COLLEGE LIBRARY TECHNICAL
SERVICES DIVISION, BOSTON, MASS.
LIBRARY CATALOG DESIGN.
     
COMPUTERISATION MAKES POSSIBLE ENLARGEMENT OF THE PURPOSE AND MEANS FOR
ATTAINING PURPOSE OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES PROVIDE THE
FUNCTIONS OF TRADITIONAL CATALOGUES TOGETHER WITH IMPORTANT NEW FUNCTIONS.
IN THE IRON AGE OF CATALOGUING.
     
CUTTER DESCRIBED THE 19TH CENTURY HISTORY OF CATALOGUING AS THE GOLDEN AGE.
EXTENDS THIS METAPHOR TO THE 20TH CENTURY TO ELUCIDATE CURRENT TRENDS IN
CATALOGUING, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING THE USE OF THE COMPUTER. DOES THE
AUTOMATION OF THE CATALOGUE REPRESENT A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE THAT WILL FREE
US FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAIN ENTRY AND PROVIDE FOR CUTTER'S 2ND OBJECT?
ARGUES THAT THE CATALOGUING TRADITION OF PANIZZI, CUTTER, AND LUBETZKY WILL BE
EVEN MORE VALID, AND THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF
CATALOGUING WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE.
BILD-INTEGRATED ONLINE SYSTEM FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS LIBRARIES.
     
BILD, BIBLIOGRAPHIC INDEX OF LIBRARY DOCUMENTS IS THE NEW INTEGRATED ON-LINE
SYSTEM DEVELOPED FOR THE HELSINKI SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS LIBRARY. IT CONSISTS OF
THE ACQUISITION, CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY.
THERE IS ALSO A SEARCH PROGRAM FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AVAILABLE. THE SYSTEM
WAS TESTED DURING THE WINTER 1980-81.
A SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP)-A NEW TEST DATABASE FOR ESA-QUEST.
     
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT, A NEW VERSION OF
ON-LINE-CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. IT IS AN
EFFECTIVE AID FOR SEARCHES BY SUBJECT AS WELL AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA. THE IDEA
OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN FROM THE BOOKS
THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF THE INHERENT ATTRIBUTES OF A PUBLICATION.
TO MAKE POSSIBLE A DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF SAP-INDEXING TECHNIQUE
THE DATA BASE HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO ESA-QUEST AS A TEST FILE.
PICA (PROJECT GEINTEGREERDE CATALOGUS AUTOMATISERING) AT THE START OF THE
1980S.
     
IN 1977 THE PICA (PROJECT FOR INTEGRATED CATALOGUE AUTOMATION) SYSTEM BECAME
OPERATIONAL IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE PICA NETWORK IS THE RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT
CONCLUDED BY THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND UNIVERSITIES IN 1969. IN ADDITION A
NUMBER OF OTHER LIBRARIES, INCLUDING LEEUWAARDEN COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE PUBLIC
LIBRARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND THE HAGUE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK AS 'CUSTOMER'
LIBRARIES. OVERALL SUPERVISION OF THE NETWORK IS MAINTAINED BY THE PICA BUREAU
LOCATED IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY. MEMBER LIBRARIES CONTRIBUTE CATALOGUE RECORDS
VIA ON-LINE VISUAL DISPLAY TERMINALS DIRECT TO THE CENTRAL DATA BASE, FROM
WHICH OUTPUT MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE FORM OF CATALOGUE CARDS, PAPER PRINTOUT OR
MICROFICHE. IN 1982 THE CENTRAL DATA BASE WILL BE ADAPTED FOR USE IN
ACQUISITION AND LOANS CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN 1983 WILL BE USED FOR THE
NATIONAL INTERLIBRARY-LENDING NETWORK.
THE CASE OF THE MISSING SUBTITLE.
     
WITH REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT PASSAGES IN AACR2 AND ISBD(G), NOTES THE
ELIMINATION OF THE TERM 'SUBTITLE' AND THE RESULTANT DIFFICULTIES. SUBTITLES
WILL NOT DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER CALLED BY THAT NAME. THE
TERM MUST BE REINSTATED IN THE OFFICIAL VOCABULARY OF CATALOGUING AND
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF 'TITLE PROPER' AND 'SUBTITLE' FORMULATED. SUCH
ACTION WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS UNIFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES,
LEAVING MUCH LESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CATALOGUES AND
RESULTING IN GREATER ENTRY STANDARDISATION.
REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON CATALOG USAGE.
     
AFTER CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF AACR2 ON THE PRESENT CATALOGUE SYSTEM, THIS
TASK FORCE ON CATALOGUE USAGE RECOMMENDS THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY RETAIN
THE PRESENT CATALOGUE BEYOND 1981 AND LATER ADOPT AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. REPORT
NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
COMMITTEE ON THE FUTURE OF THE CARD CATALOG.
     
THIS FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE FUTURE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CONSIDERS THE EVALUATIVE REPORTS OF 3 TASK FORCES ON
THE EFFECTS OF AACR2 AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SET AS A TOP
PRIORITY GOAL THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ON-LINE
CATALOGUE, BY 1983. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
PREPARATION OF SPECIALIZED INDEXES AND ITS NECESSITIES IN REFERENCE SERVICES
(IN JAPANESE).
     
ORIGINALLY PRESENTED AT THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MEDICAL
LIBRARIANSHIP HELD IN BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA, 2-5 SEPT 80. ON-LINE LITERATURE
RETRIEVAL SERVICES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN JAPAN ARE JOIS, TOOL-IR, IDEAS/77,
DIALOG, AND ORBIT. GENERAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LITERATURE RETRIEVAL
SERVICES ARE: (1) DATA BASES DO NOT COVER CERTAIN PRIMARY SOURCES; (2)
SECONDARY SOURCES IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SUCH AS IGAKU CHUO ZASSHI AND BERICHITE
& ZENTRALBLATTER ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON-LINE; (3) INDEXING OF INFORMATION IS NOT
EXCLUSIVE, EVEN IF THE PRIMARY SOURCE IS COVERED BY THE DATA BASE. IN ORDER TO
COMPENSATE FOR THESE PROBLEMS, THE NIPPON MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PRODUCES
INDEX CARDS FOR SPECIAL FEATURE ARTICLES WHICH ARE NOT EASILY RETRIEVED,
SYNDROMES OF DISEASES, AND MEETINGS HELD BY SOCIETIES WITHOUT OFFICIAL
PUBLICATIONS.
THE IMPACT OF AACR 2' A REVIEW OF RESEARCH.
     
A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF AACR REVISION ON EXISTING
CATALOGUES AND DETAILS OF RESEARCH STUDIES CARRIED OUT TO MEASURE SUCH
EFFECTS.
APPLYING AACR2 IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA LIBRARIES.
     
REVIEWS SOME OF THE DEBATE OF THE PAST FEW YEARS CONCERNING THE ANGLO-AMERICAN
CATALOGUING RULES (2ND EDITION); EXPLAINS SOME OF THE NEW RELATED TOOLS THAT
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND ACCEPTED IN LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING
WORLD; STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF AACR 2 FOR PAPUA NEW GUINEAN LIBRARIANS AND
LIBRARY USERS; AND URGES ALL LIBRARIES (ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LARGE AND VERY
SPECIALISED COLLECTIONS) TO ADOPT AACR 2.
THE CATALOGING OF SERIALS IN MICROFORM UNDER AACR 2 RULES.
     
UNTIL THE PUBLICATION OF 2AACR 2,1 THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGING RULES
DICTATED THAT MICROFORM REPRODUCTIONS BE CATALOGUED UNDER THE GENERAL RULES
FOR MONOGRAPHS, SERIALS, MUSIC, ETC., THE CHIEF SOURCE OF INFORMATION BEING
THE TITLE PAGE OF THE ORIGINAL. 2AACR 2 1RULES REVERSE THIS PRACTICE AND
SEPARATE THE ORIGINAL FROM THE FILM REPRODUCTION IN THE CATALOGUE AND IN TURN
DO A DISSERVICE TO THE USER.
AACR 2 AND LEGAL MATERIALS.
     
REVIEWS THE RULES IN AACR2 WHICH APPLY TO LEGAL MATERIALS. CONCLUDES THAT THE
NEW CODE IS BETTER THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT IS STILL LIKELY TO CAUSE CONFUSION
AND HINDER THE LOCATION OF INFORMATION.
GERMAN ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING RULES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND FOR ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES.
     
AT THE MEETINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 81 THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN
LIBRARY INSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING WAS CONCERNED WITH
THE DRAFT VERSION OF RAK-OB. LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TEND TO ACCEPT THIS IF
THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY OPTED FOR THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY VERSION BUT SMALLER
PUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCKING MAINLY GERMAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL ARE CRITICAL OF THE
DRAFT. IT WAS DECIDED, THEREFORE, THAT ALTERNATIVES FOR SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES
BE INCLUDED IN RAK-OB WITH REFERENCE TO PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE BODIES, UNIT
SUBJECT HEADINGS, PARALLEL HEADINGS, SUBORDINATE ENTRIES, ENTRIES FOR
MUSICALIA AND SOUND RECORDINGS FOR CHILDREN. RAK-OB AND RAK-WB MUST NOT DIFFER
ON BASIC PRINCIPLES BUT ARE TO BE KEPT PHYSICALLY SEPARATE. RAK-OB'S 2ND DRAFT
PLAN WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON.
A CRITICAL SURVEY OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES.
     
EFFORTS MADE SINCE THE MID 19TH CENTURY TO PRODUCE ALPHABETICAL UNION
CATALOGUES OF ALL BOOKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THE
DIFFICULTY OF ACCESS TO SOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY STOCKS, BY INACCURATE
CATALOGUING IN INSTITUTE LIBRARIES AND BY THE QUESTIONABLE VALUE OF A CENTRAL
CATALOGUE WITHIN PURCHASING POLICY. SINCE 1970, HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL OPINION
HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IN FAVOUR OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES; WORK IN
THIS FIELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IS DESCRIBED AND EVALUATED THROUGH ANALYSIS
OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN FIGURES. THESE CATALOGUES SHOULD BE PRODUCED ONLY WHEN
CERTAIN CONDITIONS PREVAIL, E.G. WHEN INSTITUTE STOCK SUBJECT COVERAGE IS MUCH
WIDER THAN THAT OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHEN ACCESS TO THE UNION CATALOGUE IS
EASY AND WHEN THE CATALOGUE CAN BE PRODUCED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO OTHER WORK.
COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF OLD PRINTED WORKS IN CYRILLIC AND GLAGOLITIC CHARACTERS'
BASIC THEORY AND METHODOLOGY.
     
THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING DEMAND FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF CYRILLIC AND
GLAGOLITIC PRINTED WORKS OF THE 15TH-17TH CENTURIES. IN 1979 THE 1ST VOLUME OF
A COMPLETE CATALOGUE WAS PUBLISHED BY THE LENIN LIBRARY. THE 2DESCRIPTION OF
OLD PRINTED WORKS IN CYRILLIC CHARACTERS1 IS IN MANY WAYS A TRIAL EDITION. THE
METHODOLOGY USED PRESENTS A CHRONOLOGICAL CATALOGUE OF THE OLD PRINTED WORKS
WITH SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS, DETAILS OF ALL KNOWN COPIES AND THEIR
WHEREABOUTS. A 2ND TYPE OF PUBLICATION IS BEING PREPARED SIMULTANEOUSLY' THE
DESCRIPTION OF OLD CYRILLIC (EVENTUALLY ALSO GLAGOLITIC) CHARACTERS (PRINTED
WORKS) FROM PARTICULAR PRINTERS. CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS THE WORK OF CATALOGUING
THE MATERIAL ARE COMING FROM LIBRARIES OF ALL THE SLAVIC NATIONS AND FROM
SCHOLARS OF THE SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
UNION CATALOGUE OF RUSSIAN SATIRICAL PERIODICALS 1905-1907.
     
DESCRIBES THE PROJECT FOR THE COMPILATION OF THE UNION CATALOGUE OF RUSSIAN
SATIRICAL PERIODICALS (1905-1907) UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOSUDARSTVENNAYA
BIBLIOTEKA SSSR IM. V.I.LENINA (LENIN STATE LIBRARY) AND 40 OTHER LIBRARIES.
THE CATALOGUE CONTAINS AROUND 300 TITLES FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT PERIOD IN THE
HISTORY OF RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY PRESS. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
DURING THE RESEARCH AND COMPILATION ARE DESCRIBED AND A SHORT HISTORICAL
ACCOUNT GIVEN OF EFFORTS TO CATALOGUE THIS KIND OF MATERIAL UNTIL NOW. THE
UNION CATALOGUE IS SUPPLEMENTED BY PERSONAL AND CORPORATE NAME INDEXES
INCLUDING PUBLISHERS, EDITORS, AUTHORS AND ARTISTS. THERE IS ALSO A
CHRONOLOGICAL INDEX AND A PUBLISHERS INDEX ARRANGED BY TOWNS.
PLANS FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOG AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.
     
THE INCREASING SIZE, COST, AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CARD CATALOGUE HAS CAUSED THE
LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN TO BEGIN PLANNING
FOR AN ON-LINE PUBLIC CATALOGUE. THE LIBRARY HAS DECIDED TO USE THE SOFTWARE
OF THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK (WLN) AS THE BASIS FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE
WHILE CONTINUING TO USE OCLC AS A SOURCE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS. THE PLANS
FOR REPLICATING THE WLN SOFTWARE AT ILLINOIS AS AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE AND THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR STATEWIDE RESOURCE SHARING ARE DISCUSSED.
THE PENNSYLVANIA UNION LIST OF SERIALS INITIAL DEVELOPMENT.
     
THE PENNSYLVANIA UNION LIST OF SERIALS IS A NEW PROJECT FUNDED BY THE STATE
LIBRARY OF PENNSYLVANIA. IN 1979 IT AWARDED THE PITTSBURGH REGIONAL LIBRARY
CENTER $99,304 IN LSCA TITLE III FUNDS FOR FIRST YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF A
STATEWIDE UNION LIST WHICH WILL BE ON-LINE THROUGH OCLC. PRLC'S HISTORY OF
WORKING WITH ON-LINE UNION LISTS IS REVIEWED, AND PLANS FOR THE FIRST YEAR ARE
DESCRIBED. INITIALLY, THERE WILL BE CONCENTRATION ON SYSTEM DESIGN. AT THE
SAME TIME, A CORE LIST OF APPROXIMATELY 2,000 TITLES WILL BE SELECTED, AS WILL
THE LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE DURING 1979-1980. FUTURE PLANS WILL CONSIDER SOME
DECENTRALISATION.
SOME LINGUISTIC ASPECTS OF DUAL NATURE OF PATENT DOCUMENTATION.
     
LINGUISTIC EFFECTS OF CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN LEGAL AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF
PATENT INFORMATION ARE EXAMINED. LINGUISTIC METHODS OF FORMULATING THE
PATENTS' INDICATORS, VARIANTS OF THEIR AMALGAMATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN THE
LIMITED AND DISTINCTIVE PARTS OF THE FORMULA ARE DISCUSSED. SPECIAL ATTENTION
IS PAID TO THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN LINEAR AND STRUCTURAL ORDER OF PATENT
INDICATORS AND THEIR COMPONENTS. CRITERIA FOR OPTIMAL SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE ARE
INTRODUCED AND SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY OF THE FORMULA IS EVALUATED. THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTIC RECOMMENDATION ENABLING ONE TO
BUILD THE OPTIMAL FORMULA WITHOUT BREAKING GRAMMATICAL RULES, STYLE AND LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS IS STRESSED.
CLASSIFICATION AS A STRUCTURAL TYPE OF SUBLANGUAGES OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
     
DISCUSSES SOME ASPECTS OF THE STRUCTURE AND LEXICAL COMPOSITION ANALYSIS OF
THE SUBLANGUAGES OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBILITIES OF
THE SIMULTANEOUS USE OF CLASSIFICATIONS (PARTICULARLY SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS)
AS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE AND AS A SUBLANGUAGE OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY.
CLASSIFICATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY.
     
CRITICISES THE PLACING OF 'HOMOSEXUALITY' IN 2 CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS, DEWEY
(NORWEGIAN SUBJECT INDEX 1979) AND ARNESEN, THE NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY
(SUBJECT INDEX 1969). BOTH MAKE THE UNTENABLE ASSUMPTION THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS
BY DEFINITION A SEXUAL DEVIATION. IN RECENT YEARS HOMOSEXUAL ORGANISATIONS
HAVE WON SOME SYMPATHY FOR THEIR VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY AS A WAY OF LIFE AS
VALID AS HETEROSEXUALITY, BUT THIS ASPECT IS NOT REPRESENTED IN THE TABLES.
EVEN THE MOST NEUTRAL PLACING, 301.45 MINORITIES, HAS OVERTONES OF INFERIORITY
AND DISCRIMINATION.
UDC AND HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES.
     
THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE GIVEN IN A UDC CONFERENCE IN JYVASKYLA IN SPRING 81:
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PRESENT UDC; UDC AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION HANDLING; CHAIN
INDEXING; CATALOGUING FINNISH LITERATURE; AND CENTRALISED CATALOGUING. ONE OF
THE MAJOR PROBLEMS OF UDC IS ITS SLOW MACHINERY FOR REVISION. THE STRUCTURE OF
THE SCHEME IS WELL SUITED FOR AUTOMATIC APPLICATION. UDC IS USED FOR THE
CLASSIFICATION OF LEGAL DEPOSIT MATERIALS IN FINLAND. THE PRESENT FINNISH
EDITION OF THE SCHEME NEEDS URGENT REVISION, PARTICULARLY IN THE HUMANITIES
SUBJECTS.
TEXTBOOK CLASSIFICATION SCHEME. A REPORT FROM THE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS REVIEW
CENTER (EDMARC).
     
A TEXTBOOK CLASSIFICATION SCHEME THAT ALLOWS THE EXPRESSION OF CURRICULAR
RELATIONSHIPS IS REVISED TO INCLUDE NEW CURRICULUM MATERIALS FOR MATHS,
SCIENCE, SPECIAL EDUCATION, CAREER EDUCATION, FOREIGN LANGUAGES, AND SOCIAL
STUDIES. DESIGNED FOR TEACHER TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, CURRICULUM LABORATORIES,
RESOURCE CENTRES, AND COLLECTIONS IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES, THIS SCHEME CAN BE USED
SEPARATELY OR TO SUPPLEMENT STANDARD CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS, WHICH, WHILE THEY
HAVE PROVISION FOR TEXTBOOKS, DO NOT MAKE PLAIN THE CURRICULAR RELATIONSHIPS
INVOLVED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
MEDLARS INDEXING INSTRUCTIONS, TUMOR KEY SUPPLEMENT 1981.
     
THIS INDEXING GUIDE, DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDLARS INDEXERS AND SEARCHERS, IS
INTENDED AS A GUIDE TO THE CORRECT MESH (MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING) TERM FOR
VARIOUS HISTOLOGICAL TYPES OF TUMOUR AND CANCER.
COUPLING OF COMPUTER PROCESSED INDEXES TO A PHOTOCOMPOSING UNIT TO IMPROVE THE
READABILITY.
     
DESCRIBES THE DETAILS OF A PROJECT UNDERTAKEN TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF
IMPROVING THE READABILITY OF A COMPUTER ASSISTED INDEX (PRESENTLY BROUGHT OUT
BY A LINE PRINTER) BY TAKING THE OUTPUT ONTO A PAPER TAPE IN A COMPATIBLE
MANNER THAT CAN BE FED TO A FILM SETTER DIRECTLY TO PROVIDE LOWER-CASE LETTERS
AND ITALIC FOUNTS, WITH A FLEXIBILITY OF VARYING THE POINT SIZE.
ALTERED KEYWORD IN CONTEXT (AKWIC) INDEXING.
     
THE DEFINITION OF KWIC INDEX, ITS ORIGIN AND THE METHOD OF PRODUCTION IS
DESCRIBED. IT IS STRESSED THAT CONTINUITY OF THE CONTEXT AT THE EXTREME EDGES
SHOULD BE MAINTAINED WHENEVER THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF A TITLE FORMS PART
OF A KWIC ENTRY. A MODIFICATION IN THE OUTPUT FORMAT OF THE KWIC INDEX WHICH
CAN BE TERMED THE 'ALTERED KWIC' OR AKWIC INDEX, HAS BEEN SUGGESTED.
ADVANTAGES OF AKWIC OVER KWIC ARE MENTIONED. SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF KWIC
AND AKWIC ARE POINTED OUT. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ADOPTION OF KWIC INDEX BY
INDIAN PERIODICALS AND ORGANISATIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.
THESAURI IN INFORMATICS.
     
THE THESAURUS IS CONSIDERED AS A DEFINITE STRUCTURED SYSTEM OF SEMANTIC UNITS
WITH A DEVELOPED SET OF RELATIONS. QUESTIONS CONCERNING CORRELATIONS BETWEEN
THE THESAURUS AND DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS AND BETWEEN BRANCH THESAURI ARE
CLARIFIED. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TEXTS AND THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS
ARE INVESTIGATED.
A GENERAL THESAURUS FOR THE GERMAN LIBRARY. PILOT STUDY.
     
THE KIND AND FORM OF THE TERMS USED BY THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK (DB) WERE
ANALYSED FOR SUBJECT DESCRIPTION AND TESTED FOR THEIR SUITABILITY AS ELEMENTS
OF A GENERAL LIBRARY THESAURUS.
THESAURUS FOR URBAN ROADS.
     
THE THESAURUS WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR USE IN THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SAO
PAULO FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN STUDIES. IN A FULL INTRODUCTION, THE
TREATMENT OF TERMINOLOGY AND THE STRUCTURAL BASIS ARE DISCUSSED, WITH NOTES ON
THE STYLE OF PRESENTATION. THE THESAURUS ITSELF IS GIVEN IN FULL, IN FIVE
SECTIONS' A HIERARCHICAL PLAN, ALPHABETICAL LIST OF TERMS, SYSTEMATIC LIST OF
DESCRIPTORS, HIERARCHICAL INDEX OF DESCRIPTORS, AND GLOSSARY.
A SET OF NORMATIVE AND METHODICAL DOCUMENTS FOR LINGUISTIC SUPPORT TO GASNTI.
     
DESCRIBES THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENTS DETERMINING THE
PROCEDURES OF CREATION, MAINTENANCE, AND USE OF 'LINGUISTIC SUPPORTIVE
MATERIALS' IN GASNTI (STATE AUTOMATED SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM). PRESENTS THE CONTENTS OF SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS AND DISCUSSES THEIR
STATUS, APPLICATION AREA, AND TERMS OF USE. PAYS SPECIAL ATTENTION TO
DOCUMENTS REGULATING THE USE OF 'LINGUISTIC SUPPORTIVE MATERIALS' UNDER
NETWORK CONDITIONS.
COMPUTER-AIDED INDEXING IN THE ARTS' THE CASE FOR A THESAURUS OF ART TERMS.
     
PAPER DELIVERED TO THE ART LIBRARIES SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA CONFERENCE, SAN
FRANCISCO, 22 FEB 81. DESCRIBES HOW SUBJECT INDEXING ACTIVITIES IN ART ARE
BEING AIDED BY THE USE OF COMPUTERS; NOTES THE CURRENT STATE OF DISARRAY AMONG
ART SUBJECT INDEXING SYSTEMS; AND SUGGESTS THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF A
STANDARDISED VOCABULARY WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT ADJUNCT TO COMPUTERISED
INDEXING.
EVALUATION OF THE WORKING OF A SPECIALISED DATA AUTOMATED INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR CHEMISTRY.
     
A SOVIET NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR CHEMISTRY, FTOR,
USES A SPECIALLY DEVELOPED DESCRIPTOR LANGUAGE WITH LEXICAL UNITS THAT ARE (1)
STRUCTURAL FRAGMENTS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS AND (2) THOSE CHEMICAL BONDS WHICH
CHANGE DURING REACTIONS. THE PRECISION OF RETRIEVAL WAS INVESTIGATED AND FOUND
TO DECREASE WHEN THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE WAS NOT USED PROPERLY.
A WORKSHOP ON QUALITATIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, NOVEMBER 18-20, 1980.
     
WORK IN THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NON-INTERMEDIATED
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM LED TO CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEM OF
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL WHEN CONTROLLED VOCABULARY FAILS. DISCUSSION OF THAT
PROBLEM LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TYPOLOGY OF SUCH FAILURES AND TO AN
EXAMINATION OF METHODS OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEMS.
SPECIFICATION AND UNCONSTRAINED ENUMERATION OF CONFORMATIONS OF CHEMICAL
STRUCTURES FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION.
     
A SYMMETRY GROUP CALLED THE CONFORMATION SYMMETRY GROUP (CFSG) WHICH PROVIDES
A METHOD OF UNIQUELY SPECIFYING MOLECULAR CONFORMATION BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE
DISCRETE BOND PROPERTY (SUCH AS ROTAMERIC STATE) IS FORMULATED. THE METHOD IS
APPLICABLE TO ENTIRE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AS WELL AS SUBSTRUCTURES. THE CFSG
CAN BE USED TO BUILD A SIMPLE 'ACYCLIC' CONFORMATION GENERATOR AND LEADS TO A
SOLUTION FOR A HERETOFORE UNSOLVED PROBLEM IN CONFORMATION ENUMERATION.
STRUCTURE GENERATION ON THE BASIS OF BCT REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A METHOD OF STRUCTURE GENERATION BASED ON BCT (BLOCK-CUTPOINT TREE)
REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE GENERATION
PROGRAM IS A PART OF THE AUTOMATIC STRUCTURE ANALYSIS SYSTEM OF MASS SPECTRA
(ASASMAS) AND IS USED WHEN A SET OF THE INFERRED SUBSTRUCTURES ARE GIVEN AS
INPUT DATA. THE INPUT SUBSTRUCTURES ARE REPRESENTED BY MEANS OF BCT.
ALGORITHMIC GENERATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS INDEX NAMES. 1. GENERAL DESIGN.
     
THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) CHEMICAL REGISTRY SYSTEM IS A
COMPUTER-BASED CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES CHEMICAL
SUBSTANCES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. AN ALGORITHM HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED FOR COMPUTER GENERATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS (CA) INDEX NAMES FOR
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM REGISTRY STRUCTURE RECORDS. WHEN PROGRAMMED AND
INSTALLED IN THE CAS PRODUCTION SYSTEM, THE ALGORITHM WILL SUPPORT CA INDEX
PREPARATION BY GENERATING NAMES FOR A MAJORITY OF THE APPROXIMATELY 1400 NEW
STRUCTURES PROCESSED PER WORKING DAY AT CAS.
GRAPH POTENTIALS METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION FOR CHEMICAL INFORMATION
PROCESSING.
     
A GRAPH POTENTIALS METHOD FOR THE SOLUTION OF ISOMORPHISM AND AUTOMORPISM
PARTITIONING PROBLEMS IS PROPOSED. THE METHOD IS BASED ON AN ANALOGY BETWEEN
GRAPHS AND ELECTRICAL NETWORKS AND SERVES TO COMPUTE GRAPH INVARIANTS,
INCLUDING VERTEX POTENTIALS AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS AND TO PROVIDE AN
EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS. SOME COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATING
SENSITIVITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD ARE PRESENTED.
TOPOLOGICAL CENTRIC CODING AND NOMENCLATURE OF POLYCYCLIC HYDROCARBONS. 1.
CONDENSED BENZENOID SYSTEMS (POLYHEXES, FUSENES).
     
ON THE BASIS OF THE FOCAL NUMBERING OF EACH BENZENOID RING IN THE GRAPHITE
LATTICE, ANY POLYHEX (CATA-, PERI, AND CORONA-FUSED POLYCYCLIC BENZENOID
SYSTEM) CAN BE CODED BY MAKING USE OF (1) THE DUALIST GRAPH OF THE POLYHEX AND
(2) THE RECENT GENERALISATION OF THE TOPOLOGICAL CENTRE CONCEPT. THE NUMERICAL
CODE CAN BE USED FOR NOMENCLATURE PURPOSES, AND THE PRESENT APPROACH CAN BE
EASILY GENERALISED TO CONDENSED NONBENZENOID SYSTEMS AS WILL BE SHOWN IN
FUTURE PUBLICATIONS.
PIGGY IN THE MIDDLE: OBSERVATIONS ON THE ROLE OF THE INTERMEDIARY.
     
IT WAS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED BY SYSTEM DESIGNERS THAT ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SEARCH SYSTEMS, WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO
INFORMATION, WOULD BE INTERROGATED BY THE END USER. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
REVEALS HOWEVER, THAT CONTRARY TO SUCH EXPECTATIONS, MOST SEARCHES ARE STILL
BEING PERFORMED BY TRAINED INTERMEDIARIES. CLEARLY, THE ATTEMPT TO CONVERT
FORMER OFF-LINE BATCH SYSTEMS USED BY EITHER COMPUTER SCIENTISTS OR
INFORMATION SPECIALISTS, INTO ON-LINE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS FOR USE BY ALL HAS
NOT WORKED, DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF THEIR DESIGNERS TO HAVING DEVELOPED 'USER
FRIENDLY' SYSTEMS.
AN EXPERT SYSTEM AS AN ONLINE SEARCH INTERMEDIARY.
     
EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO ON-LINE SEARCH SYSTEMS
BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERT SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE USER
AND THE SEARCH SYSTEM. THE EXPERT SYSTEM WOULD SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A
HUMAN INTERMEDIARY.
MY WISH IS YOUR COMMAND??.
     
THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DATA BASES AND DATA BANK SUPPLIERS HAS BROUGHT WITH
IT THE PROBLEM THAT DIFFERENT HOST COMPUTERS MUST NORMALLY BE ACCESSED USING
DIFFERENT COMMAND LANGUAGES. MANY OF THESE LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONE
ANOTHER, BY VIRTUE OF COMMON ANCESTRY, COMMON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, ETC. EVEN SO,
THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY BY 2 SUPPLIERS. DIFFERENT
IMPLEMENTATIONS AND/OR LANGUAGES MUST BE CONSIDERED BY ON-LINE USERS BEFORE
CONTRACTING WITH A HOST. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEARNING A NEW COMMAND SET,
BUYING ADDITIONAL MANUALS, AND ATTENDING EXTRA COURSES ARE ALL ECONOMIC ONES,
AND ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN A DATA BASE IS OFFERED BY SEVERAL
SUPPLIERS.
WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.
     
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE USE OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE USER IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANY
DIVERSE USER INTERFACES. SEVERAL SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONE
WHICH IS REALLY OPEN AT PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO USE ALL BUT 1 OR 2 FAMILIAR
SYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT SOME POTENTIALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MISSED.
THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS BY SYSTEM OPERATORS
OR THE USE OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENT
TERMINAL, THIS LATTER ALTERNATIVE BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT MAY APPEAR,
AT 1ST SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORE
LESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI ON OF STANDARDS
WILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS IMPORTANT IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BE
REALISED.
CAFS 800' SOME PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES.
     
DESCRIBES THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CONTENTS ADDRESSABLE FILE STORE SYSTEM AND
THE ICL CAFS 800 SYSTEM, AND ITS APPLICABILITY TO TEXT RETRIEVAL AND DATA

ASLIB ONLINE SEARCH SERVICE: THE CONTINUING STORY.
     
AS ONE OF THE FEW ORGANISATIONS IN THE UK WHICH COULD DESCRIBE ITSELF AS A
GENERAL 'INFORMATION BROKER', ASLIB HAS BEEN PROVIDING AN ONLINE SEARCH
SERVICE FOR CORPORATE MEMBERS OF ASLIB SINCE SEPT 77. THE SERVICES, FOR WHICH
A CHARGE IS MADE, IS OPERATED WITHIN THE REFERRAL SERVICE PROVIDED BY ASLIB AT
NO CHARGE TO CORPORATE MEMBERS. VIEWS THE PRACTICALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE
OPERATION OF SUCH A SERVICE, CONSIDERING MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT, GUIDES AND
CONTRACTS; PRICING AND ALLOCATION OF COSTS; SECURITY AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS
SOME OF THE END-USER RELATED PROBLEMS SUCH AS EVALUATION OF SEARCH STRATEGY
AND RESULTS, AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY.
DIGITAL OPTICAL RECORDING, PRINCIPLES AND POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS.
     
DIGITAL OPTICAL RECORDING IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY BASED ON THE CAPABILITIES OF A
DIODE LASER TO MELT HOLES IN A TELLURIUM LAYER. 25,000 PAGES CAN BE WRITTEN
ONTO A DOR DISC. A SET OF DOR DISCS CAN FORM THE BACKBONE OF AN ELECTRONIC
DOCUMENT STORAGE SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE APPLIED IN VARIOUS ARCHIVAL APPLICATIONS.
DIGITAL HOMOGRAMS TO OFFSET AUTOMATED MICROFICHE ACCESS FOR A VERY LARGE
DATABANK' AN OUTLINE OF A PILOT PROJECT BY GRUNER AND JAHR PUBLISHING BASED ON
PHILIPS' DOR TECHNIQUE.
     
ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST AND TECHNICALLY MOST ADVANCED PRESS DATA BANKS IS
BEING RUN AS A BACK-UP SYSTEM FOR JOURNALISTS BY GRUNER0JAHR PUBLISHERS IN
HAMBURG. THE TEXT BANK ALONE NOW CONTAINS 1.3 MILLION PAGES OF FACSIMILE
TEXT,EACH OF WHICH CAN BE ELECTRONICALLY LOCATED AND RETRIEVED FROM AUTOMATED
MICROFICHE READER-PRINTERS. DAILY INPUT TO THE SYSTEM IS ABOUT 1,000 PAGES,
OUTPUT ABOUT 2,800. DIGITAL OPTICAL RECORDING (DOR) COULD FURTHER UPGRADE THE
PERFORMANCE OF THIS SYSTEM.
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
THE CENTRE DE RECHERCHE RETROSPECTIVE DE MARSEILLE HAS BEEN DEALING FOR 4
YEARS WITH ON-LINE SEARCHES ORIENTED TOWARDS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. NORTH
AFRICA HAS BEEN MAINLY CONCERNED, AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CENTRE BUILT UP IN
2 WAYS' BY DOING WORKS BY MAIL EXCHANGE, THE SEARCHES BEING CONDUCTED IN
MARSEILLE, OR BY GOING ON THE SPOT DEMONSTRATING AND HELPING PEOPLE TO DEVELOP
THEIR OWN ON-LINE CENTRE.
THE ONLINE INFORMATION SERVICE IN JICST AND THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
JAPANESE LANGUAGE' IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OF JAPANESE.
     
THE JAPAN INFORMATION CENTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (JICST) DEVELOPED THE
KANJI-KANA AUTOMATIC CONVERSION SYSTEM (K-KACS) AND THE JAPANESE KEYWORD
AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION SYSTEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING EASIER ACCESS TO JICST
FILES THROUGH KANA AND KANJI TERMINALS, AND COMPLEMENT THE CONTROLLED
VOCABULARY OF JICST THESAURUS. IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE NECESSITY OF DEVELOPING
THEESE SYSTEMS, THE CURRENT ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE IN JAPAN AND THE
PRESENT STATUS AND UTILISATION OF JICST FILES ARE ALSO MENTIONED. THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF JAPANESE SENTENCES ARE EXPLAINED BRIEFLY FROM THE VIEWPOINT
OF CONSTRUCTING THE 2 SYSTEMS.
UNITED NATIONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (UNBIS).
     
THE UNITED NATIONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (UNBIS) WAS DEVELOPED TO
PROVIDE EXPANDED REFERENCE AND INFORMATION SERVICES AT THE UNITED NATIONS DAG
HAMMARSKJOLD LIBRARY IN NEW YORK, AND TO ACHIEVE COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL OF UN DOCUMENTARY AND EXTERNALLY-ACQUIRED MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THE
UN'S PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS COMPUTER-BASED
INTEGRATED ON-LINE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM
COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS BY FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION, USE OF A VOCABULARY ALIGNED WITH
OTHER MAJOR INTERNATIONAL LISTS AND THESAURI, AND ACHIEVING A 1-TO-1 MATCH OF
DATA ELEMENTS WITH THOSE USED BY THE EXISTING INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS. CURRENT AND PROPOSED UNBIS ACTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED.
ON-LINE, NEW AID IN REFERENCE WORK, 2' COMPUTER SEARCHES FOR THE BUSINESS
WORLD.
     
EXAMINES ON-LINE SYSTEMS IN ENGLISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES ON THE BASIS OF VISITS IN
CONNECTION WITH A CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HELD
IN SEPT 81. LUTON CENTRAL LIBRARY HAS FOUND THAT AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE
SEARCH METHODS HAS INCREASED USE OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICE BY BUSINESSMEN AND
HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF IN PARTICULAR. HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY LIBRARY INSTALLED A
TERMINAL IN 1975 AND CARRIED OUT ON-LINE SEARCHES; AS A RESULT IT WAS ABLE TO
CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SOME REFERENCE WORKS. IN 1981 IT ACQUIRED AN SCL
MICROCOMPUTER FOR ACCESSION AND ISSUE CONTROL. BIRMINGHAM CENTRAL LIBRARY HAS
A TERMINAL IN THE TECHNICAL REFERENCE ROOM, WITH ACCESS BY ALL DEPARTMENTS,
BUT NOT THE PUBLIC. IT REGARDS THE ON-LINE SERVICE ONLY AS AN ADDITIONAL
REFERENCE TOOL. NONE OF THE LIBRARIES UNDERTOOK COMPUTER SEARCHES OF THEIR OWN
STOCK, BUT ONLY IN INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT SEARCH
EFFIC IENCY INCREASED IF USERS WERE INTERVIEWED FIRST, BUT NOT PRESENT DURING
THE ACTUAL SEARCH, AND THAT THOSE CARRYING OUT THE SEARCH SHOULD BE
EXPERIENCED REFERENCE LIBRARIANS SPECIALISING IN A PARTICULAR BASE. RAISES THE
QUESTION OF THE EFFECT ON PUBLICATION OF REFERENCE WORKS IN PAPER EDITIONS OF
THE GROWTH OF ON-LINE SEARCH FACILITIES. (FOR PART 1 2SEE BIBLIOTEK 70 1(17)
1981, 388-390).

PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE.
     
SINCE THE MID-60S COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN USED IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO FULFIL 2
MAIN FUNCTIONS; HOUSEKEEPING ROUTINES AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE ADVENT OF
ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING SERVICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 70S, AND VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS
AVAILABLE TOWARDS THE END OF THE 70S HAVE PROVIDED BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A
CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITIES.
FALKIRK DISTRICT LIBRARIES' ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROJECT, MARCH
1980-SEPTEMBER 1981.
     
REVIEWS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICES AT
FALKIRK DISTRICT LIBRARIES AS PART OF THE PHASE 2 BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT TO STUDY THE PROVISION OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SERVICES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

DISCUSSES THE WAY THAT UK UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ORGANISE ON-LINE INFORMATION
SERVICES AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REST OF THE LIBRARY, BASED ON A
QUESTIONNAIRE SENT TO SCONUL (STANDING CONFERENCE ON NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES) MEMBER LIBRARIES. OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH SERVICES,
EMPHASISING THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON'S CENTRAL INFORMATION
SERVICE, AND THE USE OF LIBRARY STAFF FOR SEARCHING. DESCRIBES PROBLEMS OF
FINANCE-ON-LINE 2VERSUS1 PRINT AND CHARGING THE USER. CONCLUDES THAT THE
MAJORITY OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ARE USING ON-LINE SERVICES, WHICH ARE SEEN AS
A LEGITIMATE PART OF THE LIBRARY'S ROLE. RESULTS OF THE SURVEY ARE APPENDED.
ONLINE SEARCHING IN BRITISH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
     
A SURVEY OF ON-LINE SEARCHING IN 14 UK UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES COVERING ASPECTS
OF THE ON-LINE SERVICES OFFERED; STARTING YEAR, CHARGING POLICY, USERS AND THE
ON-LINE EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING OF THE INTERMEDIARIES. ON-LINE LITERATURE
HOLDINGS AND USE ARE DISCUSSED. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF SEARCHES IS GIVEN;
COMMANDS AND OPERATORS USED, THEIR AVERAGE USE PER SEARCH AND COMMANDS NEVER
USED.
PATENT INFORMATION ONLINE' A REVIEW.
     
PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT AND UNDER-RATED SOURCE OF INFORMATION. SOME OF THE
FEATURES WHICH MAKE PATENT DATA BASES UNIQUE ARE DESCRIBED. SOME CRITERIA FOR
THE EVALUATION OF ON-LINE PATENTS DATA BASES ARE THEN DISCUSSED, AND THE MAJOR
DATA BASES ARE EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THESE CRITERIA. THE LIKELY IMPACT OF
OPTICAL DISCS ON PATENTS INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS DISCUSSED, AND THIS IS
FOLLOWED BY SOME PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF PATENTS INFORMATION ON-LINE.
STRUCTURE INPUT DESIGN FOR AN ONLINE SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM.
     
2 METHODS OF STRUCTURE INPUT IN CAS ONLINE ARE DESCRIBED, GRAPHICS STRUCTURE
INPUT AND TEXT STRUCTURE INPUT. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF EACH TYPE OF INPUT. THE
USE OF THESE INPUT METHODS IN CAS ONLINE IS DISCUSSED.
COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF INFORMATION RESOURCES FOR CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
SEARCHING: A COLLABORATIVE STUDY.
     
A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT TO COMPARE AND EVALUATE INFORMATION RESOURCES IN
CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY 14 EUROPEAN ORGANISATIONS. THE
METHODOLOGY INVOLVED INDEPENDENT SEARCHING OF 'TEST QUERIES', WITH SUBSEQUENT
EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF RESULTS AND FAILURE ANALYSIS. A SUMMARY OF THOSE
FINDINGS OF DIRECT RELEVANCE TO ON-LINE SEARCHING IS PRESENTED.
CHARGING FOR ONLINE RETRIEVAL SERVICES.
     
ATTEMPTS TO SET OUT THE DILEMMA MANY LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION OFFICERS FIND
THEMSELVES IN, AS TO WHETHER ON-LINE SERVICES SHOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE
END-USER, OR SEEN AS A CHARGE UPON THE LIBRARY. IN THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE
THE USER HAS TO PAY, VERY MANY VARIATIONS EXIST IN TERMS OF WHICH ELEMENTS OF
THE TOTAL COST ARE CHARGED BACK. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN. THE PAPER STRESSES THE
DESIRABILITY OF FORMULATING SOME RATIONAL SCHEME FOR BRINGING CHARGING
POLICIES INTO LINE, OFFERS NO SOLUTIONS, BUT INVITES COOPERATIVE DISCUSSION OF
THE SITUATION.
THE INTEGRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN
INDUSTRY.
     
RELATING TO THE TOTAL COSTS OF AN INFORMATION SERVICE, 3 EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN TO
ILLUSTRATE HOW TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES WITHIN AN ORGANISATION. THE
1ST EXAMPLE CONSIDERS THE BALANCE BETWEEN SETTING UP INHOUSE ON-LINE
INFORMATION SERVICES AND BUYING IN SERVICES FROM ON-LINE VENDORS. THE 2ND
DISCUSSES ADMINISTRATIVE WAYS OF USING PUBLIC ON-LINE SERVICES COST
EFFECTIVELY IN AN ORGANISATION THAT USES MANY HOSTS AND MANY PASSWORDS. THE
FINAL EXAMPLE SUGGESTS THE ADVANTAGES OF A SHARED APPROACH TO ON-LINE VENDORS
TO MEET COMMON NEEDS.
ON THE INTEGRATION OF DATA-, TEXT- AND FACSIMILE COMMUNICATION IN LIBRARIES.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNIQUES IN THE FIELD OF COMMUNICATION AND STORAGE IS
A CHALLENGE FOR LIBRARIES. IN SOME FIELDS THESE TECHNIQUES ARE ALREADY IN USE;
JOINT CATALOGUING WITH ON-LINE CONNECTION TO A DATA BANK, INFORMATION TRANSFER
BY ACCESS TO DATA BASES, USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA FOR ORIENTATION AND USER
TRAINING. OTHER USES INCLUDE VIEWDATA, TELECOPIER, TEXT PROCESSING MACHINES
AND THE STORAGE OF MASS PICTURES AND TEXTS ON VIDEO DISCS INSTEAD OF
MICROFILM.

THESE HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED.
TELECOMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, NETWORKING AND LIBRARIES' PROCEEDINGS OF A
CONFERENCE HELD AT GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND ON JUNE 3, 1977.
     
THE CONFERENCE PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT AND DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES FOR
DIGITAL TRANSMISSION OF IMAGE DATA THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE
OPERATIONS OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES OR PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR
INFORMATION NETWORKING. TECHNOLOGIES REVIEWED INCLUDE SLOW-SCAN TELEVISION,
TELECONFERENCING, AND VIDEODISCS. OTHER PAPERS DISCUSS TECHNOLOGY AND
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT FOR COMPUTER NETWORK INTERCONNECTION THROUGH HARDWARE
AND SOFTWARE, PARTICULARLY PACKET-SWITCHED NETWORKS; COMPUTER NETWORK
PROTOCOLS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE APPLICATIONS; THE STRUCTURE OF A
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK; AND THE MAJOR POLICY ISSUES
INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OR DEREGULATION OF THE COMMON COMMUNICATIONS
CARRIERS INDUSTRY.
PRIVATE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS AND GATEWAY LINK TO PUBLIC SERVICES.
     
PRIVATE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS FOR CORPORATE IN-HOUSE USE, AND FOR CLOSED USER
GROUPS, ARE ATTRACTING INCREASING ATTENTION. AT THE SAME TIME, ADVANCES ARE
OCCURRING IN THE FIELD OF PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE VIDEOTEX NETWORK DESIGN, WHERE
THE TREND IS TOWARDS CONNECTING INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL COMPUTERS INTO PUBLIC
PACKET NETWORKS FOR ACCESS BY VIDEOTEX SUBSCRIBERS THROUGH GATEWAY LINKS IN
THE NETWORK. IN THE FUTURE, THERE WILL BE A CONVERGENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE
VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS FOR CORPORATE USE, AND EXTERNAL COMPUTERS CONNECTED TO PUBLIC
VIDEOTEX NETWORKS.
PRIVATE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS AND ACCESS VIA PUBLIC SERVICES.
     
WHILE THE INITIAL CONCEPT OF VIDEOTEX WAS THAT OF A HOME INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SERVICE, IN PRACTICE VIDEOTEX SERVICES ARE OF MUCH INTEREST TO BUSINESS USERS.
PRIVATE VIDEOTEX SYSTEMS ARE BEING INTRODUCED TO COMPLEMENT PUBLIC SERVICES.
THEY MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS-ON DEDICATED COMPUTERS
ACCESSED VIA THE PUBLIC TELEPHONE OR DATA NETWORKS, OR VIA A GATEWAY FACILITY
ON A PUBLIC SERVICE. EXAMINES THESE APPROACHES, AND IN PARTICULAR THEIR
RELATIVE COSTS.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
LEGIBILITY ASPECTS OF CODED ONLINE INFORMATION.
     
ON-LINE SERVICES PROVIDE HIGHLY STRUCTURED MATERIAL, LIKE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION, BUT NORMALLY NO SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPOGRAPHICAL LAYOUT. THE
INCREASING USE OF TEXTUAL DATA BASES MAKES IT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE SOME
GENERALISED CODES INTO THE TEXT. THESE FLAGS ARE NEEDED TO ASSIST THE OUTPUT
DEVICE IN PRESENTING THE MATERIAL IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY ACCORDING TO THE
ACCEPTED RULES OF LEGIBILITY RESEARCH. THIS CODING SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR
DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAY EQUIPMENT. MODERN LEGIBILITY RESEARCH COVERING
TYPOGRAPHY, LAYOUT, COLOUR USAGE AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF READING IS BEGINNING
TO SUPPLY THE TOOLS WHICH HELP TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TEXT IS MORE THAN STRINGS
OF CHARACTERS SUITABLE FOR VISUAL PERCEPTION IN A GIVEN SEQUENCE.
INTELLIGENCE IN THE USER'S TERMINAL' A LOOK AT CURRENT OPTIONS AND
POSSIBILITIES.
     
MANY ORGANISATIONS ARE NOW REPLACING, OR SUPPLEMENTING, THEIR ORIGINAL

A PROPOSAL FOR A NETWORK COMPUTER FOR ONLINE ASSISTANCE.
     
RECENT RESEARCH WORK ON BOTH MICROCOMPUTERS AND MAINFRAME MACHINES HAS SHOWN
THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE USER OUTSIDE THE HOST COMPUTER.
THE US MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS HAVE CONCENTRATED ON LARGE SCALE SYSTEMS WITH
EXTENSIVE TUTORIAL FACILITIES, SUCH AS THE 01 SAM SYSTEM OFFERED BY THE
FRANKLIN INSTITUTE, OR FORMAT TRANSFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR MOVING DATA FROM ONE
SYSTEM TO ANOTHER AS PROVIDED BY THE CAST SYSTEM MARKETED BY THE COMPUTER
CORPORATION OF AMERICA. THE UK SYSTEM, USERKIT, IS A CHEAPER TERMINAL
ATTACHMENT WHICH SIMPLIFIES LOGON BY PERMANENTLY STORED MESSAGES, REDUCES
SEARCH COSTS BY PRE-FORMULATION OF SEARCH STATEMENTS AND PROVIDES OUTPUT
SELECTION AND RE-TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.

ON-LINE SEARCHING WITHOUT INCURRING HIGH CONNECT COSTS. THE EMULATION WORKS ON
A DATA BASE OF AROUND 100 RECORDS INCLUDING AUTHOR, TITLE, JOURNAL, LANGUAGE,
ABSTRACT AND DESCRIPTOR FIELDS. THE MAIN LOCKHEED DIALOG COMMANDS ARE EMULATED
INCLUDING FULL TEXT SEARCHING AND TRUNCATION AS WELL AS SELECT, COMBINE, TYPE,
ETC. IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO INCLUDE DIAGNOSTICS IN THE PACKAGE, ENABLING THE
SEARCHER TO SOLICIT HELP FROM THE SYSTEM IF IT IS FELT THAT THE SEARCH IS
BECOMING UNSTRUCTURED OR FAILING IN INTENT. THE PROGRAMME WILL ALSO INTERRUPT
THE SEARCH TO ISSUE WARNINGS IF AN ADEQUATE SEARCH STRATEGY DOES NOT APPEAR TO
BE DEVELOPING. AS PART OF THE PACKAGE A SECONDARY PROGRAMME WILL FACILITATE
THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC CREATION OF ADDITIONAL MICRODATA BASES.
THE ROLE OF AN INTERMEDIARY IN A UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT.
     
AT THE FRANKFURT CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT A RESEARCH PROJECT IS UNDER WAY
CONCERNED WITH TESTING AND EVALUATING INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SERVICES AS WELL
AS USER EDUCATION. THE MAIN ACTIVITIES ARE' 1) DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A
REFERRAL SYSTEM, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A BASIS FOR THE DECISION ON THE USE OF
DOCUMENT DELIVERY OR INFORMATION SERVICES FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS. 2)

RESEARCHER IN THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING ARE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED
WITH THE DATA BASES AND DATA BASE SERVICES OFFERED BY NASA.
SOME FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF HOST SYSTEMS.
     
CHOOSING A SUITABLE ON-LINE HOST SYSTEM IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX
PROCEDURE. A SET OF CRITERIA IS SUGGESTED AS A FRAMEWORK TO HELP IN DECISION
MAKING. THE IMPORTANCE OF IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE USER IS
STRESSED AND THE MATCHING OF THESE REQUIREMENTS TO CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS
RANGE OF DATA BASES OFFERED, COMMAND LANGUAGE, METHODS OF ACCESS AS WELL AS
ECONOMICS AND QUALITY OF SERVICE IS EXAMINED.
NUMERIC DATABASES: TOO MANY OR NOT ENOUGH STATISTICAL DATA?.
     
HISTORICALLY THE 1ST NUMERICAL DATA BASES WERE ORGANISED TO MEET A SPECIFIC
DEMAND BY SUPPLYING ECONOMISTS WITH BASIC STATISTICAL DATA TOGETHER WITH
COMPUTERISED TOOLS IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THE RETRIEVAL DATA. DATA WERE
GATHERED FROM ANY STANDARD OR READILY-AVAILABLE SOURCE. SOME VERY USABLE DATA
BASES WERE SOLD BY THEIR PRODUCERS TO BE OFFERED TO ON-LINE SEARCHERS. MANY
DATA BASES DISPLAY STRONG SIMILARITIES, OFFERING THE SAME INFORMATION, WHILE
IN OTHER FIELDS, FOR MANY COUNTRIES, INFORMATION IS SCARCE IF AT ALL
AVAILABLE.

THE PERFORMANCE OF 17 BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES AT RETRIEVING NON-CLASSIFIED
DEFENCE LITERATURE. THE NEED FOR A NEW DEFENCE DATA BASE IS DISCUSSED.
FORCES FOR CHANGE IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC BUSINESS DATABASES.
     
THE ON-LINE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED RAPID GROWTH IN THE PAST DECADE, AND THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY BUSINESS FILES ARE EMERGING AS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AREAS
OF THE INDUSTRY. A NUMBER OF TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE IDENTIFIED, AND THEIR
EFFECTS ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC BUSINESS DATA BASES ARE ANALYSED. A KEY TREND IS THAT
OF THE AVAILABILITY OF MORE FULL-TEXT DATA BASES. IN THE NEXT 3-5 YEARS
'HYBRID FILES' CONSISTING OF INDEXING, ABSTRACTS, AND THE FULL TEXTS OF
DOCUMENTS WILL EMERGE AS A DESIRABLE STRUCTURE FOR NEW BIBLIOGRAPHIC BUSINESS
DATA BASES.
SUMMARY OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEMS.
     
REVIEWS CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCHING BRIEFLY, WITH A TABLE OF
FEATURES HIGHLIGHTING THE 5 COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS PROVIDED.
THE DARC SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM A SEARCHER'S EXPERIENCE.
     
THE SEARCH QUESTIONS OF THE CHEMIST OFTEN RELATE TO A CLASS OF SUBSTANCES
(I.E. HE DESIRES INFORMATION ON ALL INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS WHICH HAVE PARTICULAR
PARTIAL STRUCTURES IN COMMON). IN DARC, AN EFFECTIVE SEARCH PROGRAMME IS
AVAILABLE WHICH ALLOWS THESE COMPOUNDS TO BE SOUGHT OUT FROM A VERY LARGE FUND
OF STRUCTURES (4.5 MILLION) AND THE STRUCTURE DIAGRAM OF EACH COMPOUND WITH
THE ASSOCIATED REGISTRY NUMBER TO BE REPRESENTED ON THE SCREEN OF A GRAPHIC
DISPLAY TERMINAL. IT IS POSSIBLE, IN ADDITION, TO USE THE RESULT OF THIS
SEARCH, IN THE FORM OF A LIST OF REGISTRY NUMBERS, AS SEARCH PARAMETERS IN A
BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE, IF NECESSARY IN COMBINATION WITH NON-STRUCTURAL
INFORMATION.
ICI'S EXPERIENCES WITH CROSSBOW.
     
THE CROSSBOW SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN REGULAR USE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND HAS PROVED
AN EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF HANDLING CHEMICAL STRUCTURE INFORMATION
IN VERY LARGE FILES. AT ICI IT IS USED WITH AN INTEGRATED CHEMICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL DATA BASE AS WELL AS ON EXTERNAL WLN-BASED FILES. SOME SALIENT
FEATURES OF CROSSBOW ARE BRIEFLY ASSESSED.
SEARCHES FOR POLYMERS IN THE BASIC FILES DERIVED FROM THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS
SERVICE CHEMICAL REGISTRY SYSTEM.
     
THE METHODS USED FOR SEARCHING THE BASIC SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM FOR
POLYMERS CONTAINING SPECIFIEC MONOMERS ARE DESCRIBED. THE BASIC FILES ARE
BASED ON CAS REGISTRY AND REG/CAN DATA. THE SEARCHES YIELD REGISTRY NUMBERS
WHICH ARE THEN USED TO RETRIEVE CA ABSTRACT NUMBERS.
USE OF JOIS AT TOKYO WOMEN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE LIBRARY.
     
SINCE THE COMPUTERISED RETRIEVAL SERVICE, JOIS, WAS MADE AVAILABLE AT TOKYO
WOMEN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE IN APR 79, THE NUMBER OF LITERATURE RETRIEVAL REQUESTS
INCREASED BY MORE THAN 100%. HOWEVER, MANUAL LITERATURE SEARCHES USING
JAPANESE INDEXING JOURNALS ARE STILL BEING CONTINUED FOR 2 REASONS' (1)
ON-LINE DATA BASES INCLUDED IN JOIS ONLY COVER THE LAST 5 YEARS OF LITERATURE;
(2) JAPANESE LITERATURE IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED. OF THE DATA BASES AVAILABLE
ON JOIS, MEDLARS WAS USED THE MOST, FOLLOWED BY TOXLINE. THE AVERAGE SEARCH
TIME WAS 7 MINUTES FOR ALL DATA BASES. 3 MEDLARS SEARCH SAMPLES ARE SHOWN.
THE VALUE OF CONTROLLED INDEXING SYSTEMS IN ONLINE TEXT DATABASES.
     
WHILE THE VALUE OF CONTROLLED INDEXING TO SUPPLEMENT TEXT SEARCHING IS
RECOGNISED IN LIMITED TEXT (E.G. BIBLIOGRAPHIC) DATA BASES, TEXT SEARCHING IS
USUALLY THOUGHT TO GIVE SUFFICIENT SUBJECT ACCESS TO FULL TEXT DATA BASES.
ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM INFORMATION SCIENCE, COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND LINGUISTICS
ARE PUT FORWARD IN FAVOUR OF USING SOME FORM OF CONTROLLED LANGUAGE IN FULL
TEXT DATA BASES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A SYSTEM IN MARTINDEX, A FULL TEXT
DRUG INFORMATION DATA BANK, IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
IN SUBJECT ACCESS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
A DISTRIBUTED DATA ENTRY NETWORK FOR DATABASE PRODUCERS.
     
HAVING ENTRIES FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE PREPARED AT WIDELY SEPARATED
UNITS PRESENTS PROBLEMS OF LOGISTICS, COMMUNICATION, STANDARDISATION, CONTROL
AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS. CAB IS OVERCOMING THESE BY IMPLEMENTING THE
FORMATEXT-11 SOFTWARE PACKAGE ON A STAR NETWORK OF MINICOMPUTERS (PDP 11) AT
15 CENTRES IN THE UK. THE 1ST INSTALLATION OF THE NEW SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY
DEMONSTRATED ITS POTENTIAL FOR FAST, ACCURATE INPUT AT LOW COST. SPECIALLY
DESIGNED FOR PROCESSING STRUCTURED ALPHANUMERIC DATA, FORMATEXT-11 HAS
FACILITIES FOR FORMS DESIGN, AUTHORITY FILE DEFINITION AND MAINTENANCE,
CHARACTER SET DEFINITION, SOURCE TEXT ENTRY, PROOF PRINTING, RELEASING AND
DATA COMMUNICATIONS. THE EASE WITH WHICH THE 1ST 3 OF THESE FACILITIES CAN BE
MODIFIED MAKES FORMATEXT-11 A UNIQUELY FLEXIBLE TOOL FOR PRODUCERS OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES, DIRECTORIES, ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND DICTIONARIES.
DIRECTORY OF SELECTED FORESTRY-RELATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES.
     
THE COMPILATION LISTS 117 BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES MAINTAINED BY SCIENTISTS OF
THE FOREST SERVICE, US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. FOR EACH DATA BASE, THE
FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED' NAME OF THE DATA BASE; ORIGINATOR; DATA
STARTED; COVERAGE BY SUBJECT, GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AND SIZE OF COLLECTION; BASE
FORMAT AND AVAILABILITY.
COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN SEARCHING FOR METALLURGICAL INFORMATION.
     
A COMPARISON HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DIFFERENT DATA BASES IN SEARCHING FOR
METALLURGICAL INFORMATION IN 4 SYSTEMS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE'
ESA-QUEST, LOCKHEED-DIALOG, INKA-GRIPS AND THERMODATA. A FEW DIFFERENT SEARCH
PROFILES WERE PREPARED IN ORDER TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE DIFFERENT
SYSTEMS. THE ANALYSIS OF SEARCH COSTS WAS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY. AN OUTLINE
WAS GIVEN OF FACILITIES FOR GETTING THE DOCUMENTS. THE USEFULNESS OF THE
INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS CHECKED BY INTERVIEWING THE
CUSTOMERS. THE UTILITY OF THE NEW FACTUAL DATA BANK INCLUDED IN THE THERMODATA
SYSTEM WAS EMPHASISED.
A LOW-COST SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING MACHINE-READABLE ABSTRACTS.
     
DESCRIBES GEO SYSTEMS' PURPOSE BUILT SYSTEM CENTRED ON A WORD PROCESSOR AND
DESIGNED TO ALLOW INPUT FROM DISTANT STATIONS AND OUTPUT OF BOTH CAMERA-READY
COPY AND STANDARD COMPUTER TAPES FOR INDEXES AND RETRIEVAL PURPOSES. THE
EMPHASIS IS ON A RELATIVELY CHEAP AND SIMPLE SYSTEM, AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT
THE TOTAL COST WILL ADD NO MORE THAN 2.5% TO THE COST OF EACH ABSTRACT.
WHAT LIBRARIANS HAVE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT REMARC AND WERE NOT AFRAID TO ASK.
     
CARROLLTON PRESS, INC., IS CREATING A NEW DATA BASE (REMARC) FROM AN ESTIMATED
5.2 MILLION NON-MARC LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (LC) CATALOGUE RECORDS. ANSWERS SOME
QUESTIONS PUT BY LIBRARIANS CONCERNING ACQUISITION OF REMARC RECORDS,
RELATIONSHIP OF THE RECORDS WITH LC FILES, COSTS, AND WHY CARROLLTON EMBARKED
ON THE REMARC DATABASE PROJECT.
THE PROBLEM OF EXPRESSING INFORMATION NEED IN A USER'S INQUIRY TO AN AUTOMATIC
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
ANALYSES THE DRAWBACKS OF THE TRADITIONAL COMPOSITION OF A THEMATIC INQUIRY IN
AN AUTOMATIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR AN
ADEQUATE REFLECTION OF THE SPECIALIST'S INFORMATION NEEDS IN AN INQUIRY. SHOWS
THAT THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS RETRIEVED BY THE SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO A
TRADITIONALLY-COMPOSED INQUIRY ARE NOT NECESSARILY PERTINENT, SINCE THE
CRITERIA EMPLOYED BY THE USER WHEN ANALYSING AND EVALUATING DOCUMENTS ARE NOT
INCLUDED IN THE INQUIRY TEXT AS RETRIEVAL CHARACTERISTICS. INTRODUCES THE
CONCEPTS OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION NEEDS AND 'RETRIEVAL
INFORMATION NEED'. CONSIDERS THE PROBLEM OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPOSITION OF
PERTINENCE CRITERIA AND THEIR FORMULATION IN AN INQUIRY. PROPOSES THE
CLASSIFICATION OF PERTINENCE CRITERIA.
FACTORS AFFECTING DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS' PRESENT AND FUTURE.
     
THE PAPER EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY AND ANALYSES THE
FACTORS INVOLVED IN SOME EXISTING NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SERVICES. IT
SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS STUDIED SO FAR ARE NOT THOSE WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT,
AND FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION AND
MISCONCEPTIONS SURROUNDING DEBATE ON DOCUMENT DELIVERY. SOME FACTORS ARE
PROPOSED FOR EXAMINATION WHICH ARE MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DESIGN OF DOCUMENT
DELIVERY SYSTEMS.
THE MARKET FOR DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICES.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DISTRIBUTED TO LIBRARIANS, INFORMATION OFFICERS AND USERS
OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR A DOCUMENT
DELIVERY SERVICE USING NEW TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD HELP SPEED THE FLOW OF
PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS TO THE USER. RESULTS ARE REPORTED.
THE CEC PLANS FOR ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY.
     
OUTLINES A PROPOSED COMMUNITY PLAN FOR ACTION IN THE FIELD OF ELECTRONIC
PUBLISHING AND DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS. THE PLAN WAS PREPARED TOGETHER WITH THE
DOCUMENT DELIVERY TASK FORCE OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (CIDST) WHICH ADVISES THE COMMISSION
ON IDST MATTERS. THE ACTION PROGRAMME CONCENTRATES ON A NUMBER OF PILOT
EXPERIMENTS COVERING THE WHOLE CHAIN OF FUNCTIONS FROM DOCUMENT ORDERING TO
THE DELIVERY ON THE USER'S DESK. EXPERIMENTS WILL ALSO INCLUDE SATELLITE
COMMUNICATION TESTS, AND THEY WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY A NUMBER OF STUDIES,
SOME OF THEM DEALING WITH NON-TECHNICAL ISSUES SUCH AS COPYRIGHT.
ONLINE DOCUMENT ORDERING SYSTEMS OF ONLINE VENDORS (ABSTRACT ONLY).
     
THE NUMBER OF ON-LINE DATA BASE VENDORS PROVIDING DOCUMENT ORDERING SERVICES
HAS INCREASED SINCE 1972, WHEN THIS SERVICE WAS OFFERED FOR THE 1ST TIME.
ORDERING DOCUMENTS ON-LINE FOLLOWING AN ON-LINE SEARCH WOULD SEEM TO BE AN
ATTRACTIVE POSSIBILITY. HOWEVER, ACTUAL USE OF THIS SYSTEM FACILITY IS
SURPRISINGLY LOW. GIVES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SELECTED ON-LINE DOCUMENT
ORDERING SYSTEMS. SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS EASE-OF-USE, TURN-AROUND
TIME, TYPES OF SUPPLIERS AND CHARGES ARE OUTLINED. DATA ELEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED
AND CONSIDERATIONS OF VARIOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ARE EMPHASISED.

NETWORKING.
     
THIS TECHNICAL REPORT COVERING A 12-MONTH PERIOD (JULY '80-JUNE '81) DESCRIBES
THE DESIGN OF THE MAILPHONE. THE INTENT OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SHOW THAT NEW
APPROACHES TO MAN-COMPUTER INTERFACE DESIGN CAN OVERCOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERUTILISATION OF MILITARY COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE
MILITARY COMPUTER SYSTEM SELECTED FOR IMPROVEMENT WAS THE ARPANET ELECTRONIC
MAIL SYSTEM. THE MMR IMPROVEMENTS WERE REALISED BY A COMPLETE REDESIGN OF THE
ELECTRONIC MAIL INTERFACE, AND DEMONSTRATED BY THE MAILPHONE, A
MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SYSTEM FEATURING A DESK TOP UNIT PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO
RESEMBLE THE FAMILIAR TELEPHONE. THE MAILPHONE, WHILE COMPLEX TECHNOLOGICALLY,

ADDRESSES OF MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS. A GLOSSARY OF TERMS IS INCLUDED.
THE FEDERAL SIDE OF TRADITIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COST ALLOCATIONS.
     
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS BEFORE THE 96TH CONGRESS, THE
STRUCTURE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS BEING DEBATED IN NUMEROUS
REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, COURT CASES, ETC. CENTRAL TO THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE
'PROPER COSTS' AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS NOT ONLY TO PRICES BUT ALSO TO OTHER
BENEFITS OR BURDENS. COSTS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE TRADITIONAL
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY MAINLY BY A 2-STAGE PROCESS. 1ST, EXPLICIT
JURISDICTIONAL SEPARATIONS HAVE ALLOCATED COSTS HENCE REVENUE REQUIREMENTS
AMONG THE FEDERAL AND ALL THE STATE JURISDICTIONS. 2ND, PRICING RATHER THAN
COSTING POLICY HAS DETERMINED THE FURTHER INCIDENCE OF BENEFITS AND BURDENS IN
THE GENERAL ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT SUBALLOCATIONS OF COSTS WITHIN THE POOLS OF
COSTS ASSIGNED TO THE BROAD AGGREGATES OF INTERSTATE AND STATE SERVICES.
THE AUTOMATED OFFICE: ONLINE ACCESS IN A RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
     
DURING THE INTRODUCTION OF WORD-PROCESSING EQUIPMENT THE PROBLEM OF INDEXING
AND RETRIEVING THE PROCESSED DOCUMENTS AROSE. THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
ALLOWS THE ON-LINE INDEXING OF RECORDS, WHILE THE THESAURUS CAN BE CONSULTED
ON-LINE AS WELL. SECRETARIES ARE ABLE TO CREATE THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTAL
THESAURUS BY SELECTING THE RELEVANT TERMS FROM THE CORPORATE THESAURUS.
BOOKS AND PEOPLE: THE DESIRABILITY OF COORDINATED RESEARCH.
     
RESEARCH INTO REASONS WHY CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION MAKE LITTLE USE
OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE PLANNING OF
LIBRARY POLICY. IN THE PAST TOO MUCH RESEARCH INTO LIBRARY USE HAS SERVED ONLY
TO CONFIRM WHAT WAS ALREADY SUSPECTED, THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS BELONG MAINLY
TO THE HIGHER INCOME AND BETTER EDUCATED SECTIONS OF SOCIETY. IN THE
NETHERLANDS THE BUREAU VOOR DE COLLECTIEVE PROPAGANDA VAN HET NEDERLANDSE BOEK
(OFFICE FOR THE JOINT PROMOTION OF DUTCH BOOKS) HAS DESIGNATED A 'BOOK OF THE
MONTH' AS A SPECIAL OFFER EACH MONTH SINCE 1970. A NEW ORGANISATION SHOULD BE
CREATED IN THE NETHERLANDS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PUBLISHING HOUSES,
ALL SECTIONS OF THE LIBRARY WORLD AND FROM GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO
INVESTIGATE WAYS OF STIMULATING, COORDINATING AND SUBSIDISING THE NATION'S
READING HABITS.

ANALYSES THE TERM BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE LIGHT OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE STANDARD
2BIBLIOGRAPHY' TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 1(GOST 16448-70 AND GOST 7.0-77).
BIBLIOGRAPHY IS DEFINED THROUGH THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF ACTIVITY. THE IMPACT ON
THE EDUCATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHERS OF THE APPROACH TO BIBLIOGRAPHY AS AN ACTIVITY
IS CONSIDERED IN DETAIL. FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
ACTIVITY ARE SEEN AS CONSISTING OF INNER AND OUTER STRUCTURES. THE WORK OF THE
BIBLIOGRAPHER IS EXAMINED IN ALL ITS STAGES AND RELATED TO THE INNER
FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE OUTER STRUCTURE FULLY REFLECTS THE
INNER ONE.
BOUNDARIES OF THE STATE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE USSR.
     
REVIEWS ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SOVIET STATE BIBLIOGRAPHY SINCE ITS BEGINNINGS IN
THE 1920S UNTIL THE PRESENT. GUIDANCE FOR THE ORGANISATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHY WAS
PROVIDED BY THE DECREE ON BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK ISSUED IN 1920. BY THE END OF
1930S ALMOST ALL SOVIET REPUBLICS HAD ESTABLISHED THEIR KNIZHNAYA PALATA (BOOK
CHAMBER)-AN INSTITUTE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REGISTRATION (BOTH
CURRENT AND RETROSPECTIVE) OF PUBLICATIONS PUT OUT WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF
INDIVIDUAL REPUBLICS. THE FUNCTION OF THE COORDINATOR OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK
ON THE ALL-UNION LEVEL IS CARRIED OUT BY THE VSESOYUZNAYA KNIZHNAYA PALATA
(ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER) WHOSE PAST AND PRESENT WORK IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL.
STATE BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE 11TH FIVE YEAR PLAN.
     
AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL OF IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION, BIBLIOGRAPHY WILL HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SOLUTION OF CONCRETE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

THE CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN AND CENSORSHIP: ANOTHER VIEW.

A REPLY TO 'LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY AND CENSORSHIP' THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN', CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN (5) 1981, 29-38 (SEE PREVIOUS
ABSTRACT). RAISES THE FOLLOWING POINTS' THE SECURE BELIEVER CAN MAKE A
DISCRIMINATING JUDGEMENT IN SELECTING MATERIALS, UTILIZING ALL THE MEANS AT
HIS DISPOSAL, EVEN IF IT MEANS INCLUDING THINGS HE STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH;
LIBRARIANS MUST BE ALERT TO THE POWER OF EVIL, BUT TO CONCEAL IT IS NOT TO
DESTROY IT; THE LIBRARIAN SPENDS PUBLIC MONEY, GENERATED FROM PEOPLE OF MANY
FAITHS, WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL AND MORAL BACKGROUNDS; LIBRARIANS NEED TO BE,
AND TO BE SEEN AS, OPEN PERSONS WHO ARE CONSISTENTLY GRAPPLING WITH THE ISSUES
OF REAL LIFE AS THEY ARE REFLECTED BROADLY IN THE PUBLISHING WORLD; AND
FINALLY, LIBRARIANS SHOULD BEA LIFE-ENHANCING AND A LIFE-AFFIRMING INFLUENCE
AND THE LIBRARY CAN BE A GENUINE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS WHERE 'GOOD' BOOKS MAY
COMPETE WITH THE BAD SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE TOGETHER.
A CONVERSATION WITH JUDITH F. KRUG.

IN AN INTERVIEW JUDITH F. KRUG, DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S
OFFICE FOR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM (OIF), DISCUSSES THE RISE IN CENSORSHIP OF
LIBRARY MATERIALS SINCE THE ELECTION OF RONALD REAGAN TO THE US PRESIDENCY
WHICH MUST BE RESISTED BY LIBRARIANS. DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE OIF AND
CONCLUDES WITH RESUME OF KRUG'S CAREER.

EXAMINES THE NOTION OF 'INFORMATION MAN' BY ANALOGY WITH 'ECONOMIC MAN' AND
SEEKS TO DISCOVER HOW THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN USED IMPLICITLY IN USER STUDIES AND
BIBLIOMETRICS. THE CONCLUSION IS REACHED THAT A PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF
INFORMATION MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN SUCH STUDIES AND THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE
EXAMINED. MORE SOPHISTICATED VERSIONS OF INFORMATION MAN ARE SEEN TO BE
EMERGING FROM SOME RECENT WORK.
INFORMATION BANKS, DATA BANKS, AND DATA BASES' AN ATTEMPT AT CLARIFICATION OF
TERMS.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 CANADIAN CONFERENCE WHICH DERIVES A STRUCTURAL
TYPOLOGY FOR INFORMATION BANKS FROM THE PRELIMINARY CONSTRUCTION OF TYPOLOGIES
OF DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTARY ELEMENTS. THE 1ST TYPOLOGY DEVELOPS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION; THE 2ND
LEADS TO REDEFINITION OF THE CONCEPTS OF RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ENTRIES. THE CREATION OF THE INFORMATION BANK TYPOLOGY LEADS
TO EXPLANATION OF THE DATA BASE CONCEPT, AND IN CONCLUSION A DEFINITION OF
DOCUMENTATION IS ADVANCED. THE ARGUMENT IS ILLUSTRATED BY REFERENCE TO
CANADIAN EXAMPLES.
THE STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION.

REMARKS BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO A
MEMBERSHIP MEETING 28 JUNE 81 AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO.
CONSIDERS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION, EMPHASISING ITS FINANCIAL
SITUATION, INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MASS MEDIA AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM, AND THE
PROGRESS OF THE DIVISIONS.
THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.

THE ASSOCIATION HAS 650 MEMBERS INCLUDING NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES,
ALL STATE LIBRARIES EXCEPT THAT OF BAVARIA, SPECIAL LIBRARIES, CHURCH
LIBRARIES, INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIES AND ALL SIZES OF PUBLIC LIBRARY. THERE ARE
SECTIONS FOR EACH TYPE OF LIBRARY AND GROUPS WITHIN EACH STATE. THE
ASSOCIATION'S WORK INCLUDES' ESTABLISHING LIBRARIANSHIP TARGETS, ESPECIALLY
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE 1973 DEVELOPMENT PLAN; PROMOTING PUBLIC
UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES; REPRESENTING LIBRARY INTERESTS
TO THE NATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS; COOPERATING
WITH OTHER INTERESTED BODIES CONCERNED WITH THE NATIONAL INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME; REPRESENTING LIBRARY INTERESTS CONCERNING
THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, COPYRIGHT LAW AND DATA PROTECTION;
AND ADVISING ON STAFFING, ORGANISATION AND TECHNOLOGY.
THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE).

TEXT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH DICK REUMER, DIRECTOR OF THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK
EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM, ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CENTRE.
REUMER BELIEVES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS FACING LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS IN 1982 ARE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO REDUCE SUBSIDIES TO
PUBLIC LIBRARIES BY 15% AND THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE PUBLIC
SERVICES, WHICH WILL REPLACE THE PRESENT PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT. FOR THE NBLC THE
NEW LEGISLATION WILL MEAN THE DECENTRALISATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES THROUGHOUT
THE REGIONS AND CLOSER COOPERATION AMONGST LIBRARIES IN THE SAME AREA. TO
CELEBRATE THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NBLC A JUBILEE CONGRESS IS TO BE HELD AT
WHICH THE CENTRE'S SERVICES WILL COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AND WILL BE MORE
ACTIVELY PROMOTED TO THE PUBLIC.
PERCEPTIONS BY EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS OF THE RANKING OF LIBRARY SCHOOL
PROGRAMS.

A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE PROFESSIONAL PERCEPTION OF HIGHEST-QUALITY
LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES. THE SURVEY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE PERCEPTION
RANKINGS OF EXCELLENCE IN 4 CATEGORIES' QUALITY OF MASTER'S PROGRAMME, QUALITY
OF DOCTORAL PROGRAMME FOR THE PREPARATION OF EDUCATORS, QUALITY OF DOCTORAL
PROGRAMME FOR THE PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATORS, AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE
PROFESSION BY THE FACULTY AS A WHOLE. RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF
EARLIER, SMALLER SAMPLE STUDIES, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO
EXAMINE THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF SCHOOLS GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS BEING OF
HIGH QUALITY ARE ADVANCED. SUGGESTS THAT AN EXAMINATION OF THESE QUALITIES IN
HIGHLY PERCEIVED SCHOOLS CAN LEAD TO A MEANINGFUL UPGRADING OF PRESENT
EVALUATIVE STANDARDS.
A CONVERSATION WITH NORMAN HORROCKS.

AN INTERVIEW WITH NORMAN HORROCKS, DIRECTOR, SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SERVICE,
DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY, HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA. DISCUSSES LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND

THE NEED FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS IN HIGHER VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION: REPORT OF A QUESTIONNAIRE HELD BY THE HBO GROUP COMMITTEE OF THE
DUTCH ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS.

SINCE THE FORMATION IN 1976 OF THE GROUP FOR LIBRARIES IN HIGHER VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION WITHIN THE NEDERLANDSE VERENIGING VAN BIBLIOTHECARISSEN,
DOCUMENTALISTEN EN LITERATUURONDERZOEKERS (DUTCH ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS,
DOCUMENTALISTS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS), GROUP MEMBERS HAVE ON SEVERAL
OCCASIONS PROPOSED THAT A SCHEME OF IN-SERVICE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING FOR
LIBRARIANS BE STARTED. IN 1979 THE GROUP COMMITTEE AGREED TO THESE PROPOSALS
AND IN OCT 80 A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED TO MEMBERS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT FORM
SUCH TRAINING SHOULD TAKE. OF THE 79 RESPONDENTS MORE THAN &H EXPRESSED A WISH
FOR COURSES IN AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND LIBRARY
AUTOMATION, AND OVER 75% WERE WILLING TO PURSUE SUCH COURSES IN THEIR SPARE
TIME. THE RESULTS OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE HAVE NOW BEEN PRESENTED TO THE
ASSOCIATI ON OF SCHOOLS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION IN THE NETHERLANDS
FOR CONSIDERATION.
THE BA (HONS) DEGREE COURSE IN EDUCATION AND LIBRARY STUDIES AT LOUGHBOROUGH
UNIVERSITY.

THE VALUE OF DUAL EDUCATION AND LIBRARIANSHIP QUALIFICATIONS FOR LIBRARY WORK
WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IS STRESSED, THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF THE SCHOOL
LIBRARIAN AND THE ENGLISH TEACHER. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE LOUGHBOROUGH
UNIVERSITY 4 YEAR HONOURS DEGREE COURSE IN EDUCATION AND LIBRARY STUDIES.
TEACHING OF THE 2 MAJOR SUBJECT AREAS PROCEEDS CONCURRENTLY, WITH AN
ASSOCIATED ACADEMIC SUBJECT BEING STUDIED IN THE 1ST 2 YEARS. THE CONTENTS OF
THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THESE SUBJECT AREAS ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS OF GRADUATES FROM THE COURSE ARE DISCUSSED.
ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES-ASSISTANTS IN LIBRARIES. A
COMPARISON.

THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE CAREER STRUCTURES OF ASSISTANT
LIBRARIANS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND ASSISTANTS IN LIBRARIES IN WEST
GERMANY. THE PROBLEMS ARISE WITH CAREERS TRAINING; THIS DIFFERS FROM 1 FEDERAL
STATE TO THE NEXT, ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT STANDARDISED NOR ARE THE
SYLLABUSES OR FINAL EXAMINATIONS. THE TYPE OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE PROVIDING
TRAINING ALSO VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE AND MAY BE A LIBRARY COLLEGE, A
TRAINING LIBRARY OR A POLYTECHNIC. THERE IS NO CLEARLY DEFINED CAREER
STRUCTURE FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS OR ASSISTANTS WHICH CAUSES DIFFICULTIES
WITHIN LIBRARIES WHEN ALLOCATING DUTIES AND DIFFICULTIES IN SALARY GRADES. IT
IS NECESSARY TO AIM AT A JOINT CAREERS TRAINING SCHEME FOR BOTH ASSISTANT
LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY ASSISTANTS BUT BEFORE THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED THE ABOVE
MENTIONED PROBLEMS MUST BE SETTLED.
TRAINING LIBRARY ASSISTANTS IN MAURITIUS.

THE UNIVERSITY OF MAURITIUS WITH THE FINANCIAL HELP OF THE INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CENTRE OF CANADA (IDRC) EMBARKED ON A 15 MONTH
EXPERIMENTAL COURSE IN 1978 FOR THE TRAINING OF LIBRARY ASSISTANTS WHO WERE
ALREADY WORKING IN LIBRARIES. THE MAIN AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS TO EVOLVE A
COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 YEAR TAKING 3 AFTERNOONS WEEKLY, GEARED TO LOCAL
CONDITIONS AND USING AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THE EXPERIMENT WAS A SUCCESS AND THE
COURSE, AFTER MINOR ALTERATIONS, WAS CONTINUED IN 1981.
BUT...IT COULD BE BETTER!': TOWARDS A THIRD EDITION OF THE HANDBOOK OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION.I

N REPLY TO CRITICISM OF THE 2ND EDITION OF 2BIBLIOTHEEK EN DOCUMENTATIE'
HANDBOEK TEN DIENSTE VAN DE OPLEIDINGEN1 (2LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION' A
HANDBOOK FOR STUDENTS1) PUBLISHED IN DEC 79, THE EDITORIAL BOARD POINT OUT THE
DIFFICULTY OF PRODUCING A TEXTBOOK TO SUIT THE MANY DIFFERING COURSES IN
LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE NETHERLANDS. HOWEVER, IN THE 3RD EDITION OF THE BOOK,
WHICH IS DUE FOR PUBLICATION IN SPRING 83, SEVERAL CHAPTERS WILL BE DEVOTED TO
GENERAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, INCLUDING THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIBRARIANSHIP.
IN ADDITION, THE NEW EDITION WILL CONTAIN MORE FACTS AND EXAMPLES TO
ILLUSTRATE THE THEORETICAL ASPECTS, AND WILL BE MORE READABLE.
THE P.A. TIELE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE HANDBOOK OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND
DOCUMENTATION.

DURING FEB 81 STAFF OF THE P.A. TIELE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE HAGUE,
NETHERLANDS DISCUSSED THE USE OF 2BIBLIOTHEEK EN DOCUMENTATIE' HANDBOEK TEN
DIENSTE VAN DE OPLEIDINGEN1 (2LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION' A HANDBOOK FOR
STUDENTS1) 2ND EDITION, 1979 AS A TEACHING INSTRUMENT. THE HANDBOOK IS USED AT
THE SCHOOL AS A BASIC INTRODUCTION FOR STUDENTS TO A NUMBER OF COURSE
SUBJECTS. HOWEVER, INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF A NUMBER OF TOPICS AND THE USE OF
SPECIALISED TERMINOLOGY MAKE THE WORK UNSUITABLE FOR USE AS A STUDENT
TEXTBOOK. IN ADDITION, THE TEXT OF THE BOOK, WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY SEVERAL
AUTHORS, SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF BALANCE AND IS FURTHER MARRED BY AN INADEQUATE
INDEX.
REFERENCE BOOK OR TEXTBOOK?.

IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE VIEWS OF LECTURERS AND STUDENTS ON THE 2ND EDITION
OF 2BIBLIOTHEEK EN DOKUMENTATIE' HANDBOEK TEN DIENSTE VAN DE OPLEIDINGEN1
(2LIBRARIES AND DOCUMENTATION' A HANDBOOK FOR STUDENTS1) PUBLISHED IN 1979,
THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF 2OPEN1 CIRCULATED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ALL LIBRARY
SCHOOLS IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT MOST LECTURERS AND
STUDENTS MADE USE OF THE BOOK, ALTHOUGH A FEW HAD NOT USED IT AT ALL, BECAUSE,
THEY FELT, CERTAIN TOPICS WERE INSUFFICIENTLY COVERED, INCLUDING AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS, CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND LIBRARY AUTOMATION. THE RESULTS ALSO
SHOWED THAT THE BOOK WAS USED MORE AS A TEXTBOOK TO PROVIDE INFORMATION
ADDITIONAL TO THAT OBTAINED IN LECTURES, RATHER THAN AS A REFERENCE BOOK.
HOWEVER, ON THE WHOLE MOST RESPONDENTS FELT THE BOOK TO BE A USEFUL
INTRODUCTION TO LIBRARIANSHIP.
THE LEEDS EVALUATION OF THE BISHOPSBURY CASE STUDY.

PART 1 BY KEN JONES REPORTS ON AN EVALUATION BY LEEDS POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP OF THE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SIMULATION TEACHING PACKAGE. THE
BISHOPSBURY SIMULATION WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY LEONARD GUY AND STUART MILLS BY
EALING COLLEGE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. PART 2 BY NORAGH JONES DESCRIBES
SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCE OF INTEGRATING BISHOPSBURY INTO THE LEEDS BA
LIBRARIANSHIP COURSE AND WIDENING ITS SCOPE. ALSO DISCUSSES POSSIBLE FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS AND POTENTIAL OF THE SIMULATION FOR TEACHING INFORMATION SOURCES
AND RETRIEVAL AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT.
WISER FROM EXPERIENCE: A STUDY OF PRACTICAL WORK AS AN ELEMENT OF LIBRARY
EDUCATION.

LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSES HAVE FOR A LONG TIME INCLUDED PERIODS OF PRACTICAL WORK
TO ENABLE STUDENTS TO APPLY THEIR THEORETICAL TRAINING TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS
IN LIBRARIES. SUCH PERIODS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF 'SELF-ORIENTATION' PERIODS,
PROVIDING THE STUDENT WITH ALL-ROUND EXPERIENCE OF LIBRARY TECHNIQUES OR
'EXPERIENCE' PERIODS, DURING WHICH THE STUDENT MAY CARRY OUT DETAILED STUDY OF
A PARTICULAR TOPIC. IN THE NETHERLANDS MOST LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSES ARE TOO
SHORT TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO GAIN MORE THAN A BRIEF VIEW OF LIBRARY ROUTINES IN
PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS OFTEN FAIL TO DERIVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM
THEIR PRACTICAL TRAINING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE PREPARATION BY THE LIBRARY
SCHOOLS AND THE HEAVY WORKLOAD OF COURSE TUTORS. THERE SHOULD BE REGULAR
CONSULTATION BETWEEN STUDENT, COURSE-TUTOR AND TRAINING LIBRARY TO ENSURE THAT
ALL ASPECTS OF PRACTICAL TRAINING ARE BEING COVERED.

LIBRARY'.
LIBRARIES IN THE REPUBLIC OF MALI.

BEFORE POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE, EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES WERE DOMINATED BY 2
COLONIAL POWERS, THE ARABS IN THE 11TH CENTURY AND THE FRENCH IN THE 19TH.
SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1960 EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES HAVE DEVELOPED TO TRY AND
OVERCOME ILLITERACY. THE FORMER LIBRARY OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR BLACK
AFRICA BECAME THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF THE NEW REPUBLIC OF MALI, RESPONSIBLE
FOR COLLECTION OF MATERIAL AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY FOR
LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SCHOOLS AND IN INSTITUTIONS FOR
HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH. BOOK PRODUCTION IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL
LANGUAGES IS BEING EXPANDED. THERE ARE AT PRESENT A TOTAL OF 46 PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WITH STOCKS OF BETWEEN 600-1,000 ITEMS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN.
THERE ARE ALSO LIBRARIES IN THE CULTURAL CENTRES OF FOREIGN EMBASSIES, SOME
PRIVATE ROMAN CATHOLIC LIBRARIES AND THE LIBRARIES OF INTERNATIONAL
ORGANISATIONS.
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY RESOURCES.

EXTRACT FROM RECENT TRENDS IN RESOURCE ACQUISITION IN AUSTRALIAN ACADEMIC AND
RESEARCH LIBRARIES, A PAPER PRESENTED BY G.G. ALLEN AND J.R. BROCKMAN AT THE
47TH IFLA CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG, AUG 81. TABULATES AND DISCUSSES THE
DISTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES BY STATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NATIONAL
RESOURCES, DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, AND LIBRARY BOOKS/INHABITANT (ALL
1933-79). RESOURCES ARE FAR FROM EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE MAJOR POPULATION
CENTRES; CANBERRA IS PARTICULARLY WELL SERVED; AND VICTORIA (2ND MOST POPULOUS
STATE AND CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA'S ESTABLISHMENT AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY) IS
SURPRISINGLY BADLY SERVED.
THE LIBRARY OF THE HAMBURG CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

THERE HAS BEEN A COMMERCIAL LIBRARY IN HAMBURG SINCE 1735. STOCKS INCLUDE
ABOUT 140,000 BOOKS AND OVER 500 GERMAN AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE PERIODICALS;
ABOUT 3,000 ITEMS ARE ADDED ANNUALLY. ALTHOUGH MUCH MATERIAL WAS DESTROYED IN
WORLD WAR II THE LIBRARY IS STILL VALUABLE TO BUSINESS PEOPLE, STUDENTS AND
RESEARCH WORKERS. SUBJECTS COVERED INCLUDE ECONOMICS, SOCIAL SCIENCE,
COMMERCIAL LAW, POLITICS AND PSYCHOLOGY. THE PROXIMITY OF THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY OBVIATES THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE SUBJECT COVERAGE, WHICH IS AN
ADVANTAGE OWING TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS, THE CURRENT FINANCIAL
CRISIS AND THE GROWTH OF NEW SUBJECTS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
TRADITIONAL MANUAL PROCESSING METHODS ARE STILL FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE HERE,
ALTHOUGH ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING MAY BE IMPLEMENTED LATER.
THE LIMITS OF THE COMPREHENSIBLE' REFLECTIONS ON MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 81ST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
MONTREAL, 2 JUNE 81. THE CURRENT STATE OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY FIELD IS
EXPLORED WITH EMPHASIS ON HOW CHANGES IN PERSPECTIVE AND APPROACH MAY BE
INSTITUTED. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE ATTITUDES AND SKILLS OF THE
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIAN AS RELATED TO INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANISATIONS.
ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE STUDY GROUP ON MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP 1980.

THE GROUP, FOUNDED IN 1966, HAS 140 MEMBERS INVOLVED IN MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION
IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND HOSPITAL LIBRARIES IN
GERMANY, AUSTRIA AND SWITZERLAND. THEIR PAST WORK HAS COVERED KEYWORD
CATALOGUES, ADVANCED TRAINING IN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION AND THE USE OF
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA IN MEDICAL TRAINING. TOPICS DISCUSSED HERE INCLUDED THE
PUBLISHING OF RESEARCH RESULTS IN BASIC SCIENTIFIC ENGLISH, CHANGES IN THE
DIMDI NETWORK FEES SYSTEM, DOCUMENTATION IN THE GERMAN HOSPITAL INSTITUTE, THE
PROJECT ON IMPROVING HANOVER HOSPITAL LIBRARIES, ACCESS FOR INDUSTRIAL
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES TO EXTERNAL DATA BASES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
COMPUTERISED DOCUMENTATION CENTRES AND ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, THE WORK OF THE
CENTRAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE IN COLOGNE.
ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL PLAN (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK OF THE RNSKHBINFORM OF THE
KIRGIZ SSR).

THE PROVISION OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SERVICES IN KIRGIZIA HAS GREATLY
IMPROVED WITH THE FOUNDATION, IN 1975, OF THE RESPUBLIKANSKAYA NAUCHNAYA
SELSKOKHOZYAISTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA (AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY OF THE REPUBLIC), ITS
DESIGNATION AS THE CENTRE OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SERVICES, AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRALISED NETWORK OF AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES. THESE
FACTORS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROVISION OF CENTRALLY PLANNED, ORGANISED
AND COORDINATED BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION COMPRISING' REFERENCE INFORMATION
SERVICES, PROVISION OF CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION TO AGRICULTURAL
SPECIALISTS, ANSWERING OF INDIVIDUAL ENQUIRIES, COMPILATION OF CURRENT AND
RETROSPECTIVE SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHIES, AND THE PROMOTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
MATERIALS. THE USE OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY'S STOCK BY SPECIALISTS IN REMOTE
RURAL AREAS IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH AN INTERLIBRARY LENDING SERVICE RUN BY
THE NET WORK.
ART LIBRARIES IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.

PAPER PRESENTED TO THE ART LIBRARIES SECTION AT THE IFLA CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG,
AUG 81. THE BACKGROUND AND RANGE OF ART LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY ARE
OUTLINED, AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE HOLDINGS OF MAJOR LIBRARIES GIVEN.
IMPORTANT BIBLIOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS PRODUCED BY LIBRARIES ARE NOTED, AND AN
ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANISATION UNITING ART LIBRARIANS IN EAST
GERMANY IS PROVIDED.
STAGNATION IN THE KIBBUTZ LIBRARY.

2 CHARACTERISTICS OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES ARE GIVING CAUSE FOR CONCERN;
DECENTRALISATION; AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIANS. DECENTRALISATION
HAS HISTORIC AND SOCIAL CAUSES. FORMERLY, MOST LIBRARIANS WERE VOLUNTEERS AND
VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE KIBBUTZ POPULATION HAD SEPARATE AREAS OF RESIDENCE AND
ACTIVITY. MODERN KIBBUTZ SOCIETY AND ORGANISATION HAVE CHANGED, BUT MANY SMALL
LIBRARIES HAVE REMAINED IN EXISTENCE. DECENTRALISATION HAS MANY DRAWBACKS'
INEFFICIENCY, AREAS OF INTEREST NOT COVERED BY ANY LIBRARY, INCONVENIENCE OF
MANY READERS AND LACK OF A STRONG LIBRARY THAT COULD BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN
THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ. THE 24 LIBRARIANS SERVING IN THE KIBBUTZIM
SURVEYED AVERAGED 53.3 YEARS, ONLY 5 OF THEM BEING YOUNGER THAN 50. THIS
SITUATION RULES OUT MUCH IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION. CALLS FOR A
SERIOUS ACADEMIC STUDY OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES.
SHOULD HOPE BE ABANDONED BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS?.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE WORD 'PUBLIC' MUST BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN
CONNECTION WITH LIBRARIES. PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED IN SELECTING FICTION
AND LEISURE MATERIAL. READERS DISLIKE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRIVIAL MATERIAL AS
MUCH AS THE ELITIST APPROACH BUT THE ILLITERACY OF SOME SECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC
IS PREFERABLE TO THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE OF THE NON-READER. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
MUST BRING A NEW QUALITY TO ITS PUBLIC SERVICE, EXERCISING A CORRECTIVE
FUNCTION IN RESPECT OF BOOK MARKET TRENDS. LIBRARIANS MUST MOUNT AN OFFENSIVE
ACTION IN PURSUIT OF THE SENSIBLE, SOCIAL AND HUMANE ASPECTS OF THEIR SERVICE.
IT IS DANGEROUS TO ATTACH TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO STATISTICS. LITERATURE SHOULD
BE PROVIDED THAT CROSSES ALL ARBITRARY BORDERS AND STIMULATES THE MIND.
THE MAIN TASKS FOR CZECHOSLOVAK LIBRARIES AFTER THE XVITH COMMUNIST PARTY
CONGRESS.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ACTING AS AN EFFECTIVE ASSISTANT OF PARTY ORGANS AND
ORGANISATIONS, PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GAINING SUPPORT FOR THE COMMUNIST
PARTY POLICIES, ITS PROGRAMME FOR WORLD PEACE AND THE BUILDING OF A DEVELOPED
SOCIALIST SOCIETY. TOGETHER WITH THE CZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION THEY ARE TO PLAY AN EVEN MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN MAKING
AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND RESEARCH. THE SYSTEM OF
INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE SPHERE OF CULTURE AND THE ARTS WITHIN A PARTICULAR
REGION IS BEING PREPARED BY THE SETTING UP OF REGIONAL INFORMATION CENTRES.
BIBLIOGRAPHY WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION OF
INFORMATION. STATISTICS, LIBRARY PLANNING AND THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF
THEORETICAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND OF LIBRARY RESEARCH ARE TO BECOME EVEN MORE
IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN THE TIME TO COME.
SOME COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIANSHIP.

SINCE WORLD WAR II THERE HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN THE NETHERLANDS
IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICAL CARE, SOCIAL WELFARE
AND EDUCATION. THIS GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED IN AN ORDERLY MANNER BUT HAS
COME ABOUT BY THE SUDDEN EXPANSION OF SEPARATE SECTORS. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES HAS BECOME A SUBJECT FOR MUCH DISCUSSION IN THE
DUTCH PARLIAMENT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE PROVISION FOR
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES.
IN FUTURE FACTORS WHICH WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES INCLUDE
THE SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE REDUCED
BIRTH-RATE. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES A REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES IS
NECESSARY.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN INDIA.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ZENTRALINSTITUT FUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE
OF LIBRARIANSHIP) FEB 81. THE INDIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM DEVELOPED AFTER THE
FOUNDING OF THE REPUBLIC IN 1950. THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT IS A NATIONAL
FRAMEWORK LAW. EACH STATE HAS A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THERE ARE ALSO CENTRAL
REGIONAL LIBRARIES IN MADRAS, BOMBAY AND DELHI. BELOW THESE ARE THE DISTRICT
LIBRARIES, EACH RESPONSIBLE FOR BETWEEN 40 AND 80 BRANCH LIBRARIES. MOBILE
LIBRARIES SERVE AREAS WHERE POPULATION IS PARTICULARLY SCATTERED. THERE ARE
ALSO UNIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND SOME PRIVATE LENDING
LIBRARIES. CURRENT PROBLEMS INCLUDE A LARGE POPULATION, A WIDE RANGE OF ETHNIC
GROUPS, RELIGIONS AND LANGUAGES, ILLITERACY, INADEQUATE SCHOOLING AND A
SHORTAGE OF MONEY.
THE CAMPAIGN FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NEW SOUTH WALES, 1929-1950.

THE PERIOD 1890-1930 WITNESSED A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
NEW SOUTH WALES BUT BY 1930 SEVERAL PROMINENT CITIZENS BEGAN TO SEE THEM AS
USEFUL ADJUNCTS TO THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION. THE CARNEGIE
CORPORATION OF NEW YORK PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE FREE LIBRARY
MOVEMENT WAS SET UP IN SYDNEY. MASS DEMAND FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS NOT REALLY
A MOTIVE FORCE IN THE REVIVAL. WORLD WAR 2 EMPHASISED THE NEED TO PRESERVE
DEMOCRACY THROUGH EDUCATION AND ALSO ESTABLISHED THE IDEA THAT CULTURE WAS NOT
THE PRESERVE OF THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE ALONE. POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION BROUGHT
WITH IT A TIDE OF LARGELY BRITISH IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES. THE IMPETUS PROVIDED BY THE WAR WAS SHORT LIVED,
HOWEVER, AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE FORCED TO STAND ALONE. THIS TIME THEY WERE
ABLE TO SURVIVE THROUGH THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE LIBRARIANS.
REPORT ON THE BILATERAL SEMINAR BETWEEN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC AND
FINLAND' LIBRARY WORK IN RURAL AREAS.

THE SEMINAR TOOK PLACE DURING THE 47TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF IFLA, AUG 81.
THE 2 COUNTRIES HAVE AN AGREEMENT ON LIBRARY COOPERATION. SUBJECTS DISCUSSED
INCLUDED' LIBRARIANSHIP IN EAST GERMANY AND FINLAND; LIBRARY WORK IN RURAL
AREAS; THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS OF BOTH COUNTRIES IN DEVELOPING
RURAL LIBRARIES; AND QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING OF PART-TIME STAFF IN RURAL
LIBRARIES. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WAS PLACED UPON THE USE OF LOCAL COMMUNITY
ASSOCIATIONS IN ADMINISTRATION, DIVISION OF WORK BETWEEN MUNICIPAL, REGIONAL
CENTRAL AND BRANCH LIBRARIES WITHIN A NETWORK AND THE ROLE AND EFFECTIVITY OF
MOBILE LIBRARIES. ALSO DISCUSSED WERE LIBRARY STANDARDS, SATURDAY OPENING
HOURS AND REGULAR TRAINING OF CHILDREN IN LIBRARY USE.
N.K. KRUPSKAYA AND CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO
RURAL POPULATIONS.

RAISING THE CULTURAL LEVEL OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IS STILL A MAJOR TASK OF
SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE 1980S. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PRODUCED GREAT
QUANTITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN RURAL LIBRARY SERVICES, BUT QUALITATIVELY MUCH
STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. N.K. KRUPSKAYA WAS CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THIS VERY
PROBLEM IN THE 1930S AND HER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL VALID TODAY. IF WHAT
SHE WROTE THEN CAN BE PUT INTO PRACTICE NOW, THE GAP BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF
SERVICE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY CAN BE RAPIDLY NARROWED.
INTAMEL CONFERENCE IN BUDAPEST, 1981.

26 LIBRARIES AND 12 COUNTRIES WERE REPRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF METROPOLITAN CITY LIBRARIES CONFERENCE. NEW PROJECTS FOR THE
COMING YEAR WILL INCLUDE COMPUTERISATION AND MAINTENANCE OF BASIC SERVICES IN
A TIME OF WORLD RECESSION. 2 MAIN CONFERENCE TOPICS WERE' ADVANTAGES OF
CENTRALISING THE STOCKS OF LARGE LIBRARIES, OR BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO SUBJECT
SPECIALISATIONS. DISCUSSION WAS BASED ON A PAPER PRODUCED BY THE HUNGARIAN
LIBRARY INSTITUTE; AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS ORIGINATING FROM
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES-THIS VARIES WIDELY ACCORDING TO THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE,
BUT SOME LIBRARIES PRODUCE A GREAT DEAL OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. A VARIETY
OF VISITS DURING THE CONFERENCE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES
WERE MUCH INFLUENCED BY WESTERN DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT LIBRARIES WERE HEAVILY
USED.
DEDICATED AND UNCONVENTIONAL LIBRARY WORKS' IMPRESSIONS FROM BIRMINGHAM.

BIRMINGHAM HAS 1 OF THE LARGEST AND BEST LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN EUROPE, WITH A
TOTAL LIBRARY BUDGET OF OVER 7 MILLION POUNDS AND OVER 2 MILLION STOCK ITEMS
FOR 1 MILLION INHABITANTS. STRIKING FEATURES OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY INCLUDE A
QUICK REFERENCE AND TRADE SECTION OF OVER 7,000 WORKS AND 7 REFERENCE
DEPARTMENTS. THE 45 BRANCHES DIVIDE INTO 4 REGIONAL GROUPS IN ORDER TO
MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE CENTRAL LIBRARY BUT YET RETAIN A MEASURE OF
INDEPENDENCE. MANY COPE WITH SOCIAL PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY IN THE INNER CITY
AREA. AN ETHNIC MINORITIES LIBRARIAN COORDINATES ALL SERVICES TO FOREIGN
READERS. STUDY GROUPS ORGANISE PROJECTS ON REFERENCE MATERIAL, LIBRARY
PUBLICATIONS, RADIO PROGRAMMES AND STAFF TRAINING. IN CONTRAST WITH MANY
GERMAN LIBRARIES, SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ARE GIVEN PARTICULAR PROMINENCE; IN
ADDITION TO SECTIONS IN EACH BRANCH LIBRARY THERE ARE ALSO 2 CENTRAL
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES.
WE'LL MEET IN SINDELFINGEN.

SINDELFINGEN, THE VENUE OF THE 1982 CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF
LIBRARIANS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS A POPULATION OF 56,000. IN RECENT YEARS A
LARGE INCREASE IN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS RESULTED IN A NEED FOR THE RAPID
AND IMPROVED PROVISION OF SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES AND OTHER PUBLIC FACILITIES. THE
1ST PUBLIC LIBRARY OPENED HERE IN 1909; THE PRESENT BUILDING WAS OPENED IN
1970, PARTLY FINANCED BY THE DAIMLER BENZ COMPANY. IN 1980 NATIONAL LIBRARY
STATISTICS REVEALED THAT SINDELFINGEN HAS THE HIGHEST PURCHASING BUDGET AMONG
LIBRARIES OF COMPARABLE SIZE' 5.70 DM PER INHABITANT, WITH A STOCK SIZE OF 2.6
MEDIA UNITS PER INHABITANT. THE MULTI-PURPOSE BUILDING ALSO HOUSES ART
EXHIBITIONS, A COMMUNAL CINEMA AND FACILITIES FOR THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES AND
PUBLIC MEETINGS.
HAMBURG PUBLIC LIBRARIES-DRAFT DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

THE 10 YEAR PLAN, PUBLISHED IN OCT 81, CONCENTRATES ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND
LOOKS AT LIBRARY PROVISION IN THE CITY IN THE LIGHT OF THE EVER-INCREASING
OUTPUT OF BOOKS AND NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND OF HAMBURG'S GROWING IMMIGRANT
POPULATION. DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY PROVISION HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH DEMAND,
PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIAL CATEGORIES (E.G. HANDICAPPED PEOPLE). WAYS OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES NEEDS REAPPRAISAL. THE ROLE OF THE BRANCH LIBRARY
IN MEETING THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MUST BE EXAMINED AND
BETTER ACCOMMODATION IS NEEDED IF THE SERVICE IS TO EXPAND. THE INTRODUCTION
OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES SHOULD RELEASE STAFF TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE
SERVICE.
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

CONSIDERS THE ROLE THAT LIBRARIES HAVE TO PLAY AT ALL EDUCATIONAL LEVELS, AS
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS UNDERGOING A RESTRUCTURING PROCESS. GIVES STATISTICS
SHOWING THE EDUCATIONAL GRADE COMPLETED FOR AGES BETWEEN 24 AND 60.

INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICAL TABLES ARE DATA ON LIBRARY COLLECTIONS, STAFF, AND
OPERATING EXPENDITURES FOR EACH INSTITUTION. DEVELOPMENTAL AREAS COVERED ARE
LIBRARY LOANS, TRANSACTIONS, HOURS OF SERVICE, AND MEAN SALARY OF FULL-TIME
LIBRARY STAFF. ADDITIONAL SUMMARY TABLES INCLUDE AVAILABLE TREND DATA FOR FALL
77 THROUGH FALL 79. ENROLLMENTS FOR EACH COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ARE PROVIDED
FOR THE YEARS SURVEYED, IN ORDER THAT THE STATISTICAL DATA MAY BE REVIEWED IN
RELATION TO USER DEMAND FOR LIBRARY SERVICES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
AN OUTLINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SENCKENBERG LIBRARY IN FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN.

THE LIBRARY IS PART OF A FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED IN 1763 BY DR. JOHANN
CHRISTIAN SENCKENBERG. IN THE 19TH CENTURY, SEVERAL LEARNED SOCIETIES
AMALGAMATED THEIR LIBRARIES WITH IT; THE STOCKS, COMPRISING WORKS IN NATURAL
SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, WERE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY LOCAL DOCTORS AND MEMBERS OF
THE NEWLY FORMED ASSOCIATION. IN 1907 THE LIBRARY WAS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC;
NEW PREMISES WERE USED AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF EMPLOYED. AFTER A PERIOD OF
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY DURING WORLD WAR I, THE JOHANN-WOLFGANG-GOETHE UNIVERSITY
TOOK OVER FINANCIAL CONTROL OF THE LIBRARY. IN 1947 A NEW AGREEMENT WAS MADE,
GIVING THE UNIVERSITY MORE POWERS IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND IN 1966 THE
LIBRARY WAS MOVED INTO NEW PREMISES WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
THE UNIVERSITY OF PETROLEUM AND MINERALS: A MODEL FOR AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY.

THE UNIVERSITY OF PETROLEUM AND MINERALS LIBRARY, DHAHRAN, SAUDI ARABIA, IS
ORGANISED USING LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CLASSIFICATION AND AACR. 75% OF THE
160,000 VOLUMES COVER SCIENCES. THERE ARE ALSO OVER 300,000 NONPRINT ITEMS AND
3,800 PERIODICALS. THE LIBRARY OFFERS ACCESS TO EXTERNAL RESOURCES,
PHOTOCOPYING, LIBRARY ORIENTATION PROGRAMMES AND LITERATURE SEARCHING.
DOBIS/LIBIS, AN ON-LINE, INTEGRATED INTERACTIVE SYSTEM, IS BEING IMPLEMENTED
FOR THE AUTOMATION OF ALL LIBRARY FUNCTIONS.
RELEVANCE OF UAP IN A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM IN MEXICO.

AN OUTLINE IS GIVEN OF THE BACKGROUND OF THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IN A UNIVERSITY
WITH 1 OF THE LARGEST STUDENT ENROLMENTS IN THE WORLD (OVER 300,000 STUDENTS).
THIS SYSTEM COVERS 164 DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES WHICH PROVIDE SERVICE AT
DIFFERENT ACADEMIC LEVELS. IT HAS A DIRECTORATE-GENERAL OF LIBRARIES WHICH
PROVIDES TECHNICAL COORDINATION FOR THE SYSTEM AND A CENTRAL LIBRARY
SUPPORTING THE DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES. AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE PROGRAMMES
THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN SUPPORT OF THE LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE
UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP), IN PARTICULAR THE LIBRUNAM
AUTOMATED SYSTEM, TRAINING WORKSHOPS AND CONTINUING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
PROGRAMMES.

REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE FUTURE OF THE BARR SMITH LIBRARY.

A CONDENSED VERSION OF THE 2REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BARR SMITH LIBRARY1, UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE. THE
COMMITTEE'S TERMS OF REFERENCE WERE TO DETERMINE THE FORM IN WHICH THE LIBRARY
SHOULD DEVELOP AND TO CONSIDER THE METHODS, SCALE OF ACQUISITION AND STORAGE
OF BOOKS TO BE EMPLOYED. THE REPORT PLANS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY FOR
15 YEARS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE URGENCY OF THE CURRENT PROBLEMS AND
PREVAILING FUNDING LEVELS.
THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FORESTRY AND TIMBER INDUSTRY IN
SOPRON.

THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FORESTRY AND TIMBER INDUSTRY DATES BACK TO
THE 18TH CENTURY. A SCHOOL OF MINING WAS FOUNDED BY KING KARL III IN 1735.
THIS SCHOOL DEVELOPED AND FROM 1770 ALSO TAUGHT FORESTRY SCIENCE. IN 1808 IT
BECAME AN INSTITUTE OF FORESTRY, AND THIS REFLECTED ON THE CONTENTS OF THE
LIBRARY WHICH EXPANDED TO COVER NEW SUBJECT AREAS. THE INSTITUTE BECAME THE
ACADEMY OF MINING AND FORESTRY IN 1846 AND ONLY ACQUIRED UNIVERSITY STATUS IN
1934. THE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY THE 1ST WORLD WAR,
INADEQUATE BUILDINGS AND LACK OF STAFF. WITH THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY A
NEW LIBRARY WAS ALSO PLANNED. THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING WAS OPENED IN 1977. IT
IS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN HUNGARY, DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO SPECIALIST
LITERATURE CONCERNING FORESTRY AND THE TIMBER INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY IS
EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST TECHNICAL FACILITIES AND PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT
SERVICE TO ITS USERS.
THE LIBRARY OF THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, HAMBURG-HARBURG.

THE LIBRARY, NOT YET COMPLETED, IS CONCEIVED AS A CENTRAL LIBRARY WITH ONLY 1
SEPARATE DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY, COVERING A TOTAL AREA OF 3,800 SQ.M. STOCKS
WILL ULTIMATELY INCLUDE 500,000 BOOKS AND 4,000 PERIODICALS, ADDING 20,000
ITEMS ANNUALLY. MATERIALS WILL BE STORED IN SUBJECT READING ROOMS AND CLOSED
ACCESS STACKS. PURCHASING WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY THE LIBRARIAN IN COOPERATION
WITH UNIVERSITY STAFF. MOST NEW GERMAN MATERIAL WILL BE BOUGHT, WITH
RETROSPECTIVE COVERAGE FOR 1970-80; SELECTIVE PURCHASES OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE
MATERIAL WILL BE MADE. ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING WILL BE USED FOR' ON-LINE
SEARCHING; CATALOGUING, IN COOPERATION WITH HAMBURG UNIVERSITY; ISSUES;
INTERLOANS WITH OTHER LOCAL AND REGIONAL LIBRARIANS; AND LISTS OF
ACQUISITIONS.
HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY OF GRAZ TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY 1875-1975.

PART 1 OF AN ARTICLE ON THE HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY AT GRAZ TECHNICAL
UNIVERSITY. THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY WERE LAID IN 1811 WHEN
ARCHDUKE JOHANN REALISED HIS PLANS FOR A SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION AND DONATED
HIS PRIVATE COLLECTION, INCLUDING BOOKS, TO THE PROVINCE OF STEIERMARK, BUT IT
DID NOT BECOME A STATE INSTITUTION UNTIL 1874 AND A LIBRARY, WITH ITS OWN
BUILDING, BUDGET AND STAFF, WAS NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL 1889. THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE ACADEMIC STAFF AND THE LIBRARY WAS ALWAYS FRAUGHT WITH
DIFFICULTIES AND FULL INDEPENDENCE FOR THE LIBRARY WAS NOT ACHIEVED UNTIL
1960. BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES OF THE 8 LIBRARY DIRECTORS TO DATE AND A REVIEW OF
STAFFING AND BUDGETS UP TO 1975 ARE INCLUDED.
A STUDY OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY' ITS ROLES IN EDUCATION FOR THE HEALTH
SCIENCES.

DISCUSSES THE OBJECTIVES OF A STUDY CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED BY THE
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES OF THE ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES
LIBRARY'S ROLES IN EDUCATION FOR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AS THESE MAY BE
AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN HEALTH INFORMATION HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT. AIMS TO
DEVELOP GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE USE OF ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTRE
ADMINISTRATORS, LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS, FEDERAL AGENCY PERSONNEL, AND OTHERS
INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND POLICY DECISION MAKING FOR HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES.
LIBRARY WORK AT FACTORIES IN SLOVAKIA.

TRADES UNIONS PROVIDE LIBRARIES FOR FACTORY STAFF, ABOUT 10% OF WHICH ARE RUN
BY FULL OR PART-TIME STAFF AND THE REMAINDER BY VOLUNTEERS. THESE LIBRARIES
ARE SEPARATE FROM THE INDUSTRIAL TECHNICAL LIBRARIES WHICH CONCENTRATE ON
SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC MATERIAL. TRADES UNION LIBRARIES BEGAN AT
THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY AND IN 1948 A UNIFIED PLAN FOR THEIR ORGANISATION
AND MODERNISATION WAS BROUGHT IN. THEIR WORK IS COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL
TRADES UNION LIBRARY IN BRATISLAVA AND CLOSE COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES
IS MAINTAINED. MORE UNIFIED STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES ARE REQUIRED FOR LIBRARY
TECHNIQUES. THE LIBRARIES' CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL IMPORTANCE MUST BE
PUBLICISED AND MORE MONEY PROVIDED. STOCKS MUST BE MODERNISED AND MORE
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MATERIAL INCLUDED, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE THERE
IS NO TECHNICAL LIBRARY.
PROPOSED STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY SERVICES IN
HOSPITALS OF NEW YORK STATE.

DISCUSSES IN DETAIL PROPOSED STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL HEALTH SCIENCES
LIBRARY SERVICES, DRAWN UP BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PROMOTION OF HOSPITAL
LIBRARY SERVICES, WESTERN NEW YORK LIBRARY RESOURCES COUNCIL, IN ORDER TO
CLARIFY AND STRENGTHEN EXISTING HOSPITAL LIBRARY STANDARDS. THESE STANDARDS
PLACE EQUAL AND SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON' ADMINISTRATION; QUALIFICATIONS OF
LIBRARY STAFF; CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARY STAFF; REQUIREMENT FOR A
LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE; REQUIRED LIBRARY SERVICES; REQUIRED LIBRARY
RESOURCES; LIBRARY SPACE REQUIREMENTS; LIBRARY BUDGET; LIBRARY NETWORK AND
CONSORTIUM MEMBERSHIP; DOCUMENTATION OF LIBRARY POLICY; AND CONTINUED
EVALUATION OF THE NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL FOR LIBRARY SERVICE. OUTLINES THE
QUALIFICATIONS OF A HOSPITAL LIBRARY CONSULTANT.
DELIVERY OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION TO RURAL PRACTITIONERS.

BASED IN A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, DC, 18 JUNE 80. A PROGRAMME TO DEVELOP LIBRARY
RESOURCES WAS INSTITUTED IN 8 HOSPITALS AND 1 AMBULATORY CARE FACILITY IN THE
RURAL LOW COUNTRY OF SOUTH CAROLINA FROM JULY 78-JULY 79. THE PROGRAMME'S GOAL
WAS TO INCREASE AVAILABILITY AND AWARENESS OF INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES AND
THEIR VALUE IN THE CONTINUING AND IN-SERVICE EDUCATION OF HEALTH PERSONNEL.
REPORTS ON THE PROGRAMME'S INCEPTION, COMPONENTS, EVALUATION, SUCCESS AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR SIMILAR PROGRAMMES.
RIDING THE RURAL LIBRARY CIRCUIT.

THE CIRCUIT RIDER LIBRARIAN CONCEPT IS DISCUSSED. THE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND
GROWTH OF THE CIRCUIT LIBRARIAN PROGRAMME SERVING RURAL HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK
AND PENNSYLVANIA ARE REPORTED. THE CIRCUIT RIDER LIBRARIAN'S SCHEDULE AND
FUNCTIONS ARE DISCUSSED, INCLUDING TIME SPENT ON THE ROAD AND AT THE RESOURCE
LIBRARY, REFERENCE SERVICES AND OTHER LIBRARY SERVICES. FINANCING, BUDGETING,
AND PERSONAL CONTACT ARE STRESSED. DETAILED REFERENCE STATISTICS ARE PROVIDED
TO ILLUSTRATE THE GROWTH OF LIBRARY SERVICES; STATISTICS ARE ALSO ANALYSED BY
REQUESTER CATEGORY. FUTURE DIRECTIONS, POTENTIAL, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE
GIVEN FOR THE CREATION OF CIRCUIT LIBRARY PROGRAMMES.
LIBRARY PROVISION FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGHT PROBLEMS IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE GERMAN CENTRAL
LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND IN LEIPZIG.

THE LIBRARY, FOUNDED IN 1894, HAS TAKEN OVER ALL SELECTION, PRODUCTION,
PRESENTATION AND SALES OF LITERATURE FOR THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED IN
EAST GERMANY. LOAN STOCKS INCLUDE ABOUT 7,000 BOOKS AND 6,000 SCORES IN
BRAILLE AND OVER 3,000 TALKING BOOKS. MORE THAN 1,000 TITLES ARE AVAILABLE FOR
SALE. GENERALLY USERS PREFER NON-FICTION IN BRAILLE AND FICTION ON TAPE OR
CASSETTE. MANY OF THE 2,000 REGULAR USERS BECOME BLIND WHEN ELDERLY, SO THEY
PREFER TALKING BOOKS TO BRAILLE. MONTHLY LISTS OF NEW ADDITIONS TO STOCK ARE
PUBLISHED. INFORMATION ON NEW CHILDREN'S BOOKS IS SENT TO PARENTS AND
INFORMATION ON LARGE PRINT BOOKS TO LIBRARIES AND OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES. CLOSE
COOPERATION IS MAINTAINED WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS IN THIS FIELD, ESPECIALLY
WITH SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND AND MUCH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED FOR SERVICES IN
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

ABSTRACT OF WHICH 2SEE1 82/1573.
LIBRARIES, RADIO AND TELEVISION IN WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

THERE ARE 3 MAIN WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES AND THE MEDIA CAN COOPERATE. RADIO
AND TELEVISION CAN BROADCAST RELEVANT PROGRAMMES SUCH AS DISCUSSIONS,
INTERVIEWS WITH AUTHORS AND STORY READINGS. LIBRARIANS CAN USE TELEVISION AND
RADIO TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON PARTICULAR ISSUES,
RECOMMENDING PROGRAMMES AND LINKING BOOK DISPLAYS TO THEM. ALTERNATIVELY,
LIBRARIANS CAN BE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PROGRAMMES AND CAN
USE THEM TO PUBLICISE POPULAR LITERATURE AND AUTHORS. A SURVEY, UNDERTAKEN IN
ROSTOV, SHOWED HOW EFFECTIVE THIS FORM OF COOPERATION COULD BE, BUT IT IS
OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.
LIBRARY WORK FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE GAMBIA.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE IFLA/UNESCO SEMINAR IN LEIPZIG, AUG 81. IN THE GAMBIA
LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN IS GIVEN PRIORITY OVER THAT WITH ADULTS TO
ENCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF LITERACY. THE SERVICE MUST PROVIDE MATERIAL TO HELP
WITH FORMAL SCHOOLING, ENCOURAGE CREATIVE AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ASSIST
CHILDREN IN FINDING INFORMATION. CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES
CATER FOR THE 11-19 YEAR OLDS; AN ATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE IS MAINTAINED AND
EXTRA ACTIVITIES LIKE STORY HOURS AND FILM SHOWS ARE PROVIDED. THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY HAS CENTRAL CONTROL OVER CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES, PROVIDING SCHOOL
LIBRARY STOCKS AND ADVICE AND TRAINING FOR STAFF. ASSISTANCE IS ALSO PROVIDED
BY THE BRITISH COUNCIL. MORE BOOKS ARE REQUIRED; THERE ARE FEW MODERN
PUBLISHING SERVICES IN THE GAMBIA. MORE MONEY IS NEEDED, ESPECIALLY FOR
PRIMARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS.
LIBRARIES AND THE PROMOTION OF READING HABITS IN CHILDREN.

DISCUSSES THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF CHILDREN TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
OF A NATION, AND APPLAUDS THE UNITED NATIONS FOR DECLARING 1979 THE
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE CHILD. EXAMINES NIGERIA'S NATIONAL POLICY ON
EDUCATION AS IT EFFECTS THE PROVISION BY LIBRARIES OF READING MATERIALS FOR
CHILDREN. PUTS FORWARD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE EFFECTIVE PROVISION OF
PUBLIC AND PRIMARY SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF NIGERIAN
CHILDREN.
THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE EDUCATION PROCESS.

TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLECTIONS OF BOOKS ADJACENT TO EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD TO THE 20TH CENTURY. UNTIL THE END OF THE
MIDDLE AGES COLLECTIONS WERE PART OF CENTRES OF LEARNING AND PROVIDED THE
MEANS OF STUDY FOR STUDENTS. DURING THE PERIOD WHICH STRESSED PROVISION OF A
BASIC EDUCATION FOR ALL THERE WAS A RECESSION IN THE STATUS AND ROLE PLAYED BY
SCHOOL LIBRARIES, A SITUATION CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EDUCATIONAL THEORY, SOCIAL
CHANGES AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UPHEAVALS. FOCUSES ON THE INFLUENCE OF 4
MODERN THEORIES OF EDUCATION UPON THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY. CONCLUDES
WITH A SURVEY OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, ENDING WITH THE
SITUATION IN ISRAEL.
LABORING IN THE VINEYARDS WILL NOT SUFFICE TO SAVE THE SCHOOL LIBRARY VINTAGE.

AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP HAVING MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN THE
1970S APPEARS TO BE IN NEED OF AN INFLUX OF VITALITY IN THE 1980S. OLD AND NEW
PROBLEMS ARE INVESTIGATED, THE NEED FOR SOUND PLANNING IS ASSERTED, THE
QUESTIONS OF ROLE AND PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY ARE ADDRESSED AND A PLACE FOR
SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE LARGER INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT IS ADVOCATED. THE
PROBLEMS OF EDUCATING SCHOOL LIBRARIANS ARE HIGHLIGHTED WITH SUPPORTING
EVIDENCE FROM A RECENT STUDY. CONCLUDING STATEMENTS CALL FOR A CHANGE AND
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH IMPROVED STAFFING LEVELS OF QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS,
COUPLED WITH SOUND MANAGERIAL PLANNING, MONITORING, EDUCATIONAL AND EVALUATIVE
PROCEDURES.
SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROGRAMS AND THE GIFTED AND TALENTED.

DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROGRAMME IN THE
EDUCATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED LEARNERS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO IMPROVE
WAYS IN WHICH THE GIFTED LEARNER CAN FIND AND USE A VARIETY OF MATERIAL.
DESCRIBES BRIEFLY PROGRAMMES FOR GIFTED LEARNERS WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN
THE USA BY' FREDERICK COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS, MARYLAND; TAFT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
LAKEWOOD, OHIO; AND RICHLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT, COLUMBIA, S.C.
THE UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY: LAMONT AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

THIS REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES, THE HISTORICAL
CONTEXT FROM WHICH THEY AROSE, AND THEIR STATUS AT THE END OF THE 70S POINTS
OUT THAT A LONG TRADITION OF LACK OF CONCERN FOR UNDERGRADUATE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
NEEDS WAS BROKEN DRAMATICALLY IN 1949 BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF LAMONT LIBRARY,
THE HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE FACILITY. ALTHOUGH DESIGNED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS UNIQUE
TO HARVARD, LAMONT WAS AN EXEMPLARY CONSTRUCTION THAT SOON CAPTURED THE
IMAGINATION OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY WORLD. IT BECAME THE MODEL FOR A RASH OF
NEW LIBRARIES AIMED AT SATISFYING 'UNIQUE' UNDERGRADUATE NEEDS. THESE
LIBRARIES PROLIFERATED DURING THE 50S AND 60S, A PERIOD OF ACCELERATED GROWTH
IN ACADEME. BY THE 70S, HOWEVER, THE GENERAL FINANCIAL RETRENCHMENT OF
AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAD VIRTUALLY HALTED NEW CONSTRUCTION.
FURTHER, THE THESIS THAT PRESUMED THE NEEDS OF UNDERGRADUATES TO BE SOMEHOW
'DIFFERENT', AS WELL AS THE ADVISABI LITY OF FACILITIES EFFECTIVELY
SEGREGATING THEM FROM THE REST OF THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, CAME UNDER ATTACK IN
THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE. FEW UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES WERE BUILT DURING
THIS PERIOD AND SEVERAL WERE CLOSED OR CONVERTED TO OTHER USES. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
MULTICULTURALISM AND LIBRARIES' A REPORT ON THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
MULTICULTURALISM AND LIBRARIES HELD AT MONASH UNIVERSITY, VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA
FROM 7-11 NOVEMBER 1980.

THE CONFERENCE WAS ORGANISED BY A COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE VICTORIA BRANCH
OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA AND THE WORKING GROUP ON MULTICULTURAL
LIBRARY SERVICES (VICTORIA). PAPERS, RELATING TO THE PROVISION OF
MULTICULTURAL MATERIALS IN LIBRARIES, ARE SUMMARISED.
THE EMERGENCE OF JEWISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NINETEENTH CENTURY PALESTINE.

EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT, IN 19TH CENTURY PALESTINE, OF VARIOUS TYPES OF
PUBLIC LIBRARY' THOSE WHICH STROVE TO GATHER AND ASSEMBLE THE SPIRITUAL
HERITAGE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE; LIBRARIES CREATED FOR USE BY IMMIGRANTS OF THE
1ST ALIYAH; AND THOSE ESTABLISHED TO MEET THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF PUPILS AND
TEACHERS. DISCUSSES THE GROWTH OF THESE LIBRARIES IN THEIR SOCIO-HISTORICAL
CONTEXT, TRACES THEIR HISTORICAL ROOTS IN EUROPE, AND ANALYSES THE FACTORS
WHICH STIMULATED THEIR ESTABLISHMENT, AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH HAD A RETARDING
EFFECT ON THEIR DEVELOPMENT.
LIBRARY WORK WITH FOREIGN WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN HAMBURG PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.

IN HAMBURG LIVE ABOUT 145,000 FOREIGNERS, MAINLY FROM TURKEY, YUGOSLAVIA,
PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE AND SPAIN. ONE LIBRARIAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 25,000
BOOKS, TAPES, NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS IN 6 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES PROVIDED ON
AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 200,000 DM IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND IN BRANCHES SERVING
AREAS WITH A LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATION. THE MAIN STOCK EMPHASIS SO FAR HAS
BEEN ON FICTION FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN; NON-FICTION STOCKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGES WILL NOW BE EXPANDED SINCE INFORMATION IN THEM IS NOT ALWAYS
AVAILABLE IN GERMAN TEXTS. IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT
FOREIGN BOOK MARKETS AND GERMANS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE WORKS THEMSELVES SINCE
FEW TRANSLATIONS ARE AVAILABLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THE CULTURAL
IDENTITY OF FOREIGN RESIDENTS AND TO HELP THEM INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY INTO
WEST GERMAN SOCIETY.
GUIDANCE OF INDIVIDUAL READING AS A WORTHWHILE ACTIVITY.

IN A TIME WHEN LIBRARIANS HAVE TO WORK WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF READERS WITH
DEMANDS OF EVER-INCREASING COMPLEXITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ORGANISE PRECISELY
THE WORK OF INDIVIDUAL READING GUIDANCE. THE PROCESS BY WHICH A READER SELECTS
A BOOK CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO VARIOUS STAGES AND DECISIONS, AND THE LIBRARIAN
CAN EXERT A POSITIVE INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. IF THE AIMS AND STAGES
OF THE LIBRARIAN'S GUIDANCE ARE PLANNED SCHEMATICALLY BEFOREHAND, IT IS
POSSIBLE TO RECORD EACH READER'S PROGRESS AND REACTIONS IN A CONCISE CODED
SYSTEM WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR MOST PUBLIC LIBRARY SITUATIONS.
LITERACY PROGRAMMES AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN JAMAICA.

COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE JAMAICAN MOVEMENT FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LITERACY
(JAMAL) AND THE JAMAICA LIBRARY SERVICE IN PROVIDING NON-FORMAL CONTINUING
EDUCATION FOR NEW LITERATES IS DESCRIBED. INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE
HISTORY AND ORGANISATION OF JAMAL AND THE JAMAICA LIBRARY SERVICE AND DETAILS
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LINKS BETWEEN THE 2 ORGANISATIONS.
RELUCTANT READERS MAKE RELUCTANT READERS.

BASED ON A PAPER GIVEN AT A MEETING OF THE SLAV EASTERN REGION, 16 JULY 81.
THE SUBJECT WAS 'RELUCTANCY, REMEDIATION AND RESOURCES'. DISCUSSES THE REASONS
WHY SOME PUPILS ARE RELUCTANT READERS AND MEANS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO READ
BOOKS AND ESPECIALLY FICTION. INCLUDES A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF RECOMMENDED BOOKS FOR
RELUCTANT OR REMEDIAL READERS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL AGE.
NEWBERY MEDAL BOOKS ARE ALIVE AND WELL AT COURT STREET SCHOOL.

DESCRIBES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NEWBERY BOOK CLUB AT COURT STREET ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL, LANCASTER, NEW YORK, WHICH WAS SET UP TO ENCOURAGE READERS AT 6TH
GRADE LEVEL TO CHOOSE A VARIETY OF GOOD LITERATURE, PARTICULARLY, NEWBERY
AWARD BOOKS. DISCUSSES THE WAY THAT THE CLUB HAS STIMULATED THE LOVE OF
READING AND THE USE OF THE LIBRARY MEDIA CENTRE AS A RESOURCE.
GUIDANCE FOR READERS-THE MAIN TASK OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE FOREMOST TASK OF ALL LIBRARIANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS
TO IMPART TO THEIR READERS THE HABIT OF READING SYSTEMATICALLY AND REGULARLY.
THEY HAVE TO BE CREATIVE AND INVENTIVE IN CATERING FOR THEIR EXISTING READERS,
AND ALSO IN FINDING WAYS WHICH WILL ATTRACT NEW READERS. THEY HAVE TO
DIFFERENTIATE THEIR APPROACH ACCORDING TO THE READERS' AGE, EDUCATION,
PROFESSION AND/OR EMPLOYMENT, PUBLIC ACTIVITIES, SEX, FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES,
HOBBIES, ETC. WITH THE LIBRARIAN'S HELP READERS OUGHT TO ACQUIRE
'INDEPENDENCE' AND BE ABLE TO USE THE LIBRARIES BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES.
LIBRARIES IN EDUCATION' A REVIEW OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN GHANA.

DEMONSTRATES THE INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE OF SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND PUBLIC
LIBRARIES IN MEETING THE READING NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND THE EDUCATED PUBLIC IN
GHANA DUE TO INSUFFICIENT PROVISION OF FUNDS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, ABSENCE
OF READING HABITS IN GHANAIAN CULTURE, UNAWARENESS OF POTENTIAL VALUE OF
NON-BOOK MEDIA AS LEARNING RESOURCES AND UNSATISFACTORY TRAINING OF LIBRARY
STAFF. MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING FACILITIES AND PERFORMANCE OF
SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS WELL AS THE TRAINING OF STAFF.
BIBLIOMETRICS: ITS THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS.

THE TERM 'BIBLIOMETRICS' WAS COINED BY PRITCHARD IN 1969 TO REPLACE THE TERM
'STATISTICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY' BUT THE 1ST BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
MADE BY COLE AND EALES IN 1917 WHEN THEY CONDUCTED A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF
COMPARATIVE ANATOMY LITERATURE PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1550-1860. BIBLIOMETRIC DATA
CONFORM TO A NUMBER OF LAWS VIZ. BRADFORD'S LAW, LOTKA'S LAW, AND ZIPF'S LAW.
THE MAJOR SOURCES OF DATA ARE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND CITATIONS. BIBLIOMETRICS HAS
ITS APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELDS OF BOOK AND PERIODICAL SELECTION,
CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBJECT LITERATURE, EVALUATION OF COLLECTIONS AND
BIBLIOGRAPHIES, HISTORY, AND SOCIOLOGY.
THE SUCCESS-BREEDS-SUCCESS PHENOMENON AND BIBLIOMETRIC PROCESSES.

SUCCESS-BREEDS-SUCCESS PHENOMENON IS DESCRIBED BY SINGLE- AND MULTIPLE-URN
MODELS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THESE MODELS LEAD TO A NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SUCCESSES AND A ZIPF-MANDELBROT LAW FOR THE NUMBER OF
SOURCES CONTRIBUTING A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SUCCESSES.
ADJUSTED AGE DISTRIBUTION AND ITS APPLICATION TO IMPACT FACTOR AND IMMEDIACY
INDEX.

FOR THE AGE COUNT BETWEEN CITING AND CITED PAPERS, THE DIFFERENCE IN THE YEAR
OF PUBLICATION IS WIDELY USED. IN SOME CASES, THE FREQUENCY OBTAINED IS
INACCURATE BECAUSE OF AGE BIAS. DESCRIBES A PROBABILISTIC METHOD FOR ADJUSTING
THE RAW FREQUENCY, AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE IMPACT FACTOR AND IMMEDIACY
INDEX IN JOURNAL EVALUATION. THE MAIN PROCEDURE IS THAT &B OF THE RAW
FREQUENCY AT ANY GIVEN AGE IS ASSIGNED TO THE PREVIOUS AGE AND TO THE
FOLLOWING AGE, RESPECTIVELY. ADJUSTING THE FREQUENCY OVER ALL AGES OF USE, THE
CURVE REPRESENTING THE AGE DISTRIBUTION BECOMES SMOOTHER.
SPECIAL COLLECTIONS IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

THE SPECIAL COLLECTIONS INCLUDED IN THIS GUIDE COMPRISE THEMATICALLY RELATED
GROUPS OF MATERIAL MAINTAINED AS SEPARATE UNITS WITH THE GENERAL HOLDINGS OF
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. THEY WERE EITHER ACQUIRED AS A UNIT OR SPECIFICALLY
ASSEMBLED BY THE LIBRARY. ALTHOUGH VALUABLE RESOURCES, THESE COLLECTIONS ARE
OFTEN CHALLENGING TO USE AS THEY ARE NOT RECORDED IN A SINGLE CARD CATALOGUE
OR MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASE BUT RATHER IN A VARIETY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC GUIDES.
FURTHERMORE, SOME SPECIAL COLLECTIONS ARE SO VAST THAT IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO
PROVIDE AN ITEM-BY-ITEM LISTING. SEEKS TO GUIDE THE RESEARCHER TO RESOURCES
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OVERLOOKED AND DESCRIBES SPECIAL COLLECTIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN SINGLED OUT BY THE LIBRARY'S REFERENCE STAFF FOR THEIR RARITY OR
POTENTIAL INTEREST TO SCHOLARS AND SUMMARISES THE HISTORY, CONTENT, SCOPE,
SUBJECT STRENGTHS AND ORGANISATION OF THESE GROUPS OF MATERIALS. THOUGH
LIMITED TO 269 OF THE MANY SPECIAL COLLECTI ONS, IT ILLUSTRATES AN APPROACH
THAT CAN BE APPLIED FOR THE EFFECTIVE USE OF SIMILAR RESOURCES.
PUBLISHED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AS A SOURCE FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY HISTORY' A
CANADIAN CASE STUDY.

TAKEN AS A SINGLE CATEGORY, PUBLISHED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE THE
RICHEST AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION BASE FOR INVESTIGATING A COUNTRY'S
MODERN PAST. EXPLORES THE AVAILABILITY, RANGE, AND POTENTIAL USEFULNESS OF
PUBLISHED FEDERAL- AND PROVINCIAL-LEVEL CANADIAN GOVERNMENT SOURCES TO 1925,
PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THOSE MATERIALS MOST LIKELY TO BE USEFUL FOR
INVESTIGATING CONDITIONS AND BEHAVIOUR OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.
CONSIDERATIONS IN STATE DOCUMENT COLLECTION BUILDING.

LISTS QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DEVELOPING A COLLECTION OF US STATE
DOCUMENTS IN THE LIGHT OF POSSIBLE REDUCTIONS IN STATE PUBLISHING PROGRAMMES
AND PRESENTS PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A NATIONWIDE SURVEY ABOUT TYPES OF
STATE DOCUMENTS MOST USEFUL FOR REFERENCE USE.
ACCESS TO FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IN SMALL NON-DEPOSITORY ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

50 SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES NOT HOUSING FEDERAL DEPOSITORIES WERE SURVEYED TO
DETERMINE HOW WELL THEY CAN MEET USERS' NEEDS FOR FEDERAL DOCUMENTS. RESULTS
INDICATE THESE LIBRARIES SPEND AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT $750 A YEAR ON DOCUMENTS,
ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE FREE MATERIAL, AND INCORPORATE MOST DOCUMENTS INTO THE
REGULAR COLLECTION OR THE VERTICAL FILE. ALTHOUGH MOST ACQUIRE THE BASIC
DOCUMENT REFERENCE SOURCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS, VERY FEW MAKE ANY
SIGNIFICANT USE OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN. APPARENTLY MOST CANNOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO
DOCUMENTS EQUAL TO THAT OFFERED BY EVEN SMALL DEPOSITORIES.
LIBRARIES AND COLLECTIONS-THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.

THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY (AAS) IS A LEARNED SOCIETY FOUNDED IN 1812 IN
WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS. THE SOCIETY MAINTAINS A RESEARCH LIBRARY OF AMERICAN
HISTORY AND CULTURE IN ORDER TO COLLECT, PRESERVE AND MAKE AVAILABLE FOR STUDY
THE PRINTED RECORD OF THE USA. WITH HOLDINGS NUMBERING CLOSE TO 3 MILLION
BOOKS, PAMPHLETS, BROADSIDES, MANUSCRIPTS, PRINTS, MAPS AND NEWSPAPERS, THIS
LIBRARY PRESERVES THE LARGEST SINGLE COLLECTION OF PRINTED SOURCE MATERIAL
RELATING TO THE HISTORY, LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF THE USA.
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD CENTRES: A DECADE OF PROGRESS?.

IN 1977, THE MUSEUMS ASSOCIATION CONVENED A STANDING COMMITTEE ON
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD CENTRES. DESCRIBES THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE, AND
PRESENTS A RESUME OF THE CURRENT STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDING IN THE UK.
IT INCLUDES COVERAGE OF WORK WITHIN 6 MAIN SUBJECT GROUPS (ARCHAEOLOGY,
GEOLOGY, HISTORIC BUILDINGS, SOCIAL HISTORY, INDUSTRIAL HISTORY AND BIOLOGY).
LOCAL COLLECTIONS IN BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE LIBRARIAN IN CHARGE OF LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS IN UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES
COLLECTIONS WILL NEED TO SCAN LOCAL PAPERS AND JOURNALS FOR REFERENCES TO
LOCAL EVENTS AND FOR REVIEWS OF BOOKS AND OTHER MATERIAL OF INTEREST. HE
SHOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH LOCAL FIRMS AND ASSOCIATIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN
THEIR PUBLICATIONS AND SCAN THE SALES CATALOGUES OF SECOND-HAND BOOKSELLERS
AND AUCTIONEERS FOR OUT-OF-PRINT MATERIAL. THE MAIN PROBLEM FACING LOCAL
COLLECTIONS IS THE LACK OF QUALIFIED STAFF, WITHOUT WHICH THE LIBRARY CANNOT
PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF INTERESTED ENQUIRERS.
ON THE CONVENTION CIRCUIT.

REPORT ON A CONFERENCE FOR SERIALS LIBRARIANS, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, 30-31 OCT
81, THE 1ST OF A SERIES PLANNED AND SPONSORED BY ALAN MECKLER, PRESIDENT OF
MICROFORM REVIEW, INC. PAPERS COVERED' THE JOURNAL IN THE YEAR 2000; AACR2;
AUTOMATED SERIALS SYSTEMS; STANDARDISATION; INDEXES AND ABSTRACTS; THE CONCEPT
OF A NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTRE; AND SERIALS DEPARTMENTS.
PERIODICALS IN OUR LIBRARIES.

PERIODICALS ARE VALUABLE IN EVERY LIBRARY SINCE THEY ARE TOPICAL MATERIAL AND
ATTRACT NEW READERS WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE USE THE LIBRARY. PERIODICAL
SELECTION IS IMPORTANT; A LIST IS INCLUDED OF 42 GERMAN LANGUAGE PERIODICALS
ON ALL SUBJECTS, FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED SUITABLE
FOR A ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH LIBRARY. PERIODICAL SELECTION BY A TEAM IS
ESSENTIAL; THE TEAM COULD INCLUDE THE PRIEST, THE PARISH COUNCIL AND
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. SELECTION SHOULD TAKE PARTICULAR
COMMUNITY INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT BUT EXCESSIVE SPECIALISATION SHOULD BE
AVOIDED. FINANCE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM; SOME INDIVIDUAL READERS MIGHT BE WILLING
TO HELP. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY'S PERIODICAL STOCKS.
AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DENSITY-OF-USE RANKING AND RAW USE
RANKING OF LIBRARY JOURNAL USE.

REPORTS OF JOURNAL TITLES RANKED BY USE WITH SPACE AND COST INFORMATION
INCLUDED FOR EACH TITLE CAN PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MAKING CERTAIN OBJECTIVE
JOURNAL COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED IN
RELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THAT
DECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BY
RAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TO
ALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THE
COLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BY
THE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'
FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE
RANK' (DUR) IS FORMED. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUR AND DUR HAVE BEEN
ANALYSED.
THE NEW CITY ARCHIVES IN RIO DE JANEIRO.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW CITY ARCHIVES OF RIO DE JANEIRO, BASED ON A PERSONAL
VISIT IN 1979. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE STRUCTURE AND LAYOUT; ALLOCATION OF
SPACE TO STORAGE, WORKSHOPS, AND PUBLIC FACILITIES; AND GENERAL TECHNICAL
CHARACTERISTICS. SOME COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES ARE MADE, AND AN
ACCOUNT GIVEN OF SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST THE CLIMATE AND
FIRE.
NON-ADMINISTRATIVE USERS OF ARCHIVES IN FRANCE.

REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT IN 1980 BY THE ASSOCIATION OF FRENCH ARCHIVISTS.
ITS 2 MAIN SECTIONS COMPRISE A GENERAL REPORT ON THE STATE AND ACTIVITIES OF
THE ASSOCIATION AS A WHOLE, AND 5 SPECIAL REPORTS FROM EACH OF THE ASSOCIATION
SECTIONS, DEALING WITH THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, THE ARCHIVES OF CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, REGIONAL ARCHIVES, MUNICIPAL ARCHIVES, AND BUSINESS
ARCHIVES. ALL 6 REPORTS ARE PRESENTED IN A STANDARD FORMAT, COVERING USER
CHARACTERISTICS, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, AND ARCHIVE SERVICES. THE OVERALL
PICTURE SHOWS AN EXPLOSIVE INCREASE IN THE USE OF ARCHIVE SEARCH ROOMS SINCE
1956, CAUSED BY INCREASING NUMBERS OF 'OCCASIONAL' USERS, WHILE THE NUMBER OF
ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS HAS DECREASED.
RECOMMENDED REFERENCE SOURCES FOR SCHOOL MEDIA CENTERS.

ANNOTATED LIST OF SELECTED REFERENCE WORKS INTENDED AS A COLLECTION BUILDING
AID FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND MEDIA SPECIALISTS. ORIGINALLY PREPARED FOR THE
SCHOOLS OF POLK COUNTY, FLORIDA, THE BIBLIOGRAPHY IS LIMITED TO POST 1979
MATERIALS.
GAMES IN THE LIBRARY.

GAMES CAN PROMOTE SOCIAL CONTACT AND DEVELOP POWERS OF THINKING AND
CONCENTRATION. A MINIMUM STOCK OF 20-50 GAMES IS RECOMMENDED, INCLUDING GAMES
FOR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, LOGIC AND WORD GAMES AND GAMES ENCOURAGING
LEARNING AND QUICK THINKING. THEY CAN BE ARRANGED FLAT ON SHELVES OR PLACED ON
TABLES. ADVICE ON PROCESSING AND CATALOGUING IS INCLUDED. EACH GAME SHOULD BE
CHECKED THOROUGHLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LOAN; MANUFACTURERS WILL USUALLY SUPPLY
SPARE PARTS IF A GAME IS STILL IN PRODUCTION. THE PRESENCE OF GAMES IN THE
LIBRARY SHOULD BE WIDELY ADVERTISED BY PUBLICITY LEAFLETS, NOTICES IN THE
PRESS AND, SINCE CHILDREN ARE THE MAIN GAMES USERS, BY CONTACT WITH YOUTH
GROUPS AND KINDERGARTENS. ORGANISATION BY THE LIBRARY OF REGULAR GAMES
AFTERNOONS OFTEN PROVES POPULAR.
AUDIO-VISUAL DEVELOPMENTS RELEVANT TO LIBRARIES.

MOST ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY ALREADY HAVE MANY AUDIO-VISUAL (AV)
AIDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL' MICROFILMS, SOUND RECORDINGS IN VARIOUS FORMS, MAPS,
POSTERS AND INDIVIDUAL CUBICLES FOR LISTENING TO SOUND RECORDINGS. TODAY THE
MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF AV AIDS IN LIBRARIES IS NOT THE INTRODUCTION OF EVERY
AVAILABLE NEW AV DEVELOPMENT INTO THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A MEDIA SECTION IN THE LIBRARY WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS
WITHIN THE LIBRARY E.G. THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT. NEW DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS
VIEWDATA, VIDEO, CABLE TELEVISION AND COMPUTER LEARNING AIDS CANNOT BE
AUTOMATICALLY INTEGRATED INTO LIBRARIES. VARIOUS FACTORS MUST BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION WHEN SELECTING A NEW AV AID FOR A LIBRARY; THE INFORMATION
VALUE, ECONOMIC ASPECTS, AND THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL STAFF TRAINING WHICH
WILL BE NECESSARY TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE AIDS.
THE USE OF MICROFORMS IN LIBRARIES.

DISCUSSES BOTH MANAGEMENT AND DOCUMENTATION APPLICATIONS IN LIBRARIES IN VIEW
OF THE INCREASING USE OF ALL TYPES OF MICROFORMS. THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROFORMS
ARE FIRST SUMMARISED, THEN DETAILS GIVEN OF HOW THEY ARE EMPLOYED IN LOAN
SYSTEMS SUCH AS PHOTOCHARGING; AND IN CATALOGUES, WHETHER OPEN OR CLOSED, AS
MICROFILMS OR MICROFICHES. THE FIELD OF MICRODOCUMENTATION IS THEN CONSIDERED
AT LENGTH. ALL ASPECTS OF MICROREPRODUCTION ARE SURVEYED' MICROFORMS AS PART
OF GENERAL DOCUMENTATION, SYSTEMATIC MICROREPRODUCTION OF HOLDINGS, PRIVATE
REPRODUCTION, MICROFORMS IN INTERLIBRARY LOAN, AND TYPES OF MICROFORMS IN USE;
APPLICATIONS IN MICRO-PUBLISHING ARE NEXT DISCUSSED. IN CONCLUSION THE
PROBLEMS WHICH MICROFORMS RAISE IN LIBRARIES ARE EXAMINED, BOTH IN PRODUCING
THEM AND IN EXPLOITING THEM FULLY.
THE TECHNOLOGY OF MICROGRAPHIC PRODUCTION.

SURVEYS THE POINTS ESSENTIAL FOR CONSIDERATION PRELIMINARY TO SELECTING
MICROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. DISCUSSES THE QUALITY OF MICROFORMS' WHY THIS IS
IMPORTANT, STANDARDISATION, AND WAYS AND MEANS OF CONTROLLING QUALITY;
PRODUCTION' THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF USING OUTSIDE
AGENCIES OR ESTABLISHING A LABORATORY WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, TAKING SHOTS,
DEVELOPING FILM, AND STORAGE METHODS; AND CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES.
MICROGRAPHY IN THE DOCUMENTATION FIELD. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT.

A PRACTICAL PROGRAMME FOR INTRODUCING MICROGRAPHY INTO AN ALREADY EXISTING
COLLECTION. THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROGRAPHY IN THE DOCUMENTATION FIELD ARE
DISCUSSED, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CURRENT OBJECTIONS TO ITS USE, AND
STRATEGY FOR CIRCUMVENTING OPPOSITION SUMMARISED IN 5 PRECEPTS. EXAMINES' WHAT
DOCUMENTS TO SELECT FOR COPYING; WHAT KIND OF MICROFORM TO USE; HOW TO PREPARE
DOCUMENTS FOR COPYING; PRODUCTION OF MICROFORMS; SELECTION OF A MICROFORM
READER; AND EXPLOITATION OF MICROFORM HOLDINGS.
MICROFORMS' THE TREND OF APPLICATIONS (IN CHINESE).

REVIEWS MICROFORM DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY RELATE TO LIBRARY APPLICATIONS.
DISCUSSES MICROFORM AS AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION MEDIUM AND THE TREND OF ITS
BROAD APPLICATIONS, THE INDEXING METHODS AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
MICROFORMS AS LIBRARY TOOLS.

DESCRIBES WHAT IS MEANT BY MICROPUBLISHING AND OUTLINES THE BENEFITS OF
MICROFORMS AS LIBRARY MEDIA INCLUDING REDUCED PRINTING COSTS, QUICKER
DISSEMINATION, EASIER RETRIEVAL, SPACE SAVING, EASE OF HANDLING, FILE
UNIFORMITY, INCREASED DURABILITY AND RAPID UPDATING. DISCUSSES THE NATURE OF,
AND ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF MICROFORM.
USE OF MICROFILM IN FRENCH PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES. THIRTY-FIVE YEARS' EXPERIENCE.

FOLLOWING A PRELIMINARY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF MICROFILM IN
FRENCH PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES AND ITS GRADUAL INTEGRATION INTO NORMAL ARCHIVE
MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCE TO THE ELABORATION OF OFFICIAL NORMS AND
REGULATIONS FOR USE, STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC
SERVICE IS GIVEN, SHOWING PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN WORKSHOP SPACE, SPECIALIST
PERSONNEL EMPLOYED, AND MICROFILM FOOTAGE PRODUCTION, WITH REFERENCE TO
RELEVANT STATE PUBLICATIONS. THE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMME OF DUPLICATING
IMPORTANT HOLDINGS IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND COMMENTS MADE ON ATTITUDES IN
GENERAL TO USE OF MICROFILM, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. CONCLUDES THAT TO MAINTAIN
EFFICIENCY, THE FRENCH ARCHIVE SERVICE NEEDS TO KEEP ABREAST OF TECHNOLOGICAL
DEVELOPMENT, SECURE ITS FINANCIAL BASIS, AND SOLVE THE LEGAL PROBLEMS OF
REPROGRAPHY.
STANDARDS FOR SPEAKERS.

A PROPER SOUND SYSTEM IS A CRITICAL CONSIDERATION FOR ALL AUDIO LIBRARIANS AND
ARCHIVISTS. PRESENTS GUIDELINES FOR SPEAKER SELECTION TO PRODUCE THE MOST
AUTHENTIC REPRODUCTION. SPEAKERS SHOULD' HAVE A WIDE FREQUENCY
RANGE-APPROXIMATELY 25-16,000 HERTZ OR BETTER; HAVE A FLAT RESPONSE-03 DB OR
LESS; HAVE LOW INTERMODULATION DISTORTION-0.5% OR LESS; HAVE MINIMAL
DIFFERENCES IN SPEAKER ARRIVAL TIME-1 MILLISECOND OR LESS; AND BE PROPERLY
PLACED FOR BEST RESPONSE.
ARCHIVES APPEAL TO THE RECORD MANUFACTURERS.

AT THE JOINT CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOUND ARCHIVES AND
THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUSIC LIBRARIES, CAMBRIDGE, 1980, THEIR JOINT
AGREEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED ON RECORD SLEEVES BY
RECORD MANUFACTURERS WAS DISCUSSED. IF THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED, A
RECORD'S VALUE AS AN ACADEMIC SOURCE INCREASES. THE INFORMATION SHOULD
INCLUDE' THE DATE OF RECORDING; THE PLACE OF RECORDING; NAMES OF PUBLISHERS,
ARRANGERS AND STATEMENTS ON ABBREVIATIONS OR DEVIATIONS IN THE SCORE; NAMES OF
PERFORMERS; PLAYING TIME FOR EACH SECTION; NAMES OF CONDUCTORS, SOUND
ENGINEERS AND PRODUCERS. THE AGREEMENT IS BEING DISCUSSED WITH MANUFACTURERS
IN GERMANY, FRANCE, SCANDINAVIA AND THE UK.
ORAL ARCHIVES' SOME REFLECTIONS ON CREATING THEM.

DESCRIBES METHODS USED IN THE PRIVATE ARCHIVES DEPARTMENT OF THE FRENCH
NATIONAL ARCHIVES FOR RECORDING ORAL TESTIMONIES. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
EQUIPMENT USED, WITH PRACTICAL ADVICE ON CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO ENSURE GOOD
QUALITY RECORDINGS, AND RELEVANT CONTENT WITH MINIMUM FATIGUE FOR THE
PARTICIPANTS. THE ESSENTIAL PRELIMINARY DATA TO BE RECORDED ON EVERY TAPE FOR
ARCHIVE IDENTIFICATION ARE LISTED. THE IMPORTANCE OF ORAL TESTIMONIES IN
SUPPLEMENTING AND EXPLAINING THE CONTENTS OF TRADITIONAL ARCHIVES IS
ILLUSTRATED HERE WITH REFERENCE TO A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS RECORDED FROM
DESCENDANTS OF FRENCH POLITICIANS IN THE COURSE OF A SURVEY OF THEIR PERSONAL
PAPERS.
LIBRARIES AND COMPUTER MATERIALS.

THE SEMINAR HELD AT DORKING, 13-14 MAR 81, DISCUSSED THE IMPLICATIONS FOR
LIBRARIES OF THE RAPID GROWTH IN THE SCOPE AND VARIETY OF COMPUTER MATERIALS,
ESPECIALLY MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE. EXPLORED THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE
LIBRARY/INFORMATION PROFESSIONS TO SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING,
INDEXING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH MATERIALS.
NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALS AS A FIELD OF STUDY-THE STATE OF THE ART.

THE AUTHOR RECENTLY COMPILED AN INVENTORY OF NORTH AFRICAN JEWISH PERIODICALS
FOUND IN 4 MAJOR JERUSALEM COLLECTIONS. WHILE PREPARING THIS 1ST LISTING OF
145 TITLES, HE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL PROBLEMS, WHICH HE SHARES WITH LIBRARIANS.
FIRSTLY, THERE WERE OFTEN DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN HOLDINGS LISTED IN THE
CATALOGUE AND ACTUAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH ONLY A FIRST-HAND CHECK OF EACH ISSUE
COULD RECTIFY. MOREOVER, THE CATALOGUE IS NOT A SATISFACTORY SOURCE FOR
CHANGES OF EDITORS, MANAGERS-OR EVEN SUBTITLES AND OTHER TITLES (OFTEN
APPEARING IN OTHER LANGUAGES). THE CENTRAL ZIONIST ARCHIVES POSED A SPECIAL
PROBLEM' NEWSPAPERS AS A RULE ARE TRANSFERRED TO ITS LIBRARY COLLECTION, BUT
SOME ISSUES OF SHORT-LIVED ZIONIST PERIODICALS WERE APPENDED TO CORRESPONDENCE
AND REMAIN IN THE ARCHIVAL COLLECTION, WITHOUT BEING LISTED IN THE LIBRARY
CATALOGUE.
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF GERMAN AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE; SELECTED EXAMPLES. PART 2.

A DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN
THE USA, THE HIGH STANDARDS OF RESEARCH INTO THE SUBJECT AND THE CONCERN TO
RAISE THE STANDARD OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. THE CHILDREN'S SERVICE DIVISION
OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS ORGANISED SERVICES TO HELP THE
BACKWARD AND UNDERPRIVILEGED BY BRINGING THEM INTO CONTACT WITH GOOD
LITERATURE. THE BEST BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER REFERENCE BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT
ARE DISCUSSED. BRIEFER SURVEYS ARE ALSO INCLUDED ON THE PUBLISHING OF
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, PAST AND PRESENT, AND ON LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN IN
CANADA, SWEDEN, PANAMA, SPAIN, BRAZIL, CHILE, AUSTRALIA, EGYPT, GHANA, ISRAEL
AND TURKEY. FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 82/5467.
NORMS AND FUNCTIONS IN CITATION' THE VIEW OF JOURNAL EDITORS AND REFEREES IN
PSYCHOLOGY.

THE VIEWS OF PSYCHOLOGY JOURNAL EDITORS AND EDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS
WERE SOUGHT ON THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CITATION. INFORMATION WAS GATHERED
USING AN 18 ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE. THE FEELING EMERGED THAT CITATION WAS A SKILL
WHICH AUTHORS ACQUIRED OSMOTICALLY. CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT WAS GIVEN TO THE IDEA
THAT EDITORS AND REFEREES COULD PLAY A MORE POSITIVE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING AND
ENCOURAGING CONSISTENCY IN AUTHORS' CITATION PRACTICES. WHERE APPROPRIATE,
REPLIES HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF PREVAILING THEORY. PRACTICAL
REASONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
THE CODEX CAESAREUS UPSALIENSIS.

DESCRIBES A MANUSCRIPT, CONTAINING THE 4 GOSPELS IN LATIN WHICH WAS PRODUCED
IN 1050 BY THE MONASTERY OF ECHTERNACH ON THE ORDER OF EMPEROR HENRY III AND
THEN SENT TO THE MONASTERY OF GOSLAR; IN 1632, DURING THE 30 YEARS' WAR, IT
WAS TAKEN AS WAR BOOTY TO SWEDEN AND IN 1805 WAS GIVEN TO UPPSALA UNIVERSITY.
IN 1971 A FACSIMILE EDITION OF 500 COPIES WAS PRODUCED TO CELEBRATE THE 350TH
ANNIVERSARY OF UPPSALA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
PRODUCTION METHODS FOR THESE FACSIMILES IS INCLUDED. EACH COPY IS ACCOMPANIED
BY A COMPREHENSIVE ESSAY ON THE MANUSCRIPT BY CARL NORDENFALK, AN
INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY ON MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS.
SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY. (IV) RELIGIOUS CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY.

THE RANGE OF CASSETTES ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET IS
RELATIVELY SMALL. SOME RELIGIOUS MATERIAL IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON RECORDS, WHICH
ARE LESS USEFUL THAN CASSETTES IN LIBRARIES, BUT THE PRODUCTS OF A FEW
IMPORTANT MANUFACTURERS SHOULD FORM THE BASIS OF A LIBRARY'S STOCK.
MANUFACTURERS' LISTS PROVIDE THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE LIBRARIAN
SINCE NO COMPREHENSIVE TOPICAL INDEX OF RELIGIOUS CASSETTES EXISTS. CASSETTE
MATERIAL AVAILABLE IN GERMANY CONTAINING BIBLE READINGS AND DRAMATISATIONS,
TALKS ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH, THE CHRISTIAN WAY OF LIFE, MEDITATION AND PRAYER
IS DESCRIBED. EACH CASSETTE SHOULD BE EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY CONCERNING ITS
SUBJECT CONTENT, AIMS, SUITABILITY FOR THE TARGET GROUP AND THE QUALITY OF
MUSIC, LANGUAGE AND TECHNICAL PRODUCTION. (FOR PREVIOUS PARTS, SEE 82/5287,
82/5291 AND 82/5288).
THE LOMENIE DE BRIENNE COLLECTION AND OTHER FRENCH LEGAL DOCUMENTS AT HARVARD.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES HOLDINGS IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES OF HISTORICAL
FRENCH LEGAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE LOMENIE DE BRIENNE COLLECTION, AND
CATALOGUES OF THE HOLDINGS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE DOCUMENTS SERVED A NEWS
FUNCTION AND WERE DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE LEGAL CIRCLES.
CENTRALISATION AND TREATMENT OF MAIL, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND ARCHIVES'
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GENEVA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROCEDURES ADOPTED FOLLOWING THE CONCENTRATION OF ALL
SERVICES IN ONE BUILDING. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SYSTEM EVOLVED FOR HANDLING
BOTH CURRENT AND SPECIAL MAIL, SPECIFYING ROUTINES FOR DEALING WITH
COMMUNICATIONS FROM STATE DEPARTMENTS; THE TASKS ASSIGNED TO THE DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE; AND ARCHIVE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO SUBJECT FIELDS COVERED, SHOWING
HOW UDC IS USED. ARCHIVE CRITERIA FOR CONSERVATION AND DESTRUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS, AND USE OF MICROFILMING, ARE DESCRIBED, AND CATALOGUING TECHNIQUES
AND EQUIPMENT USED FOR 16MM MICROFILMING SPECIFIED. RELEVANT STANDARD
DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES IS APPENDED TO
ILLUSTRATE THE SYSTEM.
AUTHOR COCITATION: A LITERATURE MEASURE OF INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE.

SHOWS THAT THE MAPPING OF A PARTICULAR AREA OF SCIENCE, IN THIS CASE
INFORMATION SCIENCE, CAN BE DONE USING AUTHORS AS UNITS OF ANALYSIS AND THE
COCITATIONS OF PAIRS OF AUTHORS AS THE VARIABLE THAT INDICATES THEIR
'DISTANCES' FROM EACH OTHER. THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES THAT THE MORE 2 AUTHORS ARE
CITED TOGETHER, THE CLOSER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. THE RAW DATA ARE
COCITATION COUNTS DRAWN ON-LINE FROM SOCIAL SCISEARCH (2SOCIAL SCIENCES
CITATION INDEX1) OVER THE PERIOD 1972-79. COCITATION ANALYSIS OF AUTHORS
OFFERS A NEW TECHNIQUE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF
INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE IN THE SCIENCES AND POSSIBLY IN OTHER AREAS TO THE
EXTENT THAT THOSE AREAS RELY ON SERIAL PUBLICATIONS.
COINCIDENCE METHODS AND THE TWO-LEVEL CONCEPT.

COINCIDENCE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO RANK DISTRIBUTION IN
THE REPORT LITERATURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM (INIS)
AND A 2-LEVEL CONCEPT USED FOR DISCUSSION OF RESULTS IN THE PRESENT AND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATION
LEVELS, WITH REFERENCE TO CONSTANT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, ARE COMPARED WITH
EACH OTHER AS WELL AS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AT
CONSTANT LEVELS. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 'INFORMATION AVALANCHE' FOR THE
HIGHLY SPECIALISED INFORMATION SCIENTIST, THE GREATER EFFECTIVITY OF REPORT
LITERATURE AS COMPARED WITH PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN THE FIELDS OF NUCLEAR
RESEARCH AND THE NONCOMPATIBILITY OF MACRO AND MICRO INFORMATION LEVELS CAN BE
QUANTITATIVELY CONFIRMED. THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOW MICROLEVEL DISTRIBUTION
CAN BE CHANGED INTO MACROLEVEL DISTRIBUTION.
PATTERNS OF JOURNAL USE IN A DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY' A CITATION ANALYSIS.

CITATION ANALYSIS OF FACULTY PUBLICATIONS, DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS, AND
PRELIMINARY DOCTORAL QUALIFYING BRIEFS PRODUCED BY FACULTY AND STUDENTS OF THE
BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, IS USED TO ASSESS JOURNAL USE IN THE
BIOLOGY LIBRARY DURING THE YEARS 1975-77. THERE ARE 3,739 CITATIONS TO 336
JOURNALS IN THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING. THE DISTRIBUTION OF CITATIONS IN
EACH USER GROUP RANKING AND THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING TAKES THE FORM OF A
BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION. 60 HIGHLY CITED TITLES ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL.
DISSERTATION CITATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON ACTIVE FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN THE
DOCTORAL PROGRAMME. CITATIONS IN QUALIFYING BRIEFS COVER A BROADER RANGE OF
TOPICS AND INTERESTS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER 2 SOURCES. CITATION FREQUENCIES
OF VOLUMES PUBLISHED IN THE PERIODS 1960-69 AND 1970-77 ARE EXAMINED. SEVERAL
COLLECTION MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE, BASED ON THE
RESULTS OF THIS STUDY. CITATION ANALYSIS IS SHOWN TO BE A USEFUL TOOL IN
ASSESSING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL JOURNAL USE BY A HETEROGENEOUS CLIENTELE IN A
DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.
THE USE OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN A NORWEGIAN DENTAL LIBRARY.

PERIODICAL LOANS, PHOTOCOPY REQUESTS, AND READING ROOM USE OF BACK VOLUMES OF
PERIODICALS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN DENTAL SCHOOL LIBRARY WERE REGISTERED
DURING A 12 MONTH PERIOD. LOANS WERE SORTED BY TITLE AND YEAR, AND TITLES WERE
GROUPED BY SPECIALITY AND LANGUAGE. TOTAL BORROWING WAS 2,242 AND THE ANNUAL
AGING FACTOR WAS 0.89 (HALF-LIFE 5.8 YEARS). 12 PERIODICALS ACCOUNTED FOR 50%
OF TOTAL BORROWING. WHILE MOST SPECIALISED DENTAL JOURNALS HAD A LOWER AGING
FACTOR THAN DENTAL JOURNALS AS A WHOLE, ORTHODONTIC JOURNALS HAD AN AGING
FACTOR OF 0.92 (HALF-LIFE 8.7 YEARS). NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE JOURNALS ACCOUNTED
FOR 22% OF BORROWING, SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGE TITLES (16% OF BORROWING) HAD A
LOWER AGING FACTOR (0.87, HALF-LIFE 5.1 YEARS) AND SEEMED TO BE USED MORE AS
NEWS JOURNALS.
BULGARIAN AND FOREIGN LITERATURE ON ENERGY IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
BULGARIA.

A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF LITERATURE ON ENERGY, AVAILABLE AT PRESENT, IN
BULGARIAN LIBRARIES. ALL POSSIBLE ASPECTS ARE COVERED. FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS IN
THIS IMPORTANT FIELD WERE PREDOMINANTLY FRENCH AND GERMAN IN THE 1940S, BUT
NOWADAYS, 60% IS WRITTEN IN RUSSIAN FOLLOWED BY MATERIALS IN ENGLISH. DURING
THE PAST 20 YEARS, EVEN THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES HAVE ESTABLISHED
SPECIAL COLLECTIONS ON ENERGY. MAJOR LIBRARIES HAVE SPECIALISED IN 3 AREAS.
FIRSTLY, THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE BULGARIAN
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAVE BUILT UP THEORETICAL COLLECTIONS AND OTHERS OF
SPECIALIST INTEREST, E.G. ON NUCLEAR ENERGY. SECONDLY, REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS
ARE TO BE FOUND MAINLY AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY WHILE
THIRDLY TECHNICAL COLLEGES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS OF HIGHER TECHNICAL
EDUCATION CONCENTRATE ON ALL ASPECTS OF ELECTRICAL POWER, INSTALLATIONS,
INSTRUMENTS, AND SO ON. IN ALL LIBRARIES, THE STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW
ACQUISITIONS MUST BEAR IN MIND THE LATEST TRENDS, E.G. CONVERSION OF CHEMICAL
ENERGY INTO LIGHT, WHERE, SO FAR, THE LITERATURE AVAILABLE IS ALMOST
NEGLIGIBLE.
THE UNIVERSITY IS A SCHOOL OF READING.

STUDENTS AT THE STUDENCHESKOE KONSTRUKTORSKOE BYURO AVIAMODELIZMA, (STUDENTS'
AIRCRAFT MODELLING CONSTRUCTION BUREAU), START BY READING THE LITERATURE ON A
PROBLEM; THE ROAD TO SCIENCE STARTS IN THE LIBRARY. THE UNIVERSITY COURSE ON
STUDENTS' EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH WORK INCULCATES THE READING HABIT, INDEPENDENT
WORK WITH BOOKS. FOR BEST RESULTS STUDENTS SHOULD ABSTRACT THE IMPORTANT PARTS
OF THEIR READING, THINKING IT OVER UNHURRIEDLY. CREATIVE INTERACTION WITH THE
TEXT IS MOST IMPORTANT. AFTER LECTURES, THE NEXT STAGE IS THE LIBRARY,
FOLLOWING UP POINTS MADE IN THE LECTURES. TACTFUL LIBRARIANS HELP READERS
CHOOSE A BOOK AT THEIR LEVEL OF COMPETENCE AND, IN A SHORT CONVERSATION, CAN
AROUSE STRONG INTEREST IN A BOOK OR, CONVERSELY, SWITCH A READER OVER TO AN
ALTERNATIVE CHOICE.
THE FILMING OF COMPLETE MUSICAL STOCKS OF HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE IN SMALLER
LIBRARIES NOT GENERALLY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, CARRIED OUT BY THE GERMAN MUSIC
HISTORY ARCHIVE IN KASSEL.

MUCH OF THE VALUABLE OLD MANUSCRIPT AND PRINTED MUSIC IN GERMANY IS NOT OWNED
BY THE STATE AND ONLY FOUND IN SMALL ARCHIVES IN CASTLES, MONASTERIES,
CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION, THE
ARCHIVE IS WORKING IN NORTH GERMANY, MICROFILMING THESE MUSICAL TREASURES,
CATALOGUING THEM AND THEN MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. IMPORTANT
COLLECTIONS RECENTLY COVERED INCLUDE' MUSIC IN LUBECK PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM THE
17TH CENTURY NORTH GERMAN SCHOOL OF ORGAN MUSIC AND ITS 18TH CENTURY
SUCCESSORS; 18TH CENTURY MUSIC BELONGING TO A NOBLE FAMILY IN EUTIN; 17TH AND
18TH CENTURY MUSIC IN A SCHOOL IN JEVER. THESE COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN
MICROFILMED AND ARE NOW BEING CATALOGUED.
THE HANDICAPPED AND MUSIC: THE ROLE OF MUSIC LIBRARIES?.

THE DISABLED LIVING FOUNDATION HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH UK MUSIC LIBRARIES IN
RECENT YEARS TO PROVIDE AN ADVISORY SERVICE ON MUSIC FOR THE HANDICAPPED;
DANISH MUSIC LIBRARIES ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN THIS SPHERE. THE 60 MUSIC LIBRARIES
IN GERMANY HAVE SO FAR DONE LITTLE FOR THE HANDICAPPED; THEY SHOULD OBTAIN ALL
AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM THE UK AND DISCUSS WITH LIBRARIANSHIP AND
GOVERNMENT BODIES THE ADAPTATION OF THE UK SCHEME FOR GERMANY. THE GERMAN
LIBRARY INSTITUTE COULD ORGANISE A PILOT PROJECT FOR 1983-84. TOPICS TO BE
CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF MUSIC IN HOSPITALS, DAY CENTRES AND
SCHOOLS, THE USE OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BY THE HANDICAPPED, THE PRODUCTION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIES, THE IMPROVEMENT OF SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE HANDICAPPED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
WHAT BOOKS DO PEOPLE NEED?.

SINCE LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE WELL EDUCATED, THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THAT
THEY MAY CATER SOLELY FOR THE WISHES OF AN ELITE MINORITY AND, BY EXCLUDING
EPHEMERAL LITERATURE FROM STOCK, DISCOURAGE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FROM USING THE
LIBRARY. THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLAN OF 1973 STATES CLEARLY THAT
LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR EVERYONE, EVEN IF PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY LIMITED
BUDGETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EMPHEMERAL LITERATURE HAS A RELAXING
EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE STIMULATING EFFECT CAUSED BY MORE
DEMANDING WORKS. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE LESS VALUABLE
MATERIAL, SUCH AS WORKS INVOLVING PORNOGRAPHY AND VIOLENCE AND THEN TO INCLUDE
SOME TRIVIA IF CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF READER STRUCTURE DEMANDS IT.
HOW CAN YOUR SON BECOME A READER?.

THE MOSCOW AND TUL'SK PAEDAGOGIC INSTITUTES RECENTLY INVESTIGATED
SCHOOLCHILDREN'S WANING INTEREST IN FICTION AND FOUND ELEMENTARY
SCHOOLCHILDREN READ LITTLE AND WERE INDIFFERENT TO FICTION. THE
EXTRA-CURRICULAR READING PROJECT FOR 1ST TO 3RD FORMS EVOLVED. HERE CHILDREN
LEARN TO EXAMINE BOOKS CAREFULLY BEFORE DECIDING ON SELECTION. AFTER 6 MONTHS
OF THIS INSTRUCTION, 65% OF 1ST-FORMERS WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO FIND THE BOOKS
REQUIRED. THE METHOD IS SUPPLEMENTED BY READING ALOUD STORIES ABOUT THE TEXT,
LITERARY GAMES, COMPETITIONS, ETC. THE AIM IS TO FAMILIARISE 1ST TO
3RD-FORMERS WITH SOME OF THE BEST RUSSIAN, SOVIET AND FOREIGN LITERATURE.
LIBRARIANS SHOULD CONSOLIDATE ON THESE EARLIEST SCHOOL READING HABITS. SCHOOL
LIBRARY COORDINATION IS NECESSARY.
POPULATION AND ITS STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION AS THE DETERMINING FACTOR FOR
LOCATION OF LIBRARIES AND THEIR WORK.

A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE 1980 POPULATION CENSUS AS TO CHANGES IN DENSITY,
SEX, AGE, EMPLOYMENT AND NATIONALITY, MAINLY IN THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC,
OFFERING IT AS A BASIS FOR THE FUTURE PLANNING OF LIBRARIES.
THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (1)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, OCT 80. LIBRARY
SERVICES MUST REACT AND DEVELOP IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CHANGE. THEY MUST CATER
FOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE TOWN AND COUNTRY
PLANNING HAS SO OFTEN FAILED. WORKING HOURS ARE SHORTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST,
SO LIBRARIES MUST DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL READING
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASS MEDIA. CHILDREN USE LIBRARIES MORE THAN ADULTS
BUT THE BIRTH RATE HAS FALLEN AND THERE ARE MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE
COMMUNITY TODAY THAN BEFORE; THIS, HOWEVER, IS NO EXCUSE FOR A DECLINE IN
LIBRARY STANDARDS. LIBRARIES MUST BECOME COMMUNICATION CENTRES, IN PARTICULAR
TO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE LIVING ALONE AND THE 4 MILLION FOREIGNERS IN WEST
GERMANY.
THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (II)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, BIELEFELD, OCT 80.
(FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 PREVIOUS ABSTRACT). LIBRARIES EXIST TO FULFIL HUMAN NEEDS
FOR EDUCATION, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND GENERAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT. FUTURE
LIBRARY PLANNING MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BALANCE OF STATIONARY AND
MOBILE ELEMENTS IN A SYSTEM, TO LOCAL NEEDS AND TO ADULT EDUCATION. BOTH
QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS CAN MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
LIBRARY SERVICES; STAFF OF HIGH CALIBRE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEDIA
THEMSELVES OR ADVANCED TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IN A LIBRARY
CAN ALIENATE THE READERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ABOUT MINIMUM
STANDARDS; EACH LIBRARY NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITY.
THE INNOVATION MOVEMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES 1981-85.

UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE EAST GERMAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE, DAS ZENTRALINSTITUT
FUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IS ORGANISING A
PROGRAMME ENCOURAGING LIBRARY STAFF TO DEVISE NEW TECHNICAL AIDS, WORK
PROCESSES AND ECONOMIC MEASURES. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUCH INNOVATIONS
CAN BE APPLIED ON A SCALE MUCH WIDER THAN THAT OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT,
DETERMINING FACTORS BEING THE CONDITIONS, STRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OF
EACH LIBRARY. THE INNOVATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A NEW INVENTION BUT SHOULD
RATHER BE A BETTER USE OF EXISTING MATERIAL OR IDEAS. THOSE TESTING THE
INNOVATIONS MUST HAVE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT. MORE PARTICIPATION
MUST BE ENCOURAGED FROM THE YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS.
A GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR LIBRARIES?.

PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS HALTED AT A POINT WHEN, BECAUSE OF THE
RECESSION, LIBRARY SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY. CURRENT ECONOMIC
MEASURES HAVE HIT LIBRARIES HARD. SOME PEOPLE NOW REGARD INFORMATION AS
MERCHANDISE FOR WHICH A SUITABLE MARKET PRICE MUST BE OBTAINED; THIS INCREASES
THE RISK OF INFORMATION SERVICES BEING TAKEN OVER BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH
COULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STATE BUDGETS. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO BYPASS THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OF
THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION ON THE INFORMATION MARKET LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKED
TO RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO THEIR TRADITIONAL TASKS. LIBRARIES MUST MOBILISE
RESERVES HITHERTO UNUSED; REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT NEW METHODS OF LITERATURE
PROVISION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. INITIAL ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS
CAN BE OVERCOME THROUGH RATIONALISATION, CENTRALISATION AND WIDER USE OF
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
THE LIBRARY UNION IN HAMBURG.

IN 1978 A COOPERATIVE SCHEME WAS INAUGURATED BETWEEN THE COMBINED STATE AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND OVER 100 INSTITUTE AND DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES OF THE
COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE A UNION CATALOGUE AND ORGANISE COOPERATIVE
PURCHASING OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. THE SCHEME HAS ALSO BEEN JOINED BY THE
TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AT HAMBURG-HARBURG AND WILL ULTIMATELY INCLUDE OTHER
LIBRARIES IN NORTH GERMANY. WORK ON THE UNION CATALOGUE HAS BEGUN WITH THE
UNIVERSITY'S PERIODICALS, FOR WHICH ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IS USED.
CHANGES IN THE DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL SHORTLY BE MADE AND MORE WORK IS
NEEDED ON HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. MORE SPACE AND MONEY WILL BE NEEDED AS THE
SCHEME EXPANDS.
A NATIONWIDE NETWORK: WHICH SCENARIO IS BEST?.

AN EDITED VERSION OF THE PAPER A NATIONWIDE NETWORK' DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNANCE,
SUPPORT. THE PAPER HAS BEEN PREPARED BY THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NETWORK
ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND IS A WORKING DOCUMENT INVITING COMMENT AND DISCUSSION
THROUGHOUT THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. IT OFFERS 3 SCENARIOS FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A NATIONWIDE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK' (1) A
LEGISLATIVE MODEL DEPENDENT ON CONGRESS TO MANDATE THE NETWORK AND PRESCRIBE
ITS GOVERNING STRUCTURE; (2) AN EVOLUTIONARY MODEL RESULTING FROM 2AD HOC1
AGREEMENTS; AND (3) A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL DEVELOPING FROM THE NON-PROFIT AND
FOR-PROFIT PRIVATE SYSTEMS IN RESPONSE TO DEMAND FROM THE MARKET PLACE.
REGIONAL COOPERATION' SOME PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS.

PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING OF THE WORKING PARTY ON PROVINCIAL CENTRAL
LIBRARIES IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE CUTBACKS IN LOCAL
GOVERNMENT FINANCES TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING DEMAND ON LIBRARIES FOR
TECHNICAL INFORMATION HAVE ENCOURAGED PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO COOPERATE WITH ONE
ANOTHER ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THEIR
SERVICES. IN ADDITION THE EXPECTATION THAT THE EXISTING NETWORK OF LIBRARIES
CHARGED WITH A REGIONAL SUPPORT FUNCTION WILL BE INCREASED, AND THE
DECENTRALISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AS PROPOSED IN THE NEW PUBLIC
SERVICES ACT, WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE THIS TREND. HOWEVER, WHERE LIBRARIES
ENTER INTO SCHEMES OF COOPERATION THE NEEDS OF THEIR READERS SHOULD REMAIN THE
PRIME CONSIDERATION.
WASHINGTON COUNTY COOPERATIVE LIBRARY SERVICES NETWORK.

OREGON'S WASHINGTON COUNTY COOPERATIVE LIBRARY SERVICES NETWORK BEGAN AS AN
INFORMAL BASIS IN 1974 WITH A UNION LIST OF SERIALS FOR INTERLIBRARY
BORROWING. THIS PROMPTED FUNDING FOR A STUDY OF COOPERATION AMONG LIBRARIES IN
THE COUNTY. A STUDY BY PHYLLIS I. DALTON SET GUIDELINES FOR GETTING A
COOPERATIVE EFFORT GOING AND A PILOT PROJECT WAS BEGUN. PROGRAMMES INITIATED
INCLUDED' BOOKS-BY-MAIL; COUNTYWIDE COURIER SERVICE; BACK-UP REFERENCE
SERVICE; STORE-FRONT COMMUNITY LIBRARIES; AND A ROTATING CASSETTE PROGRAMME.
TODAY WCCLS OPERATES ON A COUNTYWIDE SERIAL LEVY AND AWAITS AUTOMATION AND
CABLE TV AS THE ULTIMATE ANSWER TO A FULL COOPERATIVE EFFORT.
RELATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC.

EXAMINES THE USE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS BY LIBRARIES ILLUSTRATED WITH MANY US
EXAMPLES OF BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LIBRARIES.
YEAR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN WHITE RUSSIA.THE

 MAIN TRENDS OF THIS PROGRAMME ARE CONCERNED WITH' THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
LIBRARY SYSTEM-THE CENTRALISATION OF STATE LIBRARIES WAS COMPLETED IN THE 10TH
5-YEAR PLAN, THAT OF TRADE UNION LIBRARIES IS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETION.
THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL SEE THE CENTRALISATION OF SPECIALISED LIBRARIES, WITH
LIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES FORMING 1 SYSTEM; READER SERVICES, EDUCATION TOWARDS
COMMUNIST IDEALS BEING THE PRIORITY; ORGANISATION OF SERVICES TO THE
COMMUNITY-THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH EVERY LOCALITY, EVERY TOWN BOROUGH;
INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES, PRIORITY BEING GIVEN TO PARTY,
IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL WORKERS; LIBRARY STOCKS; AND RESEARCH AND
METHODOLOGICAL WORK.
NATIS' A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR MALAYSIA.

DISCUSSES THE UNESCO INITIATED CONCEPT OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM
(NATIS), AND DEVELOPS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIS IN
MALAYSIA. REVIEWS THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE FORMULATION OF A NATIONAL
INFORMATION POLICY, AND DESCRIBES THE PROPOSED ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE
MALAYSIAN NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THIS WOULD CONSIST OF' A NATIONAL
INFORMATION COUNCIL; A SECRETARIAT; AND SECTORAL COORDINATORS.
NEW HORIZONS IN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN THE RSFSR.

SUMMING UP THE WORK OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE LAST 5-YEAR PLAN, AND LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE NEXT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCERN 6 MAIN AREAS OF LIBRARY
ACTIVITY' THE COMPLETION OF CENTRALISATION; THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY
NETWORKS; THE RATIONAL EXPLOITATION OF STOCKS; THE BETTER TRAINING OF LIBRARY
STAFF; IMPROVING THE MATERIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL BASE OF LIBRARIES; AND
DEVELOPING WORK WITH READERS. IT IS NECESSARY TO SET SPECIFIC GOALS FOR THE
NEW 5-YEAR PLAN AND TO DRAW ON PAST EXPERIENCE TO HELP ACHIEVE THEM.
STATISTICS AS BASIS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARY
PROCESSES.

AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE WORKING OF A LIBRARY OR A LIBRARY SYSTEM CAN BE
CARRIED OUT BY MEANS OF STATISTICAL DATA OBTAINED FROM THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF
ITS ACTIVITIES. THESE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO' ACTIVITIES OF ITS ORGANISATIONAL
AND MATERIAL BASIS; WORK CONCERNING USERS; WORK RELATED TO LOANS. THE QUALITY
OF WORK CAN THEN BE DETERMINED BY MEANINGFUL CORRELATION OF INDIVIDUAL DATA
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 1 OF THESE GROUPS, OR BETWEEN THE DATA AND INDEXES OF
2 OR 3 GROUPS.
LAW CONCERNING THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARY
STATISTICS.

IN 1971 THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC DECREED BY
LAW THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFORMATION. ITS
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED HERE, MAINLY IN REGARD TO LIBRARY
STATISTICS PROVIDED WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT
STATE OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STATISTICS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1979; IT
SHOWED MANY SHORTCOMINGS CONCERNING STATISTICAL INDEXES AND THEIR DEFINITION.
AS A RESULT A UNIFIED STATISTICAL SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED WHICH IS HERE
DISCUSSED IN DETAIL.
NATIONAL RANKINGS AS A MEANS OF EVALUATING MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY PROGRAMS' A
COMPARATIVE STUDY.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE STUDY UNDERTAKEN TO ASSESS THE REASONS
FOR THE LOW RANKINGS RECEIVED BY THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
CENTER LIBRARY IN THE PUBLICATION 2ANNUAL STATISTICS FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL
LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA1. CONCLUDES THAT THE 2ANNUAL
STATISTICS1 AND OTHER TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF QUALITY ARE INAPPROPRIATE AND
INACCURATE MEASURES FOR EVALUATING LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, SINCE THEY ONLY MEASURE
RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND NOT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE ALLOCATIONS. SUGGESTS
SOME ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION METHODS.
DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.

FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGERIAL
SCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF LIBRARIES, THIS PAPER
INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. DSS, A BLENDING OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, CAN LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS BY LIBRARY MANAGERS. A CASE
STUDY OF THE UTILISATION OF A DSS IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS OF A MEDIUM SIZED
LIBRARY ILLUSTRATES THE PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES AND THE CONTROL THEY EXERCISE OVER PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC HAS ASSIGNED TO
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES THE TASK OF PARTICIPATING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES IN ALL ITS ASPECTS. THIS IS DONE BY INSPECTION, ADVICE AND FINALLY
SUGGESTION OF SOLUTIONS TO THE LIBRARY'S MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. THE SCOPE OF
THEIR AUTHORITY IS, HOWEVER, NOT QUITE CLEAR. DELEGATION OF GREATER
INDEPENDENCE OF DECISION TO METHODOLOGICAL WORKERS IS DESIRABLE. SOLUTIONS
SUGGESTED FOR METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO DISTRICT AND SIMILAR LIBRARIES ARE
EXPRESSED BY MEANS OF FLOW-CHARTS.
INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE WORK AT A NEW LEVEL IN CENTRALISED
SYSTEMS.

CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS HAVE RESPONDED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO THE CALL
FOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WORK. EXAMPLES FROM ALL OVER THE USSR
SHOW HOW THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN MORE BOOK PROMOTION AND INFORMATION
DISSEMINATION; ORGANISED SURVEYS TO ASCERTAIN THE INFORMATION NEEDS IN THEIR
AREA; PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS; AND
ESTABLISHED IMPORTANT LINKS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
CENTRES AT REPUBLICAN LEVEL. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, MINDFUL OF THEIR ROLE TO SERVE
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, ARE ALSO TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF
POLITICAL WORKERS, TEACHERS AND OTHERS OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF MATERIAL
PRODUCTION.
SOME ISSUES IN PLANNING THE WORK OF CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

PLANNING IN THE WORK OF CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS CAN BE SEEN AS THE METHOD
BY WHICH THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CREATED FOR THE SATISFACTION OF
THE DEMANDS OF THE LOCAL POPULATION FOR BOOKS AND FOR INFORMATION. PLANNING
PROCEDURES HAVE HAD TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS LIBRARIES HAVE COMBINED INTO
CENTRALISED SYSTEMS AND RECENT EXPERIENCES FROM LIBRARIES FROM ALL OVER THE
USSR CAN BE COMPARED. THE INTRODUCTION OF LONG-TERM PLANNING IN THIS RESPECT
IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT.
YOU TOO CAN BE A LIBRARY PLANNER-PART I.

PART 1 OF A 2-PART INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MANUAL A
PLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE KEY FEATURES OF THE ALA PROCESS
WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR UK AND US PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ARE THAT IT IS FLEXIBLE,
PARTICIPATIVE AND GOAL-ORIENTED. THE MANUAL'S 'PRIMARY CYCLE' IS DIVIDED INTO
3 SUBCYCLES: THE TRAINING CYCLE; THE THINKING CYCLE; AND THE MEASURING CYCLE.
DESCRIBES THE STEPS WHICH ARE NORMALLY THE SAME IN EACH SUBCYCLE. EMPHASISES
THE NEED FOR CONSULTATION WITH OTHER STAFF.
YOU TOO CAN BE A LIBRARY PLANNER-PART II.

PART II OF A 2-PART INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MANUAL 2A
PLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES1 FOR MEMBERS OF PLANNING TEAMS USING THE
ALA PROCESS (FOR PART I, 2SEE1 PRECEDING ABSTRACT). DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY AS A
PURPOSEFUL SYSTEM AND THE ROLE OF THE ABACON CHART. THE CHART CONSISTS OF A
RECTANGULAR PLOT OF PREDICTED PERFORMANCE OF AN ALTERNATIVE FOR A PARTICULAR
GOAL AGAINST IMPORTANCE OF THE GOAL, WITH A BOX AT THE FOOT OF THE CHART TO
RECORD THE VISUAL ESTIMATES OF THE RELATIVE ACCEPTABILITY OF EACH ALTERNATIVE.
GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF ITS USE.
A COST DATABASE FOR BRANCH LIBRARY RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND PERFORMANCE
EVALUATION.

SHOWS HOW THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION LIBRARIES (USA) HAVE IMPROVED THEIR
KNOWLEDGE OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION BY TAGGING EACH EXPENDITURE ACCORDING TO
FISCAL YEAR, LIBRARY GOAL, OBJECT CLASS, FUND TYPE, FUND SOURCE, COST CENTRE,
AND BENEFIT CENTRE. DESCRIBES HOW THE DATA IS GATHERED AND MANIPULATED.
MEASURING LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IS ULTIMATELY DESIRED, THEN COMPARISONS
BETWEEN BRANCHES CAN BE MEANINGFUL.
COPING WITH LIMITED BUDGETS BY SHARING RESOURCES.

TO COPE WITH LIMITED BUDGETS, US HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES ARE RESTRICTING
THEIR PURCHASES AND RELYING ON RESOURCE SHARING. DISCUSSES SOME SPECIFICS ON
HOW THIS IS DONE AND THE DANGERS IT ENTAILS.
PENNYWISE' A SUMMARY OF BUDGET PROCEDURES.

CONSIDERS 7 BUDGETARY APPROACHES FOR LIBRARIANS' LUMP-SUM; LINE-ITEM; FORMULA;
PROGRAMME; PERFORMANCE; PLANNING PROGRAMMING BUDGETING SYSTEMS AND ZERO-BASED
BUDGETING. NOT ALL ARE USED WITH EQUAL FREQUENCY IN SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC
LIBRARIES, BUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH IS A STEP
TOWARD THE FISCAL SELF-EDUCATION THAT WILL HELP LIBRARIES HOLD THEIR OWN WITH
BUDGETARY DECISION-MAKERS.
CHINESE CHARACTER COMPUTER ENCODING METHODS AND LIBRARY AUTOMATION' A
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SURVEY.

DESCRIBES DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINESE CHARACTER COMPUTER ENCODING METHODS AND
LIBRARY AUTOMATION. MUCH EFFORT IS EXPENDED IN INDIVIDUAL AND EXPANDED
PROJECTS WHILE INCREASED INTERCOMMUNICATION AND CONCERTED ENDEAVOURS MIGHT
HELP TO SOLVE COMMON PROBLEMS.
EVALUATING WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS' ABILITY TO STORE DATA.

DESCRIBES THE EVALUATION OF STORAGE OF DATA IN WORD PROCESSORS FOR LIBRARY
PURPOSES IN TERMS OF' DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDIUM AND THEIR STORAGE
CAPABILITIES; TOTAL ON-LINE STORAGE; THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF STORAGE DEVICES
USABLE AT 1 TIME; THE NUMBER OF FILES AVAILABLE ON-LINE; FILE LENGTH; HOW TO
ARCHIVE; COPYING FILES AND DISCS; SAFETY AND SECURITY; AND SPECIAL FEATURES OF
SYSTEMS.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS.

AIMS TO PROVIDE A STARTING POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT A SMALL COMPUTER
SYSTEM FOR LIBRARY APPLICATIONS INCLUDES AND HOW TO GET FURTHER INFORMATION ON
COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. CONSIDERS' TERMINOLOGY; ADDING
TERMINALS; PRINTING CAPABILITIES; DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISC STORAGE;
COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES; AND SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE. REGARDLESS OF WHO
SUPPLIES THE COMPUTER (OR COMPUTER SERVICES), SOMEONE ON THE STAFF MUST TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROJECT.
TEXT EDITIONG FOR LIBRARIANS' TRADING THE TYPEWRITER FOR THE TERMINAL.

A BRIEF GUIDE TO THE USE OF TEXT EDITORS IN A LIBRARY SITUATION. A TEXT EDITOR
IS 1 OR MORE COMPUTER PROGRAMS ALLOWING THE USER TO ENTER, MANIPULATE, STORE
AND RETRIEVE TEXT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A LARGE COMPUTER. A POTENTIAL USER
SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EDITOR, ESPECIALLY THE
EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS CAN BE EDITED, THE RANGE OF FEATURES
AVAILABLE FOR EDITING PROPER, AND THE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE FOR
PRINTING, BEFORE MAKING A COMMITMENT TO COMPUTER-BASED TEXT EDITING. OUTLINES
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE PROCESS.
COMPUTERISATION IN BRITISH LIBRARIES' A PERSONAL IMPRESSION.

REPORT ON A STUDY OF COMPUTERISATION IN UK LIBRARIES CARRIED OUT ON AN
IMPERIAL RELATIONS TRUST BURSARY. DESCRIBES ORDERING AND CATALOGUING,
COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES,
PRESTEL, COMPUTER AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, BASED CHIEFLY ON OBSERVATIONS AT
LIBRARIES WITHIN THE BIRMINGHAM LIBRARIES COOPERATIVE MECHANIZATION PROJECT

MISSOURI STATEWIDE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE SURVEY.

CONTAINS THE CONDUCT, METHODOLOGY, AND MAJOR FINDINGS OF A SURVEY OF ALL THE
LIBRARIES IN MISSOURI TO ASSESS THEIR NEEDS FOR A STATEWIDE DATA BASE. THE
SURVEY ADDRESSES THE CURRENT STATE OF AUTOMATION, THE FUNCTIONS THAT LIBRARIES
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A DATA BASE PERFORM, THE MATERIALS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE
DATA BASE, AND THE MEANS OF FINANCING AND GOVERNING IT. IT ALSO INCLUDES
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MISSOURI BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE COMMITTEE DEVELOPED
FROM THE SURVEY. APPENDICES PROVIDE A SURVEY BACKGROUND LETTER, THE
QUESTIONNAIRE, AND DETAILED TABLES OF SURVEY RESULTS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE
FROM NTIS.
SEMINAR AT LAUSANNE CANTONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, 7-9 JULY 1980.

REPORT OF A WORKSHOP ON INTEGRATED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT AND THE LAUSANNE
INTEGRATED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM (SIBIL). THE LIBRARY'S REGIONAL AND
UNIVERSITY FUNCTIONS ARE OUTLINED, AND THE PROCESS OF AUTOMATION PRESENTED IN
THE CONTEXT OF RECENT LIBRARY REORGANISATION AND TRANSFERRAL FROM THE URBAN
AREA. SYSTEMS CHARACTERISTICS AND OPERATIONS ARE DESCRIBED COMPREHENSIVELY,
WITH DETAILS OF CURRENT PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENTS SCHEDULED AT LOCAL, NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. AUTOMATION COSTS ARE ANALYSED AND THE RELATIVE
ADVANTAGES AND INCONVENIENCES OF THE SYSTEM TO DATE SURVEYED.
WHY' COMES BEFORE 'HOW': PLANNING FOR AUTOMATION IN THE REAL WORLD.I

MPORTANT REASONS FOR PLANNING FOR AUTOMATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES
ARE' EXPECTATIONS OF PARENT ORGANISATION ADMINISTRATORS; COST AND VISIBILITY
OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION; LOWERED ACCEPTANCE OF TRIAL AND ERROR; AND THE HEDGE
AGAINST CATASTROPHE. PROVIDES A STEP-BY-STEP PLAN FOR SUCCESS DRAWING ON
EXPERIENCES AT CINCINNATI UNIVERSITY, OHIO.
AUTOMATION AT THE EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE LIBRARY' TOWARDS AN ITALIAN
NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE.

COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE INTEGRATED AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEM AT THE
EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE LIBRARY NOW IN OPERATION, AS A PROTOTYPE UNIT
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROJECTED ITALIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE. THE
PRINCIPLES GOVERNING LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND COOPERATION ARE REVIEWED BRIEFLY,
AND RELATED TO ITALIAN POLICY AND PLANNING. THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE
EXTENSION OF THE IUE SYSTEM TO OTHER ITALIAN LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED, IN
PARTICULAR THE EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE PERMITTING ONE NATIONAL SERVICE TO
FUNCTION ON SEVERAL COMPUTERS.
MICROCOMPUTERS AS A MODERN BASE FOR AUTOMATING LIBRARY, INFORMATION AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCESSES.

THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY HAS BEEN FACED WITH THE NEED TO CREATE AUTOMATED
SYSTEMS FOR COORDINATING STOCK SELECTION, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION WORK AND
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING. THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE A CAPACITY
FOR SELECTING, STORING, RETRIEVING AND PRESENTING INFORMATION, HIGH
RELIABILITY AND LOW COST. THE EXPENSE OF LARGE COMPUTERS HAS RETARDED THEIR
USE IN LOCALISED SITUATIONS, BUT THE MICROCOMPUTER CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
BEFORE CHOOSING A COMPUTER, IT IS WORTHWHILE CONSIDERING THE FEATURES OF EACH
TYPE AND THE OPINIONS OF WORLD EXPERTS. THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY HAS FOUND THAT
A MICROCOMPUTER CAN MEET ITS REQUIREMENTS PERFECTLY SATISFACTORILY.
JOBS AND STAFFING REQUIREMENTS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN THE GERMAN FEDERAL
REPUBLIC AND HAMBURG.

DESCRIBES RESULTS OF A SURVEY PUBLISHED IN MAY 81 ON THE STAFFING SITUATION
AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN WEST GERMAN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, INCLUDING' GENERAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THE 670 PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES; POSTS AVAILABLE IN THE
VARIOUS SERVICE GRADES; DIVISION OF POSTS BETWEEN THE MAIN WORK SPHERES;
VACANT POSTS; TEMPORARY POSTS; NEW POSTS CREATED IN 1979 AND 1980; PLANNED
CHANGES IN STAFFING. THE SURVEY WAS INTENDED TO SHOW THE VARYING SITUATIONS IN
DIFFERENT JOB GRADES AND IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND TO GIVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF
PROMOTION PROSPECTS. HOPES OF IMPROVING SALARIES IN CERTAIN STATES, ESPECIALLY
HESSE AND HAMBURG, HAVE BEEN DASHED BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION
BUT THE SURVEY HAS PROVIDED USEFUL INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD STIMULATE FURTHER
DISCUSSION.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

PREPARED FROM THE AUTHOR'S NOTES FOR A TALK AT THE ONTARIO LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
CONFERENCE, OCT 80. IDENTIFIES SOME ASPECTS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT WHICH ARE
SPECIAL TO CHILDREN'S PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO
SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN THE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT ROLE, BEING FAMILIAR WITH TOP
MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS DESPITE THE TRADITIONAL PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL
ISOLATION OF THE CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT. SMOOTH RUNNING OF THE DEPARTMENT IS
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS THE CLIENTS' EMOTIONAL DEMANDS ON STAFF ARE SO
GREAT. THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN MUST ESTABLISH HIS PLACE IN THE LIBRARY'S
MIDDLE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND TACTFULLY ENSURE THAT HIS DEPARTMENT, TOO, HAS A
FULL COMPLEMENT OF PROFESSIONALLY-QUALIFIED STAFF.
ALLOCATION OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE FUNDING IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE UNITS OF THE
UCLA LIBRARY.

GIVES DETAILS OF DATA COLLECTION AND CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF
FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES NEEDED TO RUN PUBLIC SERVICE UNITS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES. THE RESULTS ARE USED TO ASSESS THE
ALLOCATION OF FUNDING FOR STUDENT ASSISTANCE TO SUPPLEMENT THE REGULAR STAFF.
DISCUSSES ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT HAVE BECOME APPARENT.
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS IN THE 1970S' AN ANALYSIS OF
THE PAST DECADE.

THE STUDY ANALYSED ACADEMIC LIBRARY POSITION VACANCIES ADVERTISED IN 2LIBR.
J1. FROM 1970-79 IN THE CATEGORIES OF POSITION TYPE, POSITION LEVEL, AND
GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. THE PAST DECADE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY FLUCTUATING LEVELS
OF ADVERTISED JOB OPPORTUNITIES. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE CURRENTLY ENTERING A
PERIOD OF MARKED DECLINE, INDICATING DIMINISHED FUTURE EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS
FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS.
DIVERSITY OF EMPLOYMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP GRADUATES.

WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEGREE COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP, UK STUDENTS ARE
STUDYING A WIDER VARIETY OF SUBJECTS AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENTER A WIDER
VARIETY OF PROFESSIONS. IN FUTURE THEY MAY OBTAIN POSTS IN THE NEWLY
DEVELOPING INFORMATION INDUSTRY.
JOB SHARING FOR THE 80'S.

JOB SHARING, WHEN 2 WORKERS SHARE 1 POSITION, IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR
AS A MEANS OF BALANCING JOB SATISFACTION AND TIME DEVOTED TO FAMILY AND
LEISURE PURSUITS. THE ADVANTAGES AND PROBLEMS OF JOB SHARING ARE OUTLINED AND
A JOB SHARING EXPERIMENT AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF COLUMBUS AND FRANKLIN
COUNTY, OHIO IS DESCRIBED.
POST-MLS EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS.

IN A SURVEY OF JOB LISTINGS IN 2 LIBRARY PERIODICALS, THE EDUCATIONAL
REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANS WERE EVALUATED FOR 1970-79.
IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-DIRECTOR STAFF AND UNIVERSITY
DIRECTORS ROSE UNTIL 1976 AND HAVE SINCE DECLINED. IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT
THERE EXIST EDUCATIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIRECTOR AND NON-DIRECTOR
POSITIONS AND BETWEEN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POSITIONS. PRESENTS THE SURVEY
RESULTS, AND DESCRIBES TESTS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE STATISTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DATA.
JOB STRESS AND BURNOUT' OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS FOR SERVICES STAFF.

OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS OF STRESS ARE NOTED IN INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATED WITH
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SERVICE DELIVERY IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. STAFF PERFORMING
DUTIES REQUIRING DIRECT SERVICE TO THE LIBRARY USER ARE EXPRESSING CONCERN
ABOUT NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF JOB STRESS AND THE NONPRODUCTIVE RESULTS OF
BURNOUT. 3 COMPONENTS CONTRIBUTING TO NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTICS ARE HIGHLIGHTED
AS SOURCES OF FRUSTRATION FOR SERVICE STAFF. THESE ARE' ABILITY TO HANDLE A
STRESSFUL OCCUPATION, TRADITIONAL ORGANISATION STRUCTURE, AND FRAGMENTED
PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT. DISCUSSES SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVE INDIVIDUAL
COPING STRATEGIES, ENHANCED ORGANISATIONAL DESIGN, AND COHESIVE PROFESSIONAL
SUPPORT.
FACULTY STATUS FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION' A REVIEW AND
ANALYSIS.

RESPONSES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE FROM 64 4-YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE
ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION REVEAL THAT 62 OF THE SCHOOLS GRANT SOME OF THEIR
LIBRARIANS FACULTY STATUS, AND THAT 40 GRANT FACULTY STATUS TO ALL LIBRARIANS.
THE GREATEST DISCREPANCY IN BENEFITS RECEIVED BY TEACHING AND LIBRARY FACULTY
ARISES IN LENGTH OF CONTRACT YEAR AND PUBLISHING RESPONSIBILITIES. DIRECTORS
OF ONLY 12 OF THE 40 LIBRARIES NOTE CONTROVERSY OVER FACULTY STATUS FOR
LIBRARIANS, YET COMMENTS ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE RESULTS THEMSELVES
SUGGEST OTHERWISE. ALSO, RESPONDENTS' UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES
AND BENEFITS INDICATES A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT FACULTY STATUS SHOULD MEAN
TO AND FOR THEM.
RANK, STATUS, AND CONTRIBUTION OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AS PERCEIVED BY THE
TEACHING FACULTY AT SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY, CARBONDALE.

A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE TEACHING FACULTIES'
PERCEPTIONS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AT SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,
CARBONDALE. EACH QUESTION WAS ANALYSED BY ACADEMIC UNIT AND RANK OF THE
RESPONDENTS. SERVICE WAS PERCEIVED AS THE LIBRARIANS' MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION,
BUT MANY TEACHING FACULTY MEMBERS INDICATED THAT LIBRARIANS SHOULD CONDUCT
RESEARCH IF THEY ARE TO BE AWARDED FACULTY RANK AND STATUS. HIGHER-RANKING
RESPONDENTS USED LIBRARY MATERIALS AND LIBRARIANS' SERVICES MOST OFTEN. 57% OF
RESPONDENTS FAVOURED ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AT SIU-C HAVING FACULTY RANK AND
STATUS.
PRO LIBRA MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPEN: A CORPS OF 'TEMP' LIBRARY WORKERS
TACKLES ALL KINDS OF JOBS.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES PRO LIBRA ASSOCIATES INC., A CADRE OF 200 CAREFULLY SCREENED
PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS AND CLERICAL WORKERS WHO PERFORM A VARIETY OF LIBRARY
TASKS ON A CONTRACT BASIS IN NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT, PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK
AND WASHINGTON D.C. SERVICES INCLUDE SPACE PLANNING, ORGANISING AND
MAINTAINING COLLECTIONS, TAKING INVENTORY, CONVERTING CATALOGUES, PREPARING
FOR NEW AUTOMATED SYSTEMS, CLASSIFYING, INDEXING AND ON-LINE SEARCHING.
IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARIES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY
OF WORKING LIFE.

EXAMINES TECHNIQUES FOR THE REDESIGN OF WORK IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. TRACES THE
HISTORY OF WORK SYSTEM DESIGN AND PRESENTS METHODS THAT ADHERE TO QUALITY OF
WORKING LIFE (QWL) PRINCIPLES. REVIEWS THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AND THE
APPLICATION OF THESE METHODS. BY IMPLEMENTING THESE OR SIMILAR ADVANCED
METHODS OF ORGANISATION AND WORK SYSTEM DESIGN, ACADEMIC LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
ABLE TO RESPOND MORE EFFECTIVELY TO RAPID CHANGES IN USER DEMAND AND IMPROVE
THE QWL OF EMPLOYEES.

COMMITTEE SET UP TO EXPLORE THE MANPOWER RESERVES AT THE HUNGARIAN CENTRAL
TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE. EXPLAINS THE NECESSITY OF THE
STUDY AND IDENTIFIES THE SOURCES OF MANPOWER RESERVES AS WELL AS THE
ADVANTAGES OF A PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED ORGANISATION.
POSSIBLE MEANS OF EXPLORING THE MANPOWER RESERVES AT THE HUNGARIAN CENTRAL
TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE. PART 2.

PART 2 OF A 3-PART STUDY WHICH SUMMARISES THE FINDINGS OF AN IN-HOUSE AD HOC
COMMITTEE SET UP TO EXPLORE THE MANPOWER RESERVES AT THE HUNGARIAN CENTRAL
TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE. THE CONCEPT OF ROUTINE WORK, THE
REASONS FOR THE LACK OF OUTPUT STANDARDS AND THE USE OF PRODUCTION NORMS ARE
DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. (FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 THE PREVIOUS ABSTRACT).
LIBRARY STAFF DEVELOPMENT COURSE.

BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED 14 JUNE 78 AT THE 78TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE
MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. DESCRIBES THE STAFF
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME OPERATED BY THE MOODY MEDICAL LIBRARY AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF TEXAS. THE PROGRAMME'S PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR THE
LIBRARY STAFF WHILE CONCURRENTLY' (1) PROVIDING INFORMATION CONCERNING
SPECIFIC LIBRARY SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES; (2) ILLUSTRATING THE
INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LIBRARY; (3)
DEVELOPING A SENSE OF TEAMWORK AND LOYALTY; AND (4) DEVELOPING JOB PRIDE.
INCLUDES THE FORM USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAMME'S VARIOUS
COMPONENTS.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN SCARCITY-STAFFING.

WITH STUDENT NUMBERS FALLING, CUTS IN BUDGETS AND MERGING OF POLYTECHNICS IN
THE UK, PROVIDING ADEQUATE STAFFING IN HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES IS A BIG
PROBLEM. DISCUSSES THE WILLINGNESS OF STAFF TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THEIR WORK, THE
ROLE OF UNIONS, FREEZING OF POSTS, MORALE AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.
ABOUT THE BUILDING MODEL FOR COUNTY LIBRARIES.

DESCRIBES THE BUILDING MODEL FOR HUNGARIAN COUNTY LIBRARIES, STARTING FROM THE
FACT THAT SUCH LIBRARIES DO NOT MEET ONLY THE DEMANDS OF THE COUNTY BUT ALSO
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE COUNTY SEAT (LARGE CITY). DEALS
WITH THE AREA SYSTEM OF LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR INTERCONNECTIONS, PAYING SPECIAL
ATTENTION TO THE USERS' DEMANDS. SUGGESTS THAT THE DESIRED ORDER OF MAGNITUDE
FOR COUNTY LIBRARIES EXCEEDS THE PROPOSALS OF THE RESPECTING PLANNING
PRESCRIPTIONS AND-DEPENDING ON LOCAL CONDITIONS-IT LIES BETWEEN 4500 SQ. M.
AND 8-10,000 SQ. M.
THE ARCHITECTS' COMPETITION FOR THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY LIBRARY.

GUTERSLOH PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS FOUNDED IN 1979 AS A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY BY
THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL AND THE FIRM OF BERTELSMANN. IN 1980, SINCE EXISTING
ACCOMMODATION WAS TOO SMALL, AN ARCHITECTS' COMPETITION WAS HELD TO DESIGN A
NEW LIBRARY BASED ON THE '3-TIER SYSTEM'. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE TOP 5
DESIGNS. THE WINNER HAS PLACED ON THE GROUND FLOOR A PASSAGE RUNNING RIGHT
THROUGH THE LIBRARY TO THE PARK BEYOND; OFF THIS PASSAGE IS THE '1ST TIER' OF
POPULAR FICTION AND NON-FICTION, ISSUE COUNTER AND READERS' CAFE WITH
NEWSPAPERS. THE 1ST AND 2ND FLOORS HOUSE MORE FICTION, NON-FICTION AND
PERIODICALS; THE 2ND FLOOR ALSO HOUSES STUDY CARRELS, MEDIA CENTRE, CONFERENCE
ROOM, STACK, ART CENTRE AND OFFICES. THE ADMINISTRATION SECTION IS ON THE 3RD
FLOOR AND THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ON THE LOWER GROUND FLOOR.
COVER PICTURE (BONN CENTRAL LIBRARY).

BONN CENTRAL LIBRARY, A NEW MUNICIPAL LIBRARY, WAS OPENED IN OCT 80 IN THE
FORMER CITY HALL. THE 4-STORIED BUILDING HOUSES A LENDING LIBRARY, JUNIOR
LIBRARY, ENGLISH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION DESK ON THE GROUND FLOOR, WITH
READING ROOM (120 PLACES) AND 300 CURRENT PERIODICALS ABOVE. ADMINISTRATION
AND CENTRAL CATALOGUES ARE ON THE UPPER FLOORS TOGETHER WITH AN AUDIO-VISUAL
CENTRE WHICH CONCENTRATES ON THE SPOKEN WORD. FILMS, SLIDES ETC. ARE AVAILABLE
TO SCHOOLS AND ORGANISATIONS. THE MAIN MUSIC LIBRARY IS IN A SEPARATE
BUILDING, THE HISTORICAL SCHUMANN HOUSE. FITTINGS AND FACILITIES OF THE NEW
LIBRARY ARE DESCRIBED.
LIBRARIES AND BUILDINGS. INTERRELATIONSHIPS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE HEIDELBERG
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

THE GROWTH OF LIBRARIES IN THIS CENTURY HAS LED TO REGULAR REBUILDING AND
REHOUSING OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE AT THE
HEIDELBERG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE LIBRARY WAS BUILT IN 1905 AND IS STILL
HOUSED IN THE ORIGINAL BUILDING WHICH IS NOW PROTECTED AS A LISTED BUILDING.
IN THE 1950S SOME INTERIOR STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE
GENERAL EFFICIENCY OF THE LIBRARY. FROM 1959 TO 1978 VARIOUS PLANS WERE MADE
FOR NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS. THESE INCLUDED AN EXTENSION TO THE
LIBRARY IN PART OF THE OLD TOWN OF HEIDELBERG, A NEW BUILDING ON A NEW SITE TO
SERVE THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACULTIES AND SMALL EXTENSIONS FOR EXTRA
STORAGE. FINALLY DUE TO PLANNING RESTRICTIONS IN THE OLD TOWN AND THE 1966/67
RECESSION THE LIBRARY REMAINED AS IT WAS WITH TEMPORARY USE OF A MEDICAL
INSTITUTE BUILDING WHICH INVOLVES TRANSPORT PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE 2 SITES.
A HIGHLIGHT IN THE MIDDLE FRANCONIAN LIBRARY SCENE.

IN 1981 A NEW COMBINED GYMNASIUM (GRAMMAR SCHOOL) AND PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS
OPENED AT GUNZENHAUSEN, IN THE WEISSENBURG LIBRARY SYSTEM. SINCE THE OLD
PREMISES WERE TOO SMALL, A NEW LIBRARY WAS MADE FROM A FORMER HOSPITAL
BUILDING NEXT DOOR TO THE SCHOOL LIBRARY. NEAR THE ENTRANCE IS THE INFORMATION
CENTRE, WITH THE ISSUE SYSTEM AND 25 STUDY PLACES NEAR THE REFERENCE WORKS.
THE NON-FICTION, ARRANGED IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS AND THE AUDIO CENTRE, WHERE
CASSETTES AND MUSIC BOOKS ARE SHELVED TOGETHER, ARE NEARBY. A 2ND ROOM
CONTAINS ADULT FICTION AND LITERATURE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS. THERE
IS A SPECIAL SEATING AREA FOR CHILDREN, WITH HEADPHONE SETS AND TROUGHS FOR
PICTURE BOOKS. STOCKS TOTAL 18,000 VOLUMES.
A SCHOOL BECOMES A LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE CONVERSION OF A REDUNDANT SCHOOL BUILDING INTO A NEW PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN HERSHEY, PENNSYLVANIA WITH A GRANT FROM THE HERSHEY FOODS
CORPORATION. INCLUDES BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOGRAPHS AND A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON
THE ROLE OF THE DESIGNER AND RENOVATING OLD BUILDINGS.
THE CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC HERITAGE IN LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT A MEETING OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF EAST GERMANY, JAN 81.
IN ORDER TO RECTIFY UNSUITABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE PROVISION OF THE GERMAN
LITERARY HERITAGE IN LIBRARIES OF VARIOUS SIZES, A LIST HAS BEEN PUBLISHED OF
RECOMMENDED STOCKS, ACCORDING TO LIBRARY SIZE, FROM THE MAIN WORKS OF 43
GERMAN WRITERS AND POETS FROM 1750 TO 1848. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD CHECK
THEIR STOCKS AND TRANSFER MATERIAL TO PLACES WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED. TO
AROUSE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS PERIOD, LECTURES, READINGS AND EXHIBITIONS WILL
BE ORGANISED AND CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND COLLECTED WORKS PUBLISHED. IT MAY
BE POSSIBLE TO ATTRACT READERS THROUGH A GROWING INTEREST IN MODERN WRITERS.
LISTS OF NEW ACQUISITIONS' A CONTRIBUTION TO LIBRARY PUBLICITY.

IN JUNE 78 131 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WERE ASKED WHETHER THEY ISSUED LISTS OF NEW
ACQUISITIONS; THE 116 REPLIES RECEIVED SHOWED THAT 49 DID ISSUE SUCH LISTS AND
67 DID NOT. SUITABLE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO EACH GROUP; DETAILED ANALYSIS
IS GIVEN OF THEIR ANSWERS ON AIMS BEHIND LIST ISSUE, LIST STRUCTURE, TARGET
GROUPS, PRODUCTION FORMS, COSTS, ADVERTISING, POSSIBILITIES OF USE CONTROL,
ALTERATION PROCESSES, CRITICISM AGAINST LISTS AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO
THEM. PRODUCTION OF THESE LISTS IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING; EACH LIBRARY
MUST DECIDE FOR ITSELF WHETHER IT IS WORTH PRODUCING THEM. IF BETTER USE IS TO
BE MADE OF THE LISTS, MORE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE SELECTION OF MATERIAL
AND TARGET GROUPS. IN FUTURE, SPECIFIC SUBJECT LISTS INCLUDING NON-COMMERCIAL
WORKS WILL PREDOMINATE OVER LISTS OF GENERAL MATERIAL AND ELECTRONIC DATA
PROCESSING WILL BE USED INCREASINGLY IN THEIR PRODUCTION.
A CHILDREN'S LITERATURE COURSE FOR PARENTS.

DESCRIBES THE CONTENT OF A SERIES OF 4 LECTURES ON CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HELD
FOR INTERESTED PARENTS AT THE BETHLEHEM PUBLIC LIBRARY, NEW YORK. THE COURSE
WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR PARENTS TO HELP MAKE READING
ENJOYABLE AND HABIT FORMING FOR THEIR CHILDREN, AND THE TOPICS COVERED
INCLUDED' THE HISTORY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE; PICTURE BOOKS; FANTASY AND
FAIRY TALES; MODERN FICTION; AND THE USE OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION
AND SUBJECT INDEXES.
INTERNATIONAL TNO CONFERENCE (14TH), INFORMATION SOCIETY' CHANGES, CHANCES,
CHALLENGES HELD AT THE HILTON HOTEL, ROTTERDAM, MARCH 18-19, 1981.

THE REPORT CONTAINS THE PAPERS PRESENTED AT AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE
IMPLICATIONS, PROBLEMS, AND POSSIBILITIES OF SOCIETY IN THE INFORMATION AGE.
THE EFFECTIVITY OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUE.

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION AND USE OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUES MUST BE
OBSERVED IN ORDER THAT THE POSSIBLE RATIONALISATION EFFECTS MAY BE BEST USED.
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT PROBLEMS CAN ARISE THROUGH THE POSSIBILITIES OF
MANIFOLD APPLICATION OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY BEST
SOLVED FROM THE ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW JUST BY THE USE OF SPECIAL EQUIPMENT.
MANUFACTURERS AND USERS OF MICROFILM EQUIPMENT MUST COOPERATE TO ACHIEVE AN
AGREEMENT ON THE PRODUCTION OF A RANGE OF EQUIPMENT SUITED TO ITS PURPOSES AND
ON LONG-TERM BASIC PRODUCTION MEASURES. METHODS OF ESTIMATING THE EFFECTIVITY
OF MICROFILM TECHNIQUES ARE PRESENTED, WITH REGARD TO CURRENT SERVICE
EFFICIENCY, TYPES OF INFORMATION WORK CARRIED OUT, THE KIND, SIZE AND NUMBER
OF DOCUMENTS INVOLVED, THE RANGE OF USERS AND THE CALCULATION OF UNIT COSTS
AND POSSIBLE SAVINGS.
PRESS DOCUMENTATION AND MICROGRAPHY.

DISCUSSES HOW MICROGRAPHY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE ORGANISATION, MANAGEMENT AND
OPERATION OF DOCUMENTATION CENTRES USING PRESS MATERIAL. A WIDE VARIETY OF
POTENTIAL USERS EXISTS FOR ARCHIVES BASED ON NEWSPAPERS, AND WHILE SUCH
CENTRES HAVE PROBLEMS IN COMMON CAUSED BY THE NATURE OF SUCH MATERIALS, EACH
HAS REQUIREMENTS OF ITS OWN DICTATED BY ITS OWN SPECIAL FUNCTIONS. GENERAL
TOPICS ONLY ARE CONSIDERED HERE' THE POSSIBILITIES OF MICROGRAPHY IN
CONSERVATION AND STORAGE, AND HOW MICROFORMS CAN BE USED IN DISSEMINATING
INFORMATION EITHER IN THE FORM OF PRESS DOSSIERS OR DATA BANKS. IN CONCLUSION,
DISCUSSES COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS AS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO EXPANDING THE USE OF
MICROGRAPHY IN THIS FIELD.
THE USE OF PHOTOCOMPOSITION AND FILMSETTING FOR THE COMPUTERISED PRODUCTION OF
INFORMATION MEDIA.

THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF PROCESSING TEXTUAL AND OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION, FOR
PHOTOCOMPOSITION AND FILMSETTING THROUGH THE USE OF ESER COMPUTERS; VARIOUS
METHODS FOR USING THESE TECHNIQUES, BASED ON THE COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE
RANGE OF THE EQUIPMENT, ARE DESCRIBED. FIRSTLY, A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF
TYPESETTING IS DESCRIBED TO ILLUSTRATE THE TECHNICAL PROCESSES AND THE
TYPOGRAPHICALLY NEW QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN PHOTOCOPYING AND
FILMSETTING EQUIPMENT. THE ESER SETTING PROGRAMME, DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY THE
DATA PROCESSING CENTRE IN BERLIN AND OTHER INTERESTED BODIES INVOLVED IN
PRINTING AND GRAPHICS, REPRESENTS AN EXCELLENT TEXT PROCESSING PROGRAMME
SYSTEM WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO OUTSIDE USERS. THE MODULAR CONCEPT ALLOWS
THE RATIONAL USE OF PHOTOCOMPOSITION AND FILMSETTING FOR PRODUCTION OF A WIDE
RANGE OF INFORMATION MEDIA WHICH CAN BE ADAPTED AT LOW EXPENSE.
A GLANCE AT SOME DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN FRANCE.

NOTES ON 10 INFORMATION CENTRES IN PARIS, VISITED DURING A STATE SPONSORED
STUDY TRIP IN 1980. DETAILED ACCOUNTS ARE GIVEN OF STAFFING, USERS, LIBRARY
RESOURCES, CATALOGUING PROCEDURES, RESEARCH AND DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES,
REPROGRAPHIC SERVICES, INDEXING PROCEDURES, AND DATA BASE FACILITIES AT THE
NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (CNRS)'S 2 DOCUMENTATION CENTRES,
DEALING RESPECTIVELY WITH SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION, AND THE HUMAN
SCIENCES; AND AT DOCUMENTATION FRANCAISE'S INFORMATION BANK, BIPA. OTHER
CENTRES BRIEFLY SURVEYED INCLUDE THOSE SERVING THE FRENCH PETROLEUM INSTITUTE,
FRENCH LANGUAGE INSTITUTE, AUDIST, AFNOR, AND THE GUSTAVE ROUSSY INSTITUTE.
INFORMATION FOR DISTANCE EDUCATION' THE OPEN UNIVERSITY DISTANCE EDUCATION
INFORMATION PROJECT.

A PROJECT IN PROGRESS AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY IS STUDYING DISTANCE EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS AS PLACES OF WORK, WITH THE AIM OF ENABLING MEMBERS TO CONSIDER
IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION PROVISION IN THIS AREA. DESCRIPTIONS WERE
COLLECTED FROM PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF
INSTITUTION, USING THE VIGNETTE METHOD. A DISCUSSION PAPER WILL NOW BE
CIRCULATED TO PARTICIPANTS, PRESENTING THE GENERAL PICTURE WHICH EMERGES AND
RAISING ISSUES FOR INFORMATION PROVISION. THE BURDEN WILL BE THAT, VIEWING
DISTANCE EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IT IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AS A
SPECIALISM AND ALSO MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. THIS
SUGGESTS A CURRENT NEED FOR A RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE,
PROVIDED ON A DECENTRALISED BASIS, AS CONTRASTED WITH FORMAL INFORMATION
STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL FACILITIES FOR DISTANCE EDUCATION AS A WHOLE.
RD MEETING OF THE HEADS OF INFORMATION UNITS IN CULTURE AND ART FROM SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES.R

EPORTS ON THE MEETING OF THE HEADS OF INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE FIELD OF ARTS
AND CULTURE FROM SOCIALIST COUNTRIES (MOSCOW, NOV 80). MAIN TOPICS OF
DISCUSSION WERE MUTUAL COOPERATION OF THE CENTRES IN 1980; THE STATE AND
PERSPECTIVES OF DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTRES; THE PLANNING OF
COOPERATION IN 1981-85; AND A REVIEW OF ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST YEAR. FUTURE
COOPERATION EFFORTS WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION
SOURCES, ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT DATA BANK, AUTOMATION AND RESEARCH. SPECIAL
HELP WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTS AND CULTURE INFORMATION
SYSTEM IN VIETNAM.
A TOOL FOR ACCESSING SUBTERRANEAN LITERATURE. THE EXAMPLE OF THE MICRO-URBA
NETWORK.

AN ACCOUNT OF A FRENCH NETWORK, MICRO-URBA, DESIGNED TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO
MATERIAL IN HOUSING AND URBAN STUDIES FIELDS NOT COVERED BY ESTABLISHED MEANS
OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL, BY ESTABLISHING A LIBRARY ON MICROFICHE. DETAILS
ARE GIVEN OF HOW MATERIAL IS COLLECTED AND SELECTED FOR RETENTION, MANUFACTURE
OF MICROFICHES, CATALOGUING, AND DECENTRALISATION OF MANAGEMENT TASKS. THE
SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF URBAMET, A NATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK COVERING
HOUSING, URBAN STUDIES, THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT, IS DESCRIBED WITH
PARTICULARS OF MEMBER ORGANISATIONS, OBJECTIVES, DOCUMENT DELIVERY
ARRANGEMENTS, AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS, IN ALL OF WHICH MICROGRAPHY IS
ESSENTIAL. IN CONCLUSION THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROGRAPHY IS INFORMATION NETWORKS
ARE STRESSED AND WAYS OF MAXIMISING ITS POTENTIAL SUGGESTED.
BILL TO AMEND IRS CODE REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY OF TAX INFORMATION.

THE US BILL IS INTENDED TO STREAMLINE AND CLARIFY PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL
REVENUE SERVICE CODE GOVERNING ACCESS TO TAX INFORMATION FOR USE IN NON-TAX
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS. THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY AMBIGUITIES
IN EXISTING LAWS, REFINE NEEDLESSLY CUMBERSOME PROCEDURES, AND DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AS CONTRASTED WITH THOSE OF LEGAL
ENTITIES SUCH AS CORPORATIONS.
MEMORANDA OF LAW' PROBLEMS AND ALTERNATIVES IN ESTABLISHING MANUAL AND
AUTOMATED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.

LEGAL MEMORANDA, GENERATED IN-HOUSE, ARE IMPORTANT RESEARCH SOURCES IN A LAW
LIBRARY. THE PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP MANUAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERISED
SYSTEMS, BASED ON WORD PROCESSORS AND MINICOMPUTERS, ARE DISCUSSED ALONG WITH
THE USE OF SUBJECT INDEXING AND SUBJECT HEADING LISTS.
ACCESS TO THE LAW.

REPORT OF A CANADIAN SYMPOSIUM ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES, GOVERNMENT, THE LEGAL
PROFESSION AND THE MEDIA IN PROMOTING LEGAL LITERACY, HELD IN APR 81. THE
STATE OF PUBLIC LEGAL EDUCATION AND INFORMATION IN CANADA IS REVIEWED, AND THE
VIEWS OF THE SPEAKERS REPRESENTING THE ORGANISATIONS CONCERNED SUMMARISED. AN
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF 16 ITEMS ON LEGAL MATERIALS AND THEIR USE IN
LIBRARIES IS APPENDED.
MAPPING THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT OF POLICY-MAKERS' SOME EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
FROM NIGERIA.

A REVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF NIGERIA'S FEDERAL CIVIL SERVICE AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION TRANSFER AMONG PUBLIC POLICY-MAKERS FORMS THE
BACKGROUND FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE DIVERGENCE IN THE OFFICIAL CONCEPTUALISATION
OF INFORMATION AND THE USUAL CONCEPTUALISATION OF INFORMATION BY LIBRARIANS
AND INFORMATION SPECIALISTS. SUGGESTIONS AIMED AT BRIDGING THIS GAP ARE
PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED WITH A VIEW TO INTEGRATING ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, HARD
INFORMATION IN THE POLICY ANALYSIS ENVIRONMENT OF CIVIL SERVANTS.
THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION DEBATE IN AUSTRALIA.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION HAS BEEN A CATCHCRY IN AUSTRALIA FOR A DECADE NOW.
DESPITE PERSISTENT LOBBYING NO ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED.
DISCUSSES A BILL INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT IN 1978, MENTIONING US AND UK
INFLUENCES. AN AFTERWORD DESCRIBES PROGRESS OF THE BILL THROUGH THE SENATE.
NEIGHBOURHOOD INFORMATION CENTRES AND COMMUNITY WORKERS.

EXAMINES REASONS WHY COMMUNITY WORKERS IN THE UK GET INVOLVED IN NEIGHBOURHOOD
INFORMATION AND ADVICE CENTRES, DESCRIBES THE FORM THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT
OFTEN TAKES AND TRIES TO SHOW HOW UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ON THE PART OF SOME
COMMUNITY WORKERS HAVE LIMITED AND DISGUISED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THESE
CENTRES.
A GENERIC I AND R CENTER SERVES SPECIALIZED NEEDS.

THE INFORMATION CENTER OF HAMPTON ROADS IS A REGIONAL HUMAN SERVICES
INFORMATION SYSTEM SCANNING 9 CITIES AND 6 COUNTIES IN SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA.
ITS EXPERIENCE IS DISCUSSED TO SUPPORT THE PREMISE THAT SPECIALISED
INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS CAN BE MORE
EFFECTIVELY PROVIDED AS A COMPONENT OF A SOUND GENERIC INFORMATION AND
REFERRAL SYSTEM THAN IF SEPARATELY ORGANISED. SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED ARE
BEING INTEGRATED INTO ITS PROGRAMME.
THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL I AND R SYSTEMS' A STUDY OF DIVERSITY.

THE EMERGENCE OF INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SYSTEMS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
LEVEL IS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIAL SERVICE POLICY. ANALYSES
CHARACTERISTICS OF LOCAL INFORMATION AND REFERRAL AGENCIES IN OHIO. RESPONSES
TO A MAILED QUESTIONNAIRE INDICATE SIGNIFICANT VARIATION AMONG AGENCIES
REGARDING VOLUME OF INQUIRIES, SOURCES AND AMOUNTS OF FUNDING, SERVICES
PROVIDED, AND LEVELS OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF.
COMMUNITY INFORMATION SYSTEMS: ANALYSIS OF AN AGENCY REFERRAL PROGRAM.

(FIRST PUBLISHED IN 2JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY1, (1) 1979, 281-289).
ANALYSES THE EFFECTS OF AN INFORMATION REFERRAL TRAINING PROGRAMME AT PENN
HOUSE, A NEIGHBOURHOOD SERVICE CENTRE IN LAWRENCE, KANSAS. RESULTS SHOW THAT
BOTH THE % OF OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED REFERRAL BEHAVIOURS AND THE PROPORTION
OF REFERRALS TO AN APPROPRIATE AGENCY INCREASED AFTER TRAINING. DEMONSTRATES
AN EFFECTIVE PROCEDURE FOR TRAINING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY SERVICE WORKERS TO
PROVIDE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS.

2 ARTICLES ABOUT THE EXPERIMENTAL (MAR-AUG 81) LIAISON BETWEEN THE SCOTTISH
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION'S RADIO SCOTLAND
SERIES NICKETY-NACKETY, A DAILY PROGRAMME FOR THE UNDER-5S. NICKETY-NACKETY,
BY IRENE KAY, EXPLAINS HOW THE PROGRAMME'S WEEKLY MESSAGE BAG (A 5-6 MINUTE
INFORMATION SLOT AIMED AT THE ADULT AUDIENCE) HAS BEEN LINKED WITH THE
PROVISION OF COMMUNITY INFORMATION IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION BROADCASTING AND
THE COMMUNITY, OR FROM MESSAGE BAG TO THE MICRO, BY JANE ANDERSON AND JOHN
MCCORMICK, DISCUSSES THE LINK FROM THE BBC'S VIEWPOINT AND CONSIDERS THE ROLE
OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING IN GENERAL.
COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOUR IN TWO ENGLISH TOWNS.

PRESENTS RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF INFORMATION NEEDS AND INFORMATION-SEEKING
BEHAVIOUR OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THE COMPARABLE UK TOWNS SWINDON AND
NORWICH, UNDERTAKEN BY THE CENTRE FOR MASS COMMUNICATION RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY
OF LEICESTER WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LONG RANGE INTELLIGENCE DIVISION OF THE
POST OFFICE, AND AIMED AT ASSISTING IN FORECASTING FUTURE DEMAND FOR
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SERVICES. CONCLUDES THAT PEOPLE PREFER INSTITUTIONAL
SOURCES TO BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE, WELL ORGANISED, ATTRACTIVE AND EASY TO USE
AND THAT THEY SHOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT IS COMPLETE, RELIABLE, ACCURATE
AND NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. REAL DIFFERENCES SHOWED UP BETWEEN VARIOUS
SOCIAL GROUPS IN THEIR ABILITY TO RECOGNISE INFORMATION NEEDS AND TO USE
EXISTING INFORMATION SOURCES.
INFORMATION ON 'CHILDREN IN DIFFICULTY' IN QUEBEC.A

 DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE MONTREAL CENTRE FOR INFORMATION ON CHILD
HEALTH, (CENTRE D'INFORMATION SUR LA SANTE DE L'ENFANT) FORMERLY THE CIEAL.
CLARIFIES THE TERM 'CHILDREN IN DIFFICULTY' USED IN QUEBEC, WITH REFERENCE TO
OTHER EQUIVALENT TERMS IN USE IN EUROPE AND USA. THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
INVOLVED IN SERVICE PROVISION, AND THE OFFICIAL DEFINITIONS OF THE CLIENT
POPULATION, ARE EXPLAINED. SINCE THE FIELD IS NECESSARILY MULTIDISCIPLINARY,
THE WORK OF THE CENTRE IS COMPLEX. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ITS ORGANISATION IN
1968; LIBRARY RESOURCES; INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND PUBLICATION ACTIVITIES;
SEARCH SERVICES; COLLECTIONS OF AUDIO-VISUAL AND SPECIAL MATERIALS; AND
SPECIALISED INDEXING AND CATALOGUING ACTIVITIES. THE INFORMATION NETWORK
INITIATED BY THE CENTRE USING A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED THESAURUS FOR DOCUMENT
ORGANISATION IS DESCRIBED IN FULL, AND COOPERATIVE RELATIONS WITH OTHER FRENCH
AND ENGLISH SPEAKING AGENCIES IN TH E FIELD, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL, ARE
OUTLINED. FINALLY REFERENCE IS MADE TO PLANS FOR ESTABLISHING AN INTERNATIONAL
INFORMATION NETWORK.
EPIE'S PROGRAMS AND SERVICES' SLJ INTERVIEWS KEN KOMOSKI.

REPORTS AN INTERVIEW WITH KEN KOMOSKI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATIONAL
PRODUCTS INFORMATION EXCHANGE (EPIE), A NON-PROFIT, CONSUMER SUPPORTED,
UNBIASED INSTITUTE, WHICH IS CHARTERED BY THE REGENTS OF NEW YORK STATE.
DESCRIBES BRIEFLY EPIE'S SERVICES TO EDUCATORS AND LIBRARIANS, WHICH INCLUDE'
INFORMATION ON CONSUMER EDUCATIONAL ISSUES; EVALUATION OF TEXTBOOKS,
AUDIO-VISUAL EQUIPMENT, AND NON-PROFIT MATERIALS; AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING.
DISCUSSES SOME OF THE REASONS WHY SO MANY US LIBRARIANS ARE UNAWARE OF EPIE'S
SERVICES.
THE RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK STI SYSTEM IN THE PERIOD OF
THE 6TH 5-YEAR PLAN.

THE MAIN DIRECTIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK STI SYSTEM IN THE
YEARS 1976-80 WERE DETERMINED BY THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE INFORMATION
PROGRAMME. NEW BRANCH INFORMATION CENTRES WERE ESTABLISHED IN SEVERAL BRANCHES
OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, THUS BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BRANCH CENTRES TO
2,081 AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THEIR STAFF TO 9,271 IN 1980. THE DEVELOPMENT OF
AUTOMATED PROCESSING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WAS
INFLUENCED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTRAL TECHNOLOGICAL BASE (CTB) OF COSTEI
IN PRAGUE. 11 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA BASES FROM ABROAD AND 9 DOMESTIC ONES ARE
USED IN VARIOUS BRANCHES AND SUBJECT. CTB OPERATES 2 DATA BASES OF CENTRAL
INVENTORIES (RESEARCH REPORTS AND DISSERTATIONS, AND, REPORTS OF BUSINESS
JOURNEYS), A UNION CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND THE SLOVAK NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY. SOME SELECTED PROCESSES OF SEVERAL MAJOR LIBRARIE S WERE ALSO
COMPUTERISED IN THE GIVEN PERIOD.
THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' ANALYTICAL CASE-STUDIES.

UNESCO AND THE UNITED NATIONS INTERIM FUND FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR
DEVELOPMENT (IFSTD) HAVE UNDERTAKEN A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE REAL NEEDS AND
OPTIONS FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN 8 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE CONCLUSIONS
OF THE ANALYTICAL CASE-STUDIES ON THESE COUNTRIES ARE GIVEN.
CENTRES FOR ACQUISITION AND DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION' THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF UNIVERSITIES INFORMATION POLICY.

AS PART OF THE PROJECTED FRENCH NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, THE 1ST STAGE OF
THE CADIST PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JAN 81, WHEN 10 UNIVERSITIES TOOK
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN 11
DESIGNATED FIELDS. EVENTUALLY 20 UNIVERSITIES WILL COVER A TOTAL OF 30 SUBJECT
AREAS, OBTAINING THE MOST COMPLETE INFORMATION AND SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO
PRIMARY SOURCES. THE REASONS FOR CHOOSING THIS KIND OF SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO
THE UK OR GERMAN MODELS, THE SELECTION OF CENTRES AND THEIR MANDATE, AND THEIR
RIGHTS AND DUTIES AS OFFICIALLY PRESCRIBED, ARE DISCUSSED.
PROPOSAL FOR ESTABLISHING A BELGIAN COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.

IN ORDER TO COORDINATE AND DEVELOP THE ACTIVITIES OF PRODUCERS OF SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION, SUCH AS UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTRES, AND LIBRARIES AND
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES, IN PROMOTING ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION, WITHIN THE
BELGIAN FRENCH COMMUNITY, AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE AND CONSULTATIVE BODY
SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED UNDER GOVERNMENT AUSPICES. 7 ARTICLES ARE ADVANCED TO
COVER THE INSTITUTION OF SUCH A COUNCIL, COVERING REPRESENTATION, ELECTION,
POWERS AND DUTIES, RELATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT, FINANCE, AND OFFICIAL AUDIT.
DOCUMENTATION SPECIALISTS AND QUEBEC GOVERNMENT POLICY ON SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION.

DISCUSSES RECENT QUEBEC GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL
INFORMATION NETWORK, AND THE REACTIONS OF THE 2 CHIEF QUEBEC LIBRARIANS
ASSOCIATIONS, ASTED AND CBPQ. GOVERNMENT POLICY AS SET FORTH IN A RECENT WHITE
PAPER IS OUTLINED, AND THE RESPONSES FROM ASTED AND CBPQ SUMMARISED. THE
GOVERNMENT INTENTION TO DEMOCRATISE SCIENCE BY EDUCATION AND POPULARISATION IS
GENERALLY APPROVED, BUT CRITICISM IS MADE OF THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION
PROCEDURES. IN EMPHASISING THE NECESSITY OF LOCAL DECISION-MAKING IN THE
CREATION OF INFORMATION NETWORKS, THE IMPORTANCE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND A
GLOBAL ORIENTATION IS BEING IGNORED.
INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.

ONE OF THE WAYS OF INCREASING THE CONTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
SERVICES TO SCIENTIFIC CREATIVE WORK IS THROUGH THEIR IDENTIFICATION WITH THE
LOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH
PROCESS. COOPERATION ITSELF BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INFORMATION WORKERS CAN BEGIN
EVEN BEFORE THERE IS A SPECIFIC RESEARCH TASK; SOME INSTITUTIONS HAVE
EXPERIMENTED WITH THE POLICY THAT EACH NEW RESEARCHER HAS TO SPEND A MONTH OR
2 IN THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT. THE COOPERATION GOES THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES,
FROM THE PRELIMINARY SEARCH TO AVOID DUPLICATION IN RESEARCH TO THE CLOSER
COLLABORATION OF BOTH PARTNERS' TEAMS. SOMETIMES THE COLLABORATION IS SO CLOSE
THAT AN INFORMATION SCIENTIST BECOMES A CO-AUTHOR.
DISSEMINATION OF THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL TRIAL' AN
ANALYSIS OF THE CITING LITERATURE.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CITATION ANALYSIS STUDY OF AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL
TRIAL WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A TECHNIQUE FOR TREATING
DIABETICS. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE WHY THIS TECHNIQUE WAS STILL
NOT WELL KNOWN 18 MONTHS AFTER ITS PUBLICATION. CONCLUDES THAT A LARGE NUMBER
OF CITATIONS IN THE LITERATURE TO A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PAPER DO NOT OF
ITSELF ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION REPORTED WILL READILY REACH THE APPROPRIATE
PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. STRESSES THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR THE
RAPID DISSEMINATION OF IMPORTANT NEW FINDINGS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SUPPORT FOR THE COMPLEX PROGRAMME 'SIBERIA'.

IN 1977 THE SIBIRSKOE OTDELENIE AKADEMII NAUK (SIBERIAN DEPARTMENT OF THE
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES) LAUNCHED A MAJOR LONG TERM RESEARCH PROGRAMME ENTITLED
'COMPLEX OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN SIBERIA'. RESULTS FROM THE RESEARCH WILL BE
USED IN PLANNING THE UTILISATION OF SIBERIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES. IN SUPPORT OF
THE PROGRAMME A BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE
ACADEMY'S LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES TO ASSIST SCIENTISTS IN THEIR WORK
ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. TYPES AND FORMS OF SERVICES PROVIDED WITHIN THE SYSTEM
ARE DESCRIBED.
THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT AND TASKS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SERVICE IN THE FRIEDRICH EBERT ELECTRICAL GOODS FACTORY COMBINE IN BERLIN.

BY THE END OF 1982 THE INFORMATION SERVICE WILL HAVE COMPLETED THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTRAL COMPUTERISED DOCUMENTARY AND DATA SEARCH SYSTEM,
EXPANSION OF STOCKS AND SERVICES AND REORGANISATION OF WORK SHARING
PROCEDURES. THE MAIN INFORMATION CENTRE COORDINATES THE WORK OF 26 DIFFERENT
INFORMATION SERVICES WITHIN THE COMBINE AND PROVIDES LINKS WITH THE NATIONAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ELECTROTECHNOLOGY. INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL ARE
PARTLY MECHANISED AND PARTLY MANUAL. EMPHASIS IS LAID ON THE PROVISION OF
INFORMATION FOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SPECIFIC
PROCESSES; STUDIES OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE PRODUCED AND A MONTHLY
BULLETIN INCLUDES RELEVANT NEW ARTICLES FROM PERIODICALS AND OTHER SOURCES ON
NEW PROCESSES. INFORMATION STOCKS COMPRISE MAINLY MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS WILL IN CLUDE THE EXTENSION OF THE RANGE OF MICROFILM
EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES.
ON THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN A FACTORY
COMBINE.

MICROELECTRONICS HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE OVER MOST CONTEMPORARY INDUSTRIAL
WORKING PROCESSES, INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE FLOW OF MATERIAL, ENERGY AND
INFORMATION BUT ALSO GENERAL ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT. THUS IT IS CLEAR
THAT THE STAFF OF SPECIALIST RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS HAVE A GREATER NEED THAN
EVER BEFORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF INFORMATION. EXAMPLES OF THIS NEED AND
SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS RATIONAL SATISFACTION ARE PRESENTED WITH REFERENCE TO
EXPERIENCES IN A STRIP STEEL FACTORY CONCERNING THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS, STATISTICS
AND MANAGEMENT. THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY; ITS
POTENTIAL IN LARGE SCALE INFORMATION STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION IS NOT YET
FULLY EXPLOITED.
A MORE EFFECTIVE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE TYRE
INDUSTRY IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.

THE INFORMATION CENTRE AT FURSTENWALDE, EAST GERMANY COORDINATES WORK WITH
SUBJECT EXPERTS IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE TYRE INDUSTRY. INFORMATION
SERVICES HERE ARE A PART OF THE NATIONAL CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH IS
LINKED IN TURN WITH SERVICES IN OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. THE CENTRE
PUBLISHES A MONTHLY JOURNAL CONTAINING ABSTRACTS AND PATENT INFORMATION; OTHER
SERVICES INCLUDE SELECTIVE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING,
LITERATURE SURVEYS AND THE PUBLICATION OF REPORTS. DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR
1981-85 PROPOSE' CLOSER COOPERATION WITH TECHNOLOGICAL POLICY; A WIDER RANGE
OF SOURCE MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY FROM THE USSR; INCREASED COOPERATION WITH
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS; BETTER MANAGEMENT; THE USE OF
AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING; AND HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS FOR STAFF.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN A PREDOMINANTLY
NON-LITERATE SOCIETY WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL
DEVELOPMENT.

PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE FID/EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMITTEE MEETING, IBADAN,
NIGERIA, 6-9 MAY 81. 'COMMUNICATION AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION IN
NON-LITERATE SOCIETIES', BY B. OLABIMPE ABOYADE; 'DETERMINANTS OF AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTIVITY AMONG NON-LITERATE FARMERS-THE NIGERIAN CASE', BY FRANCIS S.
IDACHABA; 'THE AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION INFORMATION WORKER' HIS METHODS AND

THE TRANSFER OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION TO RURAL COMMUNITIES', BY STEPHAN M.
LAWANI.
EXPERIENCES AT THE CONTROL CENTRE OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON AGRICULTURE AND
FOOD IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.

2 TYPES OF STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION AND THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN
INFORMATION WORK ARE DESCRIBED WHICH HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES HELPFUL IN THE
CREATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE SUBJECT AREAS OF
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FOOD ECONOMICS AND THEIR USE IS ILLUSTRATED WITH
REFERENCE TO INFORMATION ON MILK MARKETING AND GENERAL COOPERATION WITHIN THE
SYSTEM ON THE ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD. IT IS CLEAR THAT, THROUGH
UNIFIED AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL COMPETENCE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE INFORMATION
SERVICES INVOLVED, THROUGH WORK SHARING, SPECIALISATION AND COOPERATION, AN
IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE, QUALITY AND RELATED EFFECTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED IN
THE PRESENTATION AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION.
INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT.

DEMONSTRATES HOW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES CAN
BE USED IN ADMINISTRATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION IN DECISION MAKING IS
DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO THE MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATING
ACCESS TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND ENSURING THAT EXPLOITATION IS COST
EFFECTIVE. PROPOSES A PRACTICAL MODEL FOR ORGANISING AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION
SERVICE, SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO DRAW ON ALL AVAILABLE EXISTING INFORMATION
NETWORKS IN AN ORGANISATION, THROUGH A COMMON CODIFICATION. THEN DISCUSSES
CODIFICATION OPERATIONS, EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDISATION HERE IF
THE INFORMATION SYSTEM IS TO FUNCTION SUCCESSFULLY.
LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES.

DISCUSSES HOW THE LIBRARIAN CAN SERVE THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A SPECIALISED
TYPE OF ORGANISATION AND CONSIDERS HOW INFORMATION IS USED IN GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, ITS IMPORTANCE AS A RESOURCE, AND WHAT INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT INVOLVES. THE LIBRARIAN ACCORDINGLY MUST ADAPT HIS SKILLS TO THE
DEMANDS OF THE PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT, WHERE INVOLVEMENT IN INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT AND THE ORGANISATION'S OPERATIONS REQUIRES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN
PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT. SUGGESTS HOW SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS
COULD SHARE INFORMATION RESOURCES THROUGH NETWORK COOPERATION, AND ILLUSTRATES
THE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING ORGANISATION OPERATIONS. FINALLY EMPHASISES
THE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTING TRAINING PROGRAMMES TO RECOGNISE THE KIND OF
DEMANDS THE LIBRARIAN WILL MEET IN THIS CONTEXT.
MEDIATOR': A NEW ROLE FOR AV LIBRARIANS.D

ESCRIBES THE GROWING US DEMAND FOR INFORMATION WORK IN THE MASS MEDIA. BRIEFLY
LISTS USEFUL REFERENCE WORKS, BIBLIOGRAPHIES, ARCHIVES AND OTHER SOURCES OF
INFORMATION ON THE MASS MEDIA.
THE INCORPORATION OF PATENT INFORMATION IN THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON CIVIL
ENGINEERING.

IF MORE INFORMATION ON PATENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE CIVIL ENGINEERING
INFORMATION SYSTEM, WIDER AND MORE RATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WILL RESULT AND MORE
HELP CAN BE GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES SHOULD PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION OF LITERATURE,
SEARCHING, SELECTIVE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMAL STOCK
OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MATERIAL ON PATENTS, AN EXPRESS COPYING SERVICE,
PRODUCTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND COOPERATION WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION
SERVICES. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD SHOW IMPROVED COOPERATION WITH OTHER
PATENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND WITH SERVICE USERS AND MORE RESEARCH INTO
TERMINOLOGY AND STAFF TRAINING METHODS. THE SYSTEM SHOULD RELEASE SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH WORKERS FROM MUCH ROUTINE WORK.
DOCUMENTATION PROBLEMS FOR THE HISTORY OF ART IN JAPAN.

DISCUSSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE HISTORY OF ART IN
JAPAN. TRACES DEVELOPMENTS OF THE HISTORICAL STUDY OF ART IN JAPAN, AND
INDICATES SOME OF ITS CHARACTERISTICS. REVEALS THAT DOCUMENTATION ACTIVITIES
IN ART MUSEUMS, GALLERIES, LIBRARIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES IN JAPAN HAVE
BEEN INFLUENCED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS. SURVEYS LITERATURE AND DOCUMENTS IN
THE HISTORY OF ART. CONCLUDES WITH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE DOCUMENTATION
PROBLEMS.
OECD GUIDELINES ON PRIVACY PROTECTION AND TRANSBORDER FLOWS.

THE GUIDELINES APPLY TO BOTH AUTOMATED AND MANUALLY-STORED PERSONAL DATA, BOTH
IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. OECD BELIEVES THERE IS A DANGER THAT LEGAL
DISPARITIES COULD HAMPER THE FREE FLOW OF PERSONAL DATA ACROSS FRONTIERS, AND
THAT RESTRICTIONS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DISRUPTION IN SUCH AREAS AS BANKING,
INSURANCE, AIRCRAFT RESERVATIONS, AND THE DISPATCH OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA
BETWEEN PARENT COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY IN MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES. THE FULL
TEXT OF THE GUIDELINES IS REPRINTED.
THE ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION POLICY.

EXCERPT FROM THE US NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION AGENCY'S NEW
STUDY EXAMINING ISSUES FACING INFORMATION POLICYMAKERS. DISCUSSES THE
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING A FREE MARKET ECONOMY; THE FUNCTIONING OF
INFORMATION MARKETS; MARKET INTERFERENCES RESULTING FROM THE ATYPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION; THE CONFLICT BETWEEN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF
INFORMATION AND A FREE MARKET FOR INFORMATION; INCENTIVES TO CREATE
INFORMATION; AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. EXPLAINS THE ROLE AND ACTIVITIES OF
THE US GOVERNMENT IN THIS AREA.

THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT.

THIS SERIES OF ARTICLES DESCRIBES RESEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN UNDERWAY AT THE OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP A FUNDAMENTAL AND GENERAL THEORY OF
INFORMATION FLOW AND ANALYSIS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH ATTEMPTS TO (1)
IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY IMPORTANT VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS IN THE INFORMATION
FLOW PROCESS; (2) ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THESE VARIABLES; (3) APPLY THE
THEORY TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS AND TO EXAMINE THE RESULTING IMPLICATIONS; AND
(4) DEVELOP MODELS, BOTH SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL, TO UTILISE AND VALIDATE
THE THEORY.

INFORMATION-RELATED BILLS INTRODUCED IN THE U.S. SENATE.

5 NEW BILLS-THE PUBLIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT, NATIONAL DRIVER REGISTER ACT,
TELEVISION LICENSING AND RENEWAL ACT, EQUAL ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS ACT, AND
HEARING IMPAIRED TAX INCENTIVE ACT-HAVE BEEN READ IN THE US SENATE AND
ASSIGNED TO THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES FOR ACTION. DESCRIBES EACH ACT BRIEFLY,
AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE WORLD OF INFORMATION.
BARRIERS TO INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION FLOW.

PRESENTS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SUBCOMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT INFORMATION AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CONCERNING
INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION FLOW. BARRIERS INCLUDE RESTRICTION ON USE OF
TECHNOLOGY, LIMITATIONS ON ENTRY OF COMPANIES INTO FOREIGN MARKETS, TARIFFS,
AND RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING TRANSMITTED INFORMATION. EVEN
GREATER BARRIERS ARE PREDICTED. THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS ON
THE NEED FOR BETTER ORGANISATION AND REPRESENTATION OF US INTERESTS WORLDWIDE
AND A COHERENT US POLICY.
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS AS A HINDRANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCUMENTATION
SERVICES.

DISCUSSES WHY DOCUMENTATION SERVICES AT PRESENT ARE MEETING ADMINISTRATIVE
OPPOSITION TO EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, WITH
REFERENCE TO CLASSICAL ORGANISATION THEORY. EXAMINES THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND
ECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF
SERVICES, AND PROPOSES THAT ORGANISATION PERFORMANCE BE RATED ACCORDING TO ITS
USE, NOT ITS OBJECTIVES. IF THIS IS ACCEPTED, THE INCREASED USE OF INFORMATION
NETWORKS WOULD PROVIDE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT PROBLEMS, BUT CERTAINLY
GREATER EMPHASIS ON MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IS ESSENTIAL IN TRAINING INFORMATION
PROFESSIONALS.
BAKER'S STRATEGY FLOUNDERS.

A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE UK'S MINISTER FOR INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY KENNETH BAKER DURING HIS 1ST YEAR OF OFFICE, INCLUDING INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY YEAR. LOOKS PARTICULARLY AT PLANS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND
LIST PROJECTS OF 1981. WITHOUT THE POLITICAL MUSCLE OF A FULL MINISTRY WITH
ITS OWN BUDGET AND INFLUENCE IN THE CABINET, EVERYTHING BAKER TRIES TO DO WILL
INEVITABLY BE TACTICAL RATHER THAN STRATEGIC, AND RESPONSIVE RATHER THAN TRULY
INITIATING.
USER EDUCATION-FOR LIFE?.

USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES FALL INTO 2 CATEGORIES. THEY MAY AIM SIMPLY TO HELP
THE STUDENT THROUGH HIS COURSE AND FAMILIARISE HIM WITH A SINGLE LIBRARY
(SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES), OR TO PROVIDE A FULLER AWARENESS OF THE GENERATION,
ROLE, AND USE OF INFORMATION WHICH MAY ALLOW HIM TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN ANY
SUBSEQUENT PROFESSIONAL SITUATION (LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES). ARGUES THAT THE
LATTER ARE MORE VALUABLE; THE OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARIAN AND STUDENT ON SUCH
COURSES ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. A USER EDUCATION COURSE BASED ON LONG-TERM
OBJECTIVES IS DESCRIBED, AND ITS EFFECTS ON STUDENT AND LIBRARY DISCUSSED.
FINALLY, THE CONTRIBUTION OF USER EDUCATION TO THE 'INFORMATION SOCIETY' IS
CONSIDERED, AND USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES WITH LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES PREFERRED.
BIOLOGY LIBRARY WORKBOOK.

A LIBRARY SKILLS WORKBOOK PROVIDES COLLEGE BIOLOGY STUDENTS WITH AN
INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGICAL LIBRARY RESOURCES. DIVIDED INTO 2 SECTIONS, THE 1ST
CONTAINS EXPLANATIONS OF THE VARIOUS STEPS IN THE LIBRARY RESEARCH PROCESS.
THE 2ND CONSISTS OF EXERCISES KEYED TO THE EXPLANATORY CHAPTERS OF THE 1ST
SECTION. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSES FOR USER EDUCATION.

EXAMINES THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS OF USER EDUCATION IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER EDUCATION CLEARINGHOUSES WHICH HAVE BEEN
ESTABLISHED TO HELP COPE WITH THESE PROBLEMS. DISCUSSES THE FUNCTION, AND
METHODS OF ACQUISITION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION OF 3 NATIONAL
CLEARINGHOUSES-THE USER CLEARINGHOUSE IN AUSTRALIA, THE LOEX CLEARINGHOUSE IN
THE USA, AND THE CLEARINGHOUSE OPERATED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY INFORMATION
OFFICER FOR USER EDUCATION IN THE UK.
YOUR NAU LIBRARY WORKBOOK. DISCOVERY SERIES NO. 22.

AN ILLUSTRATED LIBRARY SKILLS WORKBOOK INTRODUCES STUDENTS TO THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, ITS COLLECTIONS, FINDING TOOLS, AND LIBRARY RESEARCH PROCESSES. IT
INCLUDES A LIBRARY TOUR; AN INTRODUCTION TO REFERENCE WORKS; USE OF THE
CATALOGUE, SUBJECT HEADINGS, AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS; FAMILIARISATION WITH
PERIODICALS, GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, AND MICROFILMS; FACILITIES AND SERVICES
AVAILABLE AT THE REFERENCE DESK; AND A TERM PAPER GUIDE. AN APPENDIX PROVIDES
A SELECTED LIST OF SUBJECT AREA REFERENCE SOURCES BY CALL NUMBER OR LOCATION.
REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION' AN UNDERDEVELOPED AREA IN THE WORLD OF
EDUCATION.

CREATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY FASHIONABLE; IN INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE PRODUCED A VAST QUANTITY OF LITERATURE, MOST OF WHICH
MUST ULTIMATELY BE DISCARDED FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. NEVERTHELESS THESE
ACTIVITIES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE EACH STUDENT AND RESEARCHER SHOULD OFFER HIS
IDEAS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR EXAMINATION; SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS TOUCH ON SEVERAL
DISCIPLINES AND SO REQUIRE MULTILATERAL PLANNING; AND NEGLECTING TO STUDY
CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE CAN PROVE COSTLY OR CAN RESULT IN VAGUE,
UTOPIAN PROJECTS. YOUNG SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS MUST DEVOTE TIME TO
LITERATURE STUDY; TRAINING AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND IN THE FACTORY OR RESEARCH
CENTRE IS NEEDED. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRES MUST BE USER-ORIENTED.
INTRODUCTION OF STANDARDS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PRACTICE.

REVIEWS THE WORK OF THE KNIZHNAYA PALATA USSR (THE UKRAINIAN BOOK CHAMBER) IN
THE FIELD OF STANDARDISATION. THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
WORK AND PUBLISHING WAS 1 OF THE MAIN TOPICS OF THE CHAMBER'S RESEARCH
PROGRAMME IN THE PERIOD 1976-80. ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE CHAMBER COOPERATED
WITH THE VSESOYUZNAYA KNIZHNAYA PALATA (ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER) AND THE
GOSUDARSTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA SSSR IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATE LIBRARY) IN THE
PREPARATION OF STANDARDS FOR DOCUMENTATION, BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION,
CATALOGUING DESCRIPTION, PUBLICATION TERMINOLOGY AND ABBREVIATIONS. ON THE
REPUBLICAN LEVEL THE CHAMBER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPLICATION OF STANDARDS
IN UKRAINIAN PUBLISHING.
THE ACQUISITION OF AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION-A TASK FOR
LIBRARIES?.

LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACQUIRING 2INFORMATIONSMITTEL1 AS DEFINED
BY GEORG SCHMOLL SUPPLYING A SUMMARISED FORM OF INFORMATION SOURCES AND
PRESENTING IT TO THE USER IN A PRACTICAL FORM. AT PRESENT THIS TYPE OF
MATERIAL (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, INCLUDING LIBRARY CATALOGUES) IS NOT
COLLECTED BY LIBRARIES IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AS IT IS OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE
THROUGH NORMAL MARKET SOURCES VIA PUBLISHERS. AS INFORMATION MATERIAL IS
GENERALLY IN A PROCESSED FORM, LIBRARIES DO NOT ALWAYS CLASSIFY THE CONTENTS
FURTHER. HOWEVER, THE FORM IN WHICH THE MATERIAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE USER
IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE INDEPENDENT USE OF THE
INFORMATION. OFTEN THE MATERIAL IS CLASSIFIED TO BE USED BY PARTICULAR USER
GROUPS, FIRMS, LIBRARY COLLECTIVES OR SECTORS OF THE INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. LIBRARIES MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH USER GROUPS
NEED WHICH INFORMATION MATERIAL IN THEIR AREA AND ALSO WORK WITH OTHER
LIBRARIES TO PROVIDE A LARGER SELECTION OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
INFORMATION MATERIAL.
PROBLEMS OF IMPROVING BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE USSR.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE USSR IS REVIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISIONS OF
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 2ON FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF
IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL EDUCATION1. MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS OF SEVERAL LIBRARIES
AND INFORMATION CENTRES IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK INCLUDE
THOSE IN THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, CENTRALISED CATALOGUING AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SERVICES TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THOSE ASPECTS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK NOT
DEVELOPED TO A SATISFACTORY LEVEL ARE' CHILDREN'S BIBLIOGRAPHY, PLANNING AND
COORDINATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK AND THE USE OF RESOURCES. AN IMPORTANT
ROLE WILL BE PLAYED BY AUTOMATION IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
PROCESSES.
BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS.

REPORTS ON THE CONFERENCE 'ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN THE
USSR' HELD IN OCT 80. THE MAIN TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THE CONFERENCE WERE' THE
SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION; STUDENTS AND BIBLIOGRAPHY;
PUBLISHING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES; STANDARDISATION IN INFORMATION SCIENCE,
BIBLIOGRAPHY, LIBRARIANSHIP AND PUBLISHING; INFORMATION SERVICES ON STANDARDS
AND PATENTS; CENTRALISED CATALOGUING; VSESOYUZNAYA KNIZHNAYA PALATA (ALL-UNION
BOOK CHAMBER) AND ITS BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCE WORK; RETROSPECTIVE COMPILATION
OF INDEXES TO SERIALS; USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC SOURCES; BOOK TRADE; AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL TRAINING OF PERSONNEL AND OTHERS.
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND PUBLICATIONS IN THE CANADIAN
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY' DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION CENTRE.

IDENTIFIES THE MAJOR PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY AN AGENCY SUCH AS THE CANADIAN
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (CIDA) IN GAINING ACCESS TO OFFICIAL
DOCUMENTS AND PROPOSES WAYS OF IMPROVING THEIR BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL.
DESCRIBES CIDA, ITS PROGRAMMES, THE ROLE OF THE DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION CENTRE
AND THE METHODOLOGY CURRENTLY USED TO GIVE ACCESS TO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.
PROBLEMS WITH SOURCES OF INFORMATION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS' THE
CASE OF THE WORLD-WIDE TREATY JUNGLE.

LIBRARIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL GUIDANCE TO AND THROUGH THE
'TREATY JUNGLE' ENGENDERED BY THE DIVERSITY OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
INTERESTS CAUSED BY THE RECENT DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT
NATION STATES. THE DEGREE OF ACCESSIBILITY TO TREATY INFORMATION IS MUCH
GREATER THAN BEFORE' TREATY INFORMATION IS NO LONGER THE PRESERVE OF
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THANKS TO PUBLICATIONS LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS TREATY
SERIES. THERE IS STILL A NEED, HOWEVER, FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CURRENTLY
PUBLISHED TREATY COLLECTIONS AND TREATIES IN FORCE. THE MANY PROBLEMS STILL
FACED IN GAINING ACCESS TO TREATY INFORMATION CAN ONLY BE SOLVED BY
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND BETTER SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TREATY
SECTION.
RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY' AN IMPORTANT AID TO COMMUNIST EDUCATION.

MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE' TO ASSIST IN THE ORGANISATION
OF READING WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY; AND TO
ASSIST IN THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONNEL AND SPECIALISTS. A WELL
DEVELOPED THEORY OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY IS BROUGHT INTO PRACTICE THROUGH
THE UNIFIED SYSTEM OF RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE LEADING ROLE IS HELD, IN
THE SYSTEM, BY THE GOSUDARSTVENNAYA BIBLIOTEKA IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATE
LIBRARY) WHOSE WORK REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF RECOMMENDED
BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE COUNTRY. AS THE CENTRE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK AT THE
NATIONAL LEVEL, THE LIBRARY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORECASTING, PLANNING AND
DESIGN OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK IN LIBRARIES AND FOR THE PROVISION OF
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE IN THIS FIELD.
WHY ENGINEERS DON'T USE DATABASES.

SHORTENED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE IN 2MECHANICAL ENGINEERING1 MAR 81. CLAIMS
THAT US ENGINEERS LARGELY IGNORE COMPUTERISED DATA BANKS AND USE DATED AND
LIMITED INFORMATION SOURCES. THEY COLLECT MOST OF THEIR ADVANCED TECHNICAL
INFORMATION THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH VENDORS, SALESMEN, CONSULTANTS, AND THEIR
PEERS AND RESTRICT THEIR FORMAL READING TO THE MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OF
THEIR DESKS. THE CULPRIT IS THE INDEXING' THE MAJOR INDEXING SYSTEMS INDEX BY
SUBJECT OR THE NAME OF AN OBJECT, BUT AN ENGINEER WISHES TO RETRIEVE
INFORMATION INDEXED BY FUNCTION. ALSO, VITAL PRODUCT INFORMATION IS NOT
AVAILABLE ON A CREDITABLE DATA BASE.
THE USE OF SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES FOR PATENT INFORMATION.

THE EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIALLY ORIENTED PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES MEANS THAT
INFORMATION ON PATENTS MUST BE QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY IMPROVED,
WHICH PRESUPPOSES THE USE OF RATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING PATENT
DESCRIPTIONS. WITH EXAMPLES TAKEN FROM PATENT DESCRIPTIONS FROM EAST AND WEST
GERMANY, THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUBJECT DOCUMENTATION THROUGH THE
USE OF PRIMARY SOURCES OR ABSTRACTS ARE PRESENTED. GENERALLY THE BEST RESULTS
ARE ACHIEVED WHEN CONTENT ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN ABSTRACT OR SUMMARY; PRIMARY
SOURCES ARE OFTEN OF EXCELLENT QUALITY, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM EAST GERMANY,
BUT THEIR USE CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING.
DESIGNING SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES' REFLECTIONS ON A RESEARCH
PROJECT.

THE RESEARCH PROGRAMME 'DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES'
(DISISS) CONDUCTED A LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF SECONDARY SERIALS AND THEIR
EFFECTIVENESS AS INFORMATION SOURCES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. IN SEPARATE
INVESTIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS WERE STUDIED' (1) STRUCTURE, SIZE AND
INCREASE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES LITERATURE; (2) NATURE AND DEGREE OF COVERAGE AND
OVERLAP WITHIN THE SEPARATE DISCIPLINES AND AREAS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES; (3)
DESIGN, EFFECTIVENESS AND USE OF SECONDARY SERVICES; AND (4) AN ANALYSIS OF
THE CONCENTRATION AND SCATTERING WITHIN THE SUBJECT AREAS, LANGUAGES, AND DATE
DISTRIBUTION OF CITATIONS APPEARING IN SOCIAL SCIENCE MATERIALS. SUGGESTIONS
ARE MADE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS.
ON THE WORK OF THE INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN THE USA.

DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE AND WORK OF THE INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
FOUNDED IN THE USA IN 1960 BY E. GARFIELD. THE INSTITUTE IS A COMMERCIAL
ESTABLISHMENT SPECIALISING IN THE COMPILATION AND PUBLICATION OF SECONDARY
INFORMATION SOURCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. A LARGE DATA BASE SUPPORTS THE
PROVISION OF A SERIES OF CURRENT INFORMATION SERVICES. A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW
OF THE INSTITUTE'S PUBLICATIONS IS FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR COVERAGE
OF PRIMARY MATERIALS. THE WORK OF THE INSTITUTE HAS BEEN MADE KNOWN IN THE
USSR THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AT VARIOUS BOOK FAIRS AND SEVERAL LARGE INFORMATION
CENTRES AND AROSE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST AMONG SOVIET SPECIALISTS.
LINGUISTIC SUPPORT IN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

AIMS TO SHOW THE CURRENT POSITION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTIC
SUPPORT, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE STATE AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION (GASNTI). THE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF LINGUISTIC
SUPPORT IS DEFINED BY THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND THE
INFORMATION INVOLVED. IN PRACTICE, LINGUISTIC SUPPORT HAS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF
NOT ONLY THE SUBJECT CONTENT BUT ALSO A RANGE OF EXTERNAL FEATURES INCLUDING
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION. ITS APPLICATION IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS CAN BE SEEN
AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IN UNISIST, AS WELL AS AT NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL.
THE UZBEKISTAN BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES AND REVIEWS.

THE BIBLIOGRAPHY, PUBLISHED SINCE 1976 BY THE NATIONAL PUBLISHERS OF THE
UZBEKISTAN SSR IN TASHKENT, LISTS ARTICLES FROM UZBEKISTAN NEWSPAPERS
PUBLISHED IN UZBEKISH, RUSSIAN, TADZHIKISH AND KARAKALPAKISH. THE WORK APPEARS
MONTHLY AND EVERY 3 MONTHS ALSO LISTS REVIEWS FROM UZBEKISH NEWSPAPERS AND
PERIODICALS. THE 1976 AND 1977 EDITIONS EACH LISTED OVER 7,000 ARTICLES. MAIN
ENTRIES ARE ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE CLASSIFICATION SCHEME OF THE SOVIET
NATIONAL LIBRARY, WHOSE 31 MAIN CLASSES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL AND SOVIET
CATALOGUING RULES ARE USED. THERE ARE ALSO INDEXES OF PERSONAL AND
GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES. TRANSLITERATION PROBLEMS INVOLVING THE 4 LANGUAGES ARE
DESCRIBED.
BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX' 1THE USER'S PROBLEMS.A

 SUBJECT SEARCH WAS MADE IN 2BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX 1(JANUARY-JUNE 1981) FOR
INFORMATION ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS. EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF EASTERN EUROPE, THE
TEACHING OF CHILDREN FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES, THE EDUCATION OF MATURE STUDENTS,
AND REMEDIAL EDUCATION. IN EACH CASE VERY LITTLE MATERIAL WAS TRACEABLE BY
LOOKING UNDER THE MORE OBVIOUS HEADINGS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE WHEN
THE SEARCH WAS COMPLETE. ONLY A COVER-TO-COVER READING OF BEI COULD RETRIEVE
ALL THE RELEVANT ARTICLES WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY. ALTHOUGH MUCH MATERIAL
WAS IN BEI, THE USE OF PRECIS CONSTITUTED A BARRIER IN EVERY CASE AND MADE
RETRIEVAL DIFFICULT.
CONSULTING SERVICE AT THE LIBRARY OF TIANJIN UNIVERSITY.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE LITERATURE SEARCHING AND CONSULTING GROUP OF THE LIBRARY
OF TIANJIN UNIVERSITY, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. IDENTIFIES CATEGORIES OF
INQUIRY AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS BENEFITTED THE
UNIVERSITY, SAVING TIME FOR RESEARCHERS AND SPEEDING UP THE DEVELOPMENT OF
RESEARCH.
USER AND LIBRARIAN IN CONVERSATION, PT. 2.

WHEN CONTINUING OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE OF READERS' ADVISORY WORK CARRIED OUT
BY STAFF IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LIBRARIES, IT WAS NOTED THAT SOME CATALOGUING
MEDIA ARE KEPT FOR STAFF USE ONLY; INSTRUCTION ON THE USE OF OTHERS IS
PROVIDED FOR THE PUBLIC. THE USE OF CATALOGUES AND REFERENCE WORKS FOR SUBJECT
AND TITLE REQUESTS WAS ANALYSED, REVEALING CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS IN THE USE
OF DIFFERENT MEDIA BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THE DICTIONARY CATALOGUE WAS THE
CATALOGUE TYPE MOST WIDELY USED AND SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR SUBJECT AND
KEYWORD REQUESTS ARE DESCRIBED. THE INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THE NECESSITY OF
EXPANDING LIBRARIANS' SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE AND OF ENCOURAGING FLEXIBLE REACTIONS
BY STAFF TO CONTINUALLY CHANGING SITUATIONS. FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING
ABSTRACT.
USER AND LIBRARIAN IN CONVERSATION, PT. 1.

AN INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT INTO THE BEHAVIOUR OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS
WHEN HANDLING READERS' ENQUIRIES IN THE ADULT LENDING DEPARTMENT OF
NEUBRANDENBERG MUNICIPAL AND DISTRICT LIBRARY, WITH THE INTENTION OF ASSESSING
THE USER-STAFF RELATIONSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION. CHECKS
WERE MADE ON THE FREQUENCY OF USERS' VISITS DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE
DAY TO SEE WHETHER THE LIBRARIAN HAD SUFFICIENT TIME FOR ADVISORY WORK, WHICH
WAS IN FACT THE CASE FOR ABOUT 80% OF THE TIME. IT IS DIFFICULT BUT NECESSARY
TO MAKE A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS TYPE OF WORK IN ORDER TO MAKE A
COMPARISON OF RESULTS.
A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE SERVICE TO READERS AS PART OF READING GUIDANCE.

SETS OUT TO DESCRIBE THE EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE
WORK, MAKING CLEAR THOSE FEATURES WHICH, BY WAY OF THEIR ACTIVE PROMOTION OF
INFORMATION, DISTINGUISH IT FROM A PURELY PASSIVE QUESTION AND ANSWER FORM OF
SERVICE. THE ROLE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE WORK IN THE WHOLE FIELD OF
READING GUIDANCE IS SO IMPORTANT THAT RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE UNDERTAKEN INTO NOT
ONLY ITS ORGANISATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS, BUT ALSO ITS CONTENT. ONLY
WHEN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL METHODS ARE EMPLOYED IN ALL PROCESSES OF LIBRARY WORK
WILL A HIGHER LEVEL OF BOOK PROMOTION BE ACHIEVED.
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF UAP.

THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION IS VITAL FOR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. INFORMATION IS AT PRESENT AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
LARGELY CONTAINED IN PUBLICATIONS. A NUMBER OF FACTORS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO AN
INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR PUBLICATIONS, BUT MANY NEDCS REMAIN UNMET. THE
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES BY PUBLISHERS, THE BOOK TRADE,
LIBRARIES AND OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION SERVICE REQUIRES INTELLECTUAL AND
FINANCIAL COMMITMENT, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PLANNING BASED ON VALID AND
RELIABLE DATA, COORDINATION AND COOPERATION, AND WILL REQUIRE ACTION BY
GOVERNMENTS, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS.
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON THE UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS (UAP).

OUTLINES THE UAP PROGRAMME AND THE PLACE THEREIN OF THE UAP CONGRESS. SETS OUT
THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE FOR THE CONGRESS ON THE
PROGRAMME AND ON A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE QUESTION OF COPYRIGHT.
LITERATURE INFORMATION AND UAP. THE PRACTICE IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
BULGARIA.

SINCE THE MID 70S THE TERM UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS) HAS
BEEN CURRENT IN LIBRARY WORK. LIBRARIANS HAVE DEVELOPED THE PROCESS OF MAKING
PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE UNIVERSALLY ALONG VARIOUS LINES. IN BULGARIA THE
CONCEPT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP WITH MUCH INTEREST AND DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. UAP IS
TO DEVELOP ON 3 LEVELS' NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL. THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY IN SOFIA HAS DEVELOPED A CATALOGUE SYSTEM WHICH PRESENTS A CURRENT
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RECORD OF ALL NATIONAL PUBLICATIONS-THIS BULGARIAN NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY IS PUBLISHED IN 8 SERIES. IT ENABLES THE NATIONAL LIBRARY TO
SUPPLY LITERATURE ON BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE AVAILABILITY
OF FOREIGN LITERATURE IS IMPROVED BY LITERATURE INFORMATION SOURCES SUCH AS,
2THE CENTRAL CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS1 AND 2THE BULLETIN OF FOREIGN
MONOGRAPHS1 BOTH OF WHICH ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN COMPUTERISED FORM.
UAP AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

DESCRIBES THE STATUS OF UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS) IN THE 5
ASEAN (ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS) COUNTRIES AND HOW IT COULD BE
DEVELOPED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AS A 1ST STEP. TAKING THE ASEAN
COUNTRIES-INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE AND THAILAND-AS
REPRESENTATIVE OF CONDITIONS PREVAILING IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
CONSIDERS THE QUESTION OF LITERACY AND RELATED FACTORS WITHIN THE REGION.
GHANA AND UAP' OBSTACLES AND PROSPECTS.

SINCE INDEPENDENCE, GHANA'S BOOK INDUSTRY HAS RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE STATE TO DEVELOP A VIABLE MODERN INDIGENOUS
INFRASTRUCTURE. ITS PROGRESS HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC AND
OTHER FACTORS. LOW LITERACY IS SLOWING DOWN THE SPREAD OF THE BOOK CULTURE,
AND COMBINED WITH OBSTRUCTIVE INDIFFERENCE OF OFFICIALS, ACCESS TO AND
AVAILABILITY OF INDIGENOUS PUBLICATIONS ARE PROVING DIFFICULT. LIBRARIES ARE
FACING ENORMOUS OBSTACLES IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. ACTION
AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS IS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE
PROMOTION OF UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS).
SOME THOUGHTS IN THE FORM OF A DIARY.

PRESENTS PERSONAL VIEWS ON RECENT PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES. WITH REFERENCE TO A
STUDY DAY ON 'SHOCKING BOOKS', CRITICISES THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION CHOSEN,
A QUESTIONNAIRE ON 25 SELECTED TITLES DISTRIBUTED TO LIBRARIANS, AS AMBIGUOUS,
AND PROPOSES INSTEAD THAT USER RESPONSES TO A LESS RESTRICTED SELECTION OF
BOOKS BE INVESTIGATED. SECONDLY DISCUSSES THE PLACE OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO A STUDY DAY ON THIS THEME, ARGUING THAT THE
LIBRARY'S PRIORITY IS TO PROVIDE SATISFACTORY DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION
SERVICES; OTHER ACTIVITIES ARE ONLY OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE, AND SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED AS PUBLICITY STRATEGIES RATHER THAN ACTUAL USER SERVICES.
LIBRARY CLOUT IN LOCAL CABLE.

DESCRIBES THE PARTICIPATION BY MUNROE COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY, BLOOMINGTON,
INDIANA IN PROVIDING COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING ON THE LOCAL CABLE TV SYSTEM. SINCE
1975 COMMUNITY ACCESS CHANNEL THREE HAS BEEN CABLECASTING 64-68 HOURS PER WEEK
FEATURING LIVE COVERAGE OF COUNCIL MEETINGS AND PUBLIC FORUMS, ARTS
PERFORMANCES, DOCUMENTARIES ON PUBLIC ISSUES AND PROGRAMMES FOR SCHOOLS. IN
FUTURE OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS WILL BE INVOLVED MORE DIRECTLY IN PROVIDING
FUNDS AND PROGRAMMES.
MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF PROCESSING COSTS IN ACADEMIC ARCHIVES.

THE TIMELY PROCESSING OF NEW ACQUISITIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL
MANAGEMENT OF ACADEMIC ARCHIVES AND MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS. GREATER CONTROL OF
THESE ACTIVITIES MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF
PROCESSING COSTS. PROPOSES 2 PROCEDURES FOR COSTS STUDIES AND DESCRIBES THE
RESULTS OF SUCH STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN.
CONCLUDES WITH A DESCRIPTION OF PROCESSING EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENTS AND
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE APPLICATIONS OF STUDY FINDINGS TO PROGRAMME OPERATIONS.
COMPUTERISATION OF LIBRARY TECHNIQUES IN THE PETAH TIKVA MUNICIPAL LIBRARY.

THE PETAH TIKVA CENTRAL MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WAS 1 OF THE 1ST PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
ISRAEL TO INTRODUCE THE COMPUTER FOR CIRCULATION CONTROL AND OTHER LIBRARY
TECHNIQUES. DESCRIBES THE MANUAL CHARGING SYSTEM FORMERLY IN USE AND COMPARES
IT TO THE CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTRODUCTION OF
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING BY USE OF BAR-CODE LABELS, LIGHT PENS AND AN IBM
3741 DATA STATION. THE LIBRARY HOPES TO EXTEND EDP TO ITS 20 BRANCH LIBRARIES
AND EXPAND THE USE OF THE COMPUTER TO OTHER LIBRARY PROCESSES.
LEAVING LOLA FOR WLN.

DESCRIBES THE CONVERSION BY WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FROM THEIR OWN
LIBRARY ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEM (LOLA) TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND
ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK. PROVIDES STATISTICS
ON THE CONVERSION AND DISCUSSES THE CONVERSION OF ACCOUNTING AND VENDOR DATA
TOGETHER WITH THE TESTING AND FINAL CONVERSION IN 1978.
THE CARE AND FEEDING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA.

EDITED VERSION OF THE PAPER PREPARED AS A RESULT OF THE US LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
NETWORK ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING ON THE OWNERSHIP AND DISTRIBUTION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA, SPRING 80. IT IS A WORKING DOCUMENT, DESIGNED TO ELICIT
COMMENTS FROM THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES ON THE LEGAL, POLITICAL,
AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF EXCHANGING AND SHARING BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM AMONG A WIDE RANGE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ORGANISATIONS.
ISSUES RAISED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE LISTED IN 3
CATEGORIES-OWNERSHIP/DISTRIBUTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA, RELATIONSHIPS AMONG
MEMBERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMUNITY, AND INTERNATIONAL FLOW OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA. INITIAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN.
FROM THE NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY, TOKYO. 2. A PROPOSAL FOR A STANDARD COMMON
CORE CHARACTER SET (CCCS).

SHORTENED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE SECTION ON INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY, IFLA MANILA CONFERENCE, 1980. TO ATTAIN THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL, AN EAST ASIAN VERSION OF UNIMARC MUST BE DEVELOPED;
EACH COUNTRY USING CHINESE CHARACTERS MUST FORMULATE A STANDARDISED CHINESE
CHARACTER SET; AND CONVERSION TABLES MUST BE DEVISED TO ENABLE SUCH COUNTRIES
TO EXCHANGE MARC TAPES WITH MEANINGFUL RESULTS. A COMMON CORE CHARACTER SET
(COMPRISING CHINESE CHARACTERS HAVING THE SAME MEANING IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES)
COULD BE COMPILED. JAPAN'S NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY IS WILLING TO WORK ON THIS.
FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 82/5413.
ISBNS AND THEIR USE.

THE BASICS OF USING INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBERS IN LIBRARY COMPUTERS
ARE DESCRIBED.
THE NORTHWESTERN AFRICANA PROJECT' AN EXPERIMENT IN DECENTRALIZED
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND AUTHORITY CONTROL.

THE NORTHWESTERN AFRICANA PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A SYSTEM OF
DECENTRALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIC-CONTROL CENTRES COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR
BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE, CONSISTENT NATIONAL DATA BASE FOR USE IN A NATIONAL
LIBRARY NETWORK. UTILISING FUNDING GRANTED BY THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE
HUMANITIES AND BY THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, ILLINOIS,
SOUGHT TO SHOW THAT A HIGH-QUALITY DATA BASE, THAT IS, ONE THAT CONFORMS TO
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOGUING STANDARDS AND HEADING USAGE, COULD BE PREPARED
AND MAINTAINED AT A LOCATION REMOTE FROM LC. THE DATA BASE WOULD BE
TRANSMITTED TO A CENTRAL LOCATION FOR INCORPORATION INTO A COMMON DATA BASE
AND FOR DISTRIBUTION.
AN INTERNATIONAL MARC NETWORK.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARC NETWORK STUDY'STEERING
COMMITTEE OF THE CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES, WHICH IS
AFFILIATED WITH IFLA. THE COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED WITH THE PRIMARY SOURCE
RECORDS CREATED BY NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC AGENCIES AND WITH THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE DISSEMINATION OF THESE, SO THAT UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF COSTLY
RECORD CREATION CAN BE AVOIDED AND SO THAT RECORDS OF NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE. DISCUSSES THE WELLS REPORT
WHICH EXAMINED THE EXISTING MARC NETWORK SITUATION AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON
ITS BIBLIOGRAPHIC, MACHINE AND MANAGEMENT ASPECTS, AND WORK OF THE COMMITTEE
ON INTERNATIONAL MARC EXCHANGES AND THE STRUCTURE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MARC
NETWORK. DESCRIBES THE CONCEPT OF AN INTERNATIONAL MARC OFFICE TO PROMOTE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL MARC NETWORK.
SERIALS CONTROL: IS THERE A NEED FOR CHANGE?.

SERIALS CONTROL ALWAYS THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION, CONTINUES TO
SPARK CONTROVERSY. HOW AND WHY CHANGES IN THE CONTROL OF SERIALS ARE PLANNED
AND IMPLEMENTED ARE OF GROWING CONCERN TO LIBRARIANS, AS WELL AS THE NEED TO
ASSESS THE IMPACT THE CHANGES HAVE ON THE ORGANISATION AND STRUCTURE OF
LIBRARIES.
SERIALS PUBLISHING' A WORLD OF VARIATION.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP
WORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14 JUNE 80. EXPLAINS THE COMPLEX WORKING
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLISHERS AND LIBRARIES. STARTING DATE, EXPIRATION DATE,
CANCELLATION, PAYMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF SERIALS ARE ANALYSED AS WELL AS
NEW TITLES, DISCONTINUED TITLES AND FULFILMENT CENTRES. NOTES PROBLEMS AND
SUGGESTS IMPROVEMENTS.
SERIALS MANAGEMENT IN THE '80S.

SPECIAL SECTION DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP WORKSHOP, 14 JUNE 80, VANCOUVER, B.C.
FOR ABSTRACTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL PAPERS 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
FORM OR FUNCTION? AN ANALYSIS OF THE SERIALS DEPARTMENT IN THE MODERN ACADEMIC
LIBRARY.

EXPLORES HOW SEPARATE SERIALS PROCEDURES FROM THE REST OF THE STOCK PROCESSING
DEVELOPED IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND WHETHER TODAY THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE
PROCEDURES IS POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE. CONCLUDES THAT THE ORGANISATION OF
PROCEDURES BY FUNCTION AND THE GROWING USE OF AUTOMATION CAN RESULT IN MORE
EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND BETTER SERVICE AND MAY ALSO LEAD TO THE DISSOLUTION
OF TECHNICAL SERVICES AS THEY ARE KNOWN TODAY AND TO A NEW DEFINITION OF
LIBRARY WORK WHEREBY WORK IS ORGANISED BY SUBJECT AND/OR SERVICE AND BY
FUNCTION WITHIN A SUBJECT, NOT BY FORMAT.
A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO SERIALS DATA CONVERSION.

LOOKS AT SOME OF THE STAGES IN PLANNING THE CONVERSION FROM MANUAL PERIODICALS
PROCESSING TO ON-LINE SYSTEMS. COVERS SUCH AREAS AS' ANALYSIS OF CURRENT FILES
AND PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS, SELECTION OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM,
MACHINE-READABLE FILES AND RECORD STRUCTURE, CONVERSION PROJECT STAFF AND
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION.
MANUAL VS AUTOMATED CHECK-IN' A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TWO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

THE COMPARATIVE COSTS OF MANUAL AND COMPUTERISED PROCESSING OF PERIODICALS
WERE DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE MANUAL SYSTEM AT IOWA STATE LIBRARY AND THE
OCLC SERIALS CONTROL SUBSYSTEM AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIDAS.

DESCRIBES THE ON-LINE SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM LIBRARY INFORMATION ON THE
DISTRIBUTION OF ALL SERIALS (LIDAS) DEVELOPED FOR THE CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
LIBRARY OF THE UK CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE SYSTEM
ARE' THAT SERIALS ARE CHECKED IN QUICKLY AND EASILY ON THE TERMINAL, PRODUCING
DISTRIBUTION LABELS AND CIRCULATION LISTS, SHELF MARKS FOR COPIES FOR THE
LIBRARY AND ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION THE CLERICAL STAFF NEED TO BE AWARE OF
WHEN RECEIVING ISSUES OF PARTICULAR SERIALS; THAT A NUMBER OF STANDARD REPORTS
BE READILY AVAILABLE; THAT OVERDUE AND MISSING ISSUES BE AUTOMATICALLY SPOTTED
AND REPORTED ON; THAT AD-HOC ENQUIRIES CAN BE QUICKLY ANSWERED BY ACCESSING
THE DATA BASE AND GENERATING ONE-OFF REPORTS; THAT IT REPLACES KARDEX AND
OTHER MANUAL SYSTEMS; THAT IT IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CAN BE MAINTAINED BY
LIBRARY STAFF; THAT IT IS EASY TO USE; AND THAT IT REMAINS FLEXIBLE.
THE BEST BOOKS FOR THE LIBRARIES. THE SEARCH FOR RESERVES IS VITAL.

300 REPLIES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE ON ACQUISITIONING IN BIBLIOTEKAR' (MOSCOW) (1)
1981 WERE RECEIVED: 200 FROM MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, 100 FROM RURAL ONES. 54% OF
LIBRARIES MENTIONED LIBRARY SUPPLIERS' UNSATISFACTORY MANAGEMENT OF
ALLOCATIONS; 90% MENTIONED POOR FULFILLMENT OF ORDERS. LIBRARY SUPPLIERS'
GREATEST DEFICIENCIES WERE IN SUPPLYING FICTION AND CHILDREN'S LITERATURE,
FOLLOWED BY HISTORY, TECHNOLOGY, ART, AGRICULTURE, MEDICINE, NATURAL HISTORY,
POPULAR SCIENCE, SPORT, LITERATURE, ETHICS AND LAW, EDUCATION, DOMESTIC
SCIENCE. LIBRARIES IN NEW TOWNS HAVE ACUTE ACQUISITIONING PROBLEMS. SCHOOL
LIBRARIES SHOULD ACQUISITION CENTRALLY THROUGH LIBRARY SUPPLIERS.
CORRESPONDENTS SUGGESTED MORE BOOKS OUGHT TO BE SENT TO THE LIBRARY NETWORK.
BOOK-DISTRIBUTION MUST BE STRICTLY CONTROLLED, PAYMENT OF BOOKSELLERS' WORK
BEING DEPENDENT ON SATISFACTORY FULFILLMENT OF LIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS PLANS.
STATE DEPOSITORY CLEARINGHOUSE MEETING, DECEMBER 1980.

REPORT OF THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF STATE LIBRARIES-SPONSORED CONFERENCE FOR
STATE PUBLICATIONS CLEARINGHOUSE LIBRARIANS, DENVER, 3-5 DEC 80. THE
CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF STATE
PUBLICATIONS AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION; ITS THEME WAS HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN
ACQUIRING PUBLICATIONS FROM STATE AGENCIES AND GETTING THEM TO THE DEPOSITORY
LIBRARIES. DELEGATES DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN THEIR STATES AND DISCUSSED
MANUAL AND ON-LINE CHECKLISTS AND INDEXES, NAME AUTHORITY FILES, AND USE OF
MICROFICHE.
MANAGING AND BUILDING A COLLECTION OF RUSSIAN AND SOVIET NEWSPAPERS.

A REVIEW OF SOVIET PERIODICALS IS FOLLOWED BY A LARGE SECTION DEVOTED TO
SELECTION TOOLS AND TRANSLATION SERVICES AS AIDS TO PERIODICALS ACQUISITION.
THE ROLE OF SUBSCRIPTION AGENTS.

OUTLINES THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE REPORT 2THE ROLE OF SUBSCRIPTION
AGENTS1, BY ALAN SINGLETON (UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER, PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS
RESEARCH CENTRE). THE STUDY FOCUSED ON THE PART PLAYED BY AGENTS IN THE
PURCHASE OF SCHOLARLY JOURNALS FROM PUBLISHERS AND ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY THE
LEVEL OF AGENT PROFIT MARGINS; BENEFITS TO PUBLISHER AND CUSTOMER (USUALLY AN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY); DRAWBACKS; HOW LIBRARIES SELECT AND EVALUATE AGENTS; AND
THE NUMBER, TYPE, AND SIZE OF AGENTS IN THE UK AND THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS.
THE ACQUISITION OF SOUTH ASIAN MATERIALS.

ABRIDGEMENT OF A PAPER GIVEN AT THE SALG CONFERENCE ON THE ACQUISITION OF
BOOKS FROM SOUTH ASIA, LONDON, MAY 80. REASONS FOR DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING
PERIODICALS FROM SOUTH ASIA ARE ROOTED IN SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF LIBRARIANS. DESCRIBES' THE ENVIRONMENT IN
WHICH SOUTH ASIAN SERIAL PUBLISHING TAKES PLACE; BIBLIOGRAPHICAL TOOLS;
OBTAINING REGULAR SUPPLIES THROUGH INTERNATIONAL SERIALS AGENTS, LOCAL
BOOKSELLERS, DIRECT SUBSCRIPTIONS FROM PUBLISHERS AND EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS.
THE 'CLASSICS' WILL CIRCULATE.

DESCRIBES EFFORTS BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AT DARIEN (CONNECTICUT) TO PROMOTE THE
READING OF CLASSICS. LOOKS AT BUILDING UP THE COLLECTION, PROBLEMS OF
OBTAINING NEW COPIES IN HARDBACK AND PATRON RESPONSE. LISTS THE TITLES BROUGHT
WITH THE 1ST $2000.
SOME FEATURES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH LIBRARY BOOK STOCKS WITHIN A
REGION.

OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID GROWTH BOTH IN THE NUMBERS OF
LIBRARIES AND IN THE SIZE OF THEIR STOCKS. BELORUSSIA PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS AND ITS STATISTICS CAN BE FAVOURABLY COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE USSR AS A
WHOLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LIBRARIES INTO COOPERATIVE NETWORKS NECESSITATED
SPECIALISATION IN BOOK SELECTION, BUT THERE WAS FOUND TO BE LITTLE VALUE IN
SMALL LIBRARIES SPECIALISING WHILE ALL THE LARGER ONES MAINTAINED UNIVERSAL
STOCKS. VARIOUS METHODS OF PROFILING WERE USED TO AVOID THIS.
NEW DIRECTIONS IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.

AFTER A BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO PRESENT PROBLEMS IN COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE RISING COST AND INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF SERIALS,
ASSESSES FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. POLICIES WILL BECOME MORE SERVICE-ORIENTATED AND
THERE WILL BE MORE RELIANCE ON RESOURCE SHARING AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER
LIBRARIES TOGETHER WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS AND
ACQUISITION OF A WIDER VARIETY OF FORMATS FOR MATERIALS.
GIVE 'EM WHAT THEY WANT!.

DISCUSSES BOOK SELECTION BY THE BALTIMORE COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
(MARYLAND), WHICH AIMS TO MATCH ITS COLLECTIONS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF ITS
USERS. DESCRIBES THE USE OF CIRCULATION STATISTICS FOR WEEDING COLLECTIONS AND
BUILDING THEM UP IN AREAS OF HIGH INTEREST. 20% OF THE BUDGET IS SPENT ON
MATERIALS.
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN COURT.

A SUMMARY OF SOME US COURT CASES INVOLVING MATERIALS IN SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
CENTRES WHICH HAVE SET PRECEDENTS. THESE CASES OFFER 3 GUIDELINES FOR MEDIA
SPECIALISTS' THEY NEED TO KNOW THE EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF THEIR SCHOOLS AND
COMMUNITIES; WHEN SELECTING MATERIALS THAT MIGHT INVITE CHALLENGES, LIBRARIANS
NEED TO SEE THAT THE MATERIALS ARE KEYED TO SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES;
AND THESE CASES RE-EMPHASISE THE NEED FOR SCHOOL BOARDS TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT
PROCEDURES FOR THE HANDLING OF COMPLAINTS CONCERNING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS.
TOOLS OF THE SERIALS TRADE.

A REGULAR FEATURE OF 2SERIALS REVIEW1 DEVOTED TO MONOGRAPHIC AND SERIAL
PUBLICATIONS ABOUT SERIALS. COVERS ACQUISITIONS, CATALOGUING, BINDING,
STORAGE, MICROFORMS, AUTOMATION, NETWORKS, INTERLOANS AND ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF
SERIALS LIBRARIANSHIP.
SELF-CENSORSHIP IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT BY HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
SPECIALISTS.

STUDY OF THE PRACTICE OF SELF-CENSORSHIP BY LIBRARIANS IN US SECONDARY SCHOOL
LIBRARY MEDIA CENTRES. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO 718 LIBRARIANS AND 478
USABLE RETURNS WERE COLLECTED. LIBRARIANS SEEM, IN THEIR SELECTION, TO AVOID
CONTROVERSIAL TITLES; THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ABSENCE OF CONTROVERSIAL
TITLES FROM THE LIBRARIANS' COLLECTIONS WAS NOT UNIFORMLY A SIGNAL FOR THE
ORDERING OF TITLES; AND THE PRESENCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF RESTRICTED ACCESS
MATERIALS AGAIN INDICATES LIBRARIANS' RELUCTANCE TO FACE CENSORSHIP BATTLES.
SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY (I).

SINCE THE 1970S THE PUBLIC HAVE MADE GREAT USE OF THE SOUND CASSETTES PROVIDED
IN LIBRARIES, WHICH HAS ENCOURAGED LIBRARIANS TO INCREASE STOCKS. LIBRARIANS
ARE USED TO COPING WITH THE RELATIVELY WELL ORGANISED BOOK MARKET, WHERE LISTS
AND REVIEWS OF NEW PUBLICATIONS ARE EASILY OBTAINED AND CRITERIA FOR
EVALUATING THEM WELL ESTABLISHED. THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOUND CASSETTE MARKET
IS UNFAMILIAR TO LIBRARIANS. FEW LARGE FIRMS PRODUCE CASSETTES REGULARLY;
SMALL NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUAL TAPES ARE OFTEN PRODUCED, WHICH DISAPPEAR BEFORE
THEY CAN BE LISTED AND REVIEWED. THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION'S LIBRARY CENTRE
REVIEWS NEW TAPES TO HELP LIBRARIANS SELECT STOCKS. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING
TAPES ARE NOT YET FIRMLY ESTABLISHED; ASSESSMENT SHOULD COVER THE TECHNICAL
QUALITY OF THE RECORDING AND THE STANDARD OF THE MATERIAL RECORDED.
SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY (III)' LANGUAGE COURSES AND CASSETTES.

LIBRARIANS ARE OFTEN UNCERTAIN OF THE RIGHT CHOICES IN A LARGE MARKET. A BROAD
OUTLINE IS GIVEN OF CASSETTE MATERIAL AVAILABLE IN GERMANY FOR' SHORT COURSES
FOR TOURISTS, WITH NOTES AND CASSETTES; COURSES OFFERING MORE DETAILED
TEXTBOOKS WITH COMPLEMENTARY CASSETTES; AND COMPLETE LANGUAGE COURSES WITH
TEXTBOOKS, GRAMMAR, DICTIONARIES, EXERCISES, CASSETTES AND NOTES FOR TEACHERS.
POSSIBLE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION ARE' THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COURSE CONTENT
IS ADAPTED TO ADULT NEEDS; THE SUITABILITY OF THE COURSE'S DIDACTIC
CONSTRUCTION TO THOSE NEEDS, ESPECIALLY THE USE OF REALISTIC SITUATIONS AND
BACKGROUND INFORMATION; THE TOPICALITY OF VOCABULARY, IDIOM AND GRAMMAR; AND
THE ACOUSTIC QUALITY, WHICH SHOULD USE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS AND NATURAL SPEECH
RHYTHM AND MELODY, WITH PAUSES FOR STUDENTS TO REPEAT WORDS AND PHRASES. (FOR
PARTS I AND II, 2SEE1 82/5287 AND 82/5291).
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA SELECTION POLICY.

OUTLINES THE DIRECTIONS IN WHICH THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA'S
COLLECTIONS ARE TO BE DEVELOPED TO FULFIL ITS DUTIES AS LAID DOWN BY THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY ACT (1960). AS WELL AS A POLICY SUMMARY AND GUIDELINES FOR
ACQUISITIONS OF BOOK AND AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS, INCLUDES A HISTORY OF THE
LIBRARY'S COLLECTIONS BY C.A. BURMESTER.
SCIENCE BOOKS ARE BETTER THAN EVER' BUT ARE LIBRARIANS KEEPING UP WITH CHANGES
IN THE FIELD?.

DISCUSSES IMPROVEMENTS IN US SCIENCE BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND
HOW LIBRARIANS CAN KEEP ABREAST OF THOSE OF A HIGH STANDARD AND WELL-REGARDED
BY EDUCATORS.
SOUND CASSETTES IN THE LIBRARY (II).

ROCK AND POP MUSIC ARE NOT JUST SOMETHING FOR TEENAGERS; THEY HAVE BECOME THE
SUBJECT OF DETAILED ARTICLES IN PROMINENT PERIODICALS AND A PERMANENT FEATURE
OF THE CULTURAL SCENE. ADVICE IS GIVEN FOR THE LIBRARIAN ON' ENCYCLOPAEDIAS,
RECORD GUIDES AND BOOKS ON THE HISTORY OF POP MUSIC; PERIODICALS AND
NEWSPAPERS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE MUSIC TRADE; BASIC STOCK LISTS FOR
RECORDS AND TAPES; AND RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTS. COVERAGE IS MAINLY OF
GERMAN MATERIAL. POSSIBLE CRITERIA FOR MATERIAL SELECTION ARE' TECHNICAL
QUALITY OF RECORDS OR TAPES; MUSICAL INTERPRETATION, COMPOSITION AND
ORIGINALITY; THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PERFORMER OR BAND; THE TARGET GROUP OF THE
RECORDING; AND TOPICALITY. (FOR PART I, 2SEE1 82/5287).
AIDS TO LIBRARIES IN THE PURCHASE OF MEDICAL PERIODICALS.

10 BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF MEDICAL PERIODICALS ARE DESCRIBED, NOT ALL SUITABLE FOR
GERMAN MEDICAL LIBRARIES. A METHOD WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE CITATION FREQUENCY
OF PERIODICALS FOR FINDING OUT THE BASIC IMPORTANT PERIODICALS. A COMPARISON
WAS MADE BETWEEN REQUESTS FOR PERIODICALS FROM ULM AND COLOGNE AND A LIST OF
AN INTERNATIONAL RANGE OF PUBLICATIONS MADE. THE NEW LIST IS CONSIDERED TO BE
AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO A MEDICAL LIBRARY'S BASIC NEEDS; ALL EXCEPT THE
SMALLEST HOSPITAL LIBRARIES WOULD REQUIRE LARGER STOCKS. THE NUMBER OF CURRENT
PERIODICALS TAKEN BY A LIBRARY SHOULD DEPEND ON' THE NUMBER OF READERS AND
REQUESTS; AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PERIODICALS.
BOOK SELECTION PRESSURE ON SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA SPECIALISTS AND TEACHERS.

REPORT ON A STUDY CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF WARNING SYMBOLS USED
IN CONNECTION WITH BOOK REVIEWS ON THE SELECTION PROCESS. ONE FINDING
INDICATES THAT A BOOK REVIEW WARNING SYMBOL SYSTEM EXERTS A NEGATIVE
CHOICE-AVOIDANCE INFLUENCE UPON ADULT BOOK SELECTORS WHEN CHOOSING CHILDREN'S
BOOKS. RESULTS REINFORCE THE NEED OF BOOK SELECTORS TO READ MORE THAN ONE
SELECTION AID WHEN CHOOSING BOOKS.
BOOKSELLERS-IS THERE A CHOICE?.

GIVES ADVICE TO TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH PUBLISHERS AND
BOOKSELLERS IN ORDER TO GET THE BEST SERVICE. SUGGEST CRITERIA FOR SELECTING
BOOKSELLERS AND MENTIONS HELPFUL SERVICES OFFERED BY BOOKSELLERS IN THE
MELBOURNE AREA.
COPING WITH THE CUTS.

THE RECENT FALL OF THE POUND AGAINST THE DOLLAR HAS AGGRAVATED THE SAVAGE
DECLINE IN UK POLYTECHNIC AND UNIVERSITY INCOME AS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF
PERIODICALS ARE OF NORTH AMERICAN ORIGIN. CRITICISES THE TRESS BRAUN INDEX SET
UP BY THE UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION TO MONITOR PRICE INCREASES. SUGGESTS
THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES FOR LIBRARIANS' NEVER SEPARATE PERIODICAL COMMITMENT
FROM MONOGRAPH SPENDING; NEVER RUN A DEFICIT; AND ALWAYS KNOW WHAT NEXT YEAR'S
BUDGET WILL BE; AND BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR UNEXPECTED PRICE RISES. LOOKS AT THE
GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF 2 MODEL CASE STUDIES. LIBRARIANS SHOULD COMPARE PRICES
OF MATERIALS THROUGH DIFFERENT AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS TO GET THE BEST DEAL.
THE FOUNDATION SECTION OF THE GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION.

INFORMATION IS GIVEN FROM REPORTS PUBLISHED SINCE 1976 ON THE GERMAN RESEARCH
ASSOCIATION FOUNDATION SECTION'S ROLE AS PROVIDER OF MONEY FOR THE PURCHASE OF
COMPLETE SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND POSTHUMOUS WORKS. 46 SUCH COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN
PURCHASED TO DATE AND DISTRIBUTED TO VARIOUS LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
IN 1980 PURCHASES INCLUDED SOME POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF LUDWIG BINSWANGER FOR THE
BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY OF THE MUSIC HISTORIAN FRIEDRICH GENNRICH
FOR FRANKFURT MUNICIPAL LIBRARY AND A COLLECTION ON GERMAN POLITICAL HISTORY
FOR THE KONRAD ADENAUER FOUNDATION. THE SECTION HAS ALSO ASSISTED A WORKING
PARTY OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITIES IN THE
PURCHASE OF SIMILAR COLLECTIONS.
THE RISE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF MONOGRAPHS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE SURVEY COVERS ONLY PRICES OF MONOGRAPHS IN EAST GERMANY. THE RANGE AND
CRITERIA FOR THE RANDOM SAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO THE PURCHASING POLICY OF A
LIBRARY AT THE 2ND LEVEL ACCORDING TO 2BIBLIOTHEKSPLAN '731, (2LIBRARY PLAN
19731). THE STATISTICS SHOW DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1975-79 IN AMOUNTS SPENT AND
PROPORTIONS OF A TOTAL BUDGET. FROM THESE FIGURES IT CAN BE SEEN THAT 840,000
DM WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR MONOGRAPH PURCHASE IN 1980, A BUDGET ONLY
EXCEEDED BY 17 LIBRARIES AT THIS LEVEL. PRICE RISES VARIED ACCORDING TO TYPE
OF MATERIAL BUT SHOWED RELATIVE STABILITY WHERE LIBRARY SELECTION WAS
CONCERNED. FROM THESE FIGURES THE AVERAGE EXPENDITURE REQUIRED FOR 1982 CAN BE
CALCULATED.
AUTOMATED STANDING ORDER SYSTEM, BLACKWELL NORTH AMERICA.

THE COMPUTERISED STANDING ORDER SYSTEM, DEVELOPED BY RICHARD ABEL & CO. AND
BOUGHT BY BLACKWELL NORTH AMERICA, IS DESCRIBED. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED DURING
THE CONVERSION FROM THE MANUAL TO AUTOMATED SYSTEM ARE DESCRIBED, TOGETHER
WITH DETAILS OF THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO
POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT RELATING TO 'LIBRARY MATERIALS' IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW
MEDIA ACT.

THE AUSTRIAN LAW OF LEGAL DEPOSIT WAS DUE FOR REFORM, PARTLY TO BRING UP TO
DATE THE PRICE LIMITS FOR BOOKS DEPOSITED, AND PARTLY TO EXTEND THE SCOPE TO
INCLUDE MULTI-MEDIA CATEGORIES. THE NEW ACT, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN JUNE 81,
IS CRITICISED FOR ITS EXCLUSION OF NON-BOOK MATERIALS (ESPECIALLY FILMS) IN
SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE AUSTRIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATION,
SINCE JULY 81, TO MAINTAIN MULTI-MEDIA ARCHIVES. THERE IS ALSO CRITICISM OF
THE INCLUSION OF PARLIAMENT AS A DEPOSIT LIBRARY, OF THE EXTENDED CATEGORIES
OF EXEMPTION AND OF THE DECISION TO ALLOW PUBLISHERS 1 MONTH IN WHICH TO
DEPOSIT INSTEAD OF 8 DAYS AS PREVIOUSLY.
DORMANT EXCHANGES SUPPORTED BY A SYSTEM OF TOKENS; A SUGGESTION.

THE TERM 'DORMANT EXCHANGE' DESCRIBES AN EXCHANGE SYSTEM IN WHICH 1 LIBRARY
NEEDS AND OBTAINS AN ITEM AT A GIVEN TIME FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY BUT NOT VICE
VERSA. AN EXCHANGE IS STILL MADE, HOWEVER, BUT ON A CREDIT SYSTEM SO THAT THE
OTHER LIBRARY CAN REQUEST DESIRED MATERIAL AT A LATER DATE WHEN THE NEED
ARISES, THUS ELIMINATING WASTEFUL EXCHANGES. THE OPERATION COULD BE GREATLY
SIMPLIFIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONALLY VALID EXCHANGE TOKEN
ENABLING A RECIPIENT LIBRARY TO PAY FOR EXCHANGE MATERIAL AND A PROVIDING
LIBRARY TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR WHAT IS SUPPLIED. IT IS CONCEDED THAT VALUATION
OF TOKENS COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.
SOME ACQUISITION PROBLEMS IN BULGARIA.

THE SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR ACQUISITION COORDINATION, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT
TO FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS, HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE
THAN 20 YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, SEVERAL NATIONAL VENUES HAVE TAKEN PLACE
UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE COMMISSION TO KEEP LIBRARIANS ABREAST OF THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS. 1 OF THE LATEST SEMINARS DEALT WITH COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS AFTER THE
WIDE INTRODUCTION OF MODERN REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE HAS
BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN MAJOR BULGARIAN LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE CYRIL AND
METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY AND THE
UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA LIBRARY. EXCHANGE IS THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE THE DEPLETIVE
EFFECT OF THE RAPIDLY GROWING PRICES OF WESTERN PERIODICALS AND BOOKS ON THE
FOREIGN CURRENCY ALLOWANCES AVAILABLE TO BULGARIAN LIBRARIES. THE COMMISSION'S
FOREMOST TASK IS TO REMOVE OBSTACLES A ND TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER POSITIVE STEPS
IN THIS IMPORTANT SECTION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES.
NDL'S INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES WITH SOME EMPHASIS ON PROBLEMS
RELATING TO SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SOUTH ASIA.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE MEETING OF THE SECTION ON EXCHANGE AND ACQUISITION AT
THE 46TH IFLA CONFERENCE, MANILA, 18-23 AUG 80. PRESENTS A PICTURE OF THE
JAPANESE NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY'S INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OPERATION'S COVERING
EXCHANGES OF OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS, OTHER SELECTIVE EXCHANGE PROGRAMMES AND
THE FREE TRANSMISSION SERVICE FOR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. EMPHASISES THE NECESSITY
OF STRENGTHENING EXCHANGES WITH SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBOURS IN THE
LIGHT OF RELATIVELY WEAK EXCHANGE RELATIONS WITH THAT REGION.
THE NEED FOR IMPROVED WORLDWIDE PROVISION OF PUBLICATIONS.

NATIONAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY INTERNATIONAL
AVAILABILITY. THE BEST EVIDENCE FOR THE NEED FOR BETTER INTERNATIONAL
PROVISION IS SUPPLIED BY DATA ON INTERNATIONAL LENDING. THE VOLUME OF
INTERNATIONAL LENDING AND PHOTOCOPYING IS ABOUT 1 MILLION ITEMS A YEAR AND IS
GROWING RAPIDLY. SATISFACTION RATES AND SUPPLY TIMES BOTH NEED IMPROVEMENT.
ABOUT 2/3 OF DEMAND IS FOR JOURNALS, AND IS CONCENTRATED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF
CENTRES, WHICH GIVE A MUCH BETTER THAN AVERAGE SERVICE. SPEED OF SUPPLY
APPEARS TO BE UNRELATED TO DISTANCE. POSSIBLE PATTERNS OF PROVISION FOR THE
FUTURE INCLUDE ACCESS TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL IMPRINTS, REGIONAL
SYSTEMS, AND LARGE NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES IN COUNTRIES WITH HEAVY
INTERLENDING DEMAND.
INTERNATIONAL INTERLENDING SERVICES IN FINLAND.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 4TH FINNISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF INTERLIBRARY
LOANS IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, HELD
23-24 APR 79. AFTER AN OUTLINE OF THE COVERAGE OF FINNISH PUBLICATIONS BY
BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND LIBRARY CATALOGUES (NOW MOSTLY AVAILABLE IN A MICROFORM
FORMAT) PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION WITH REGARD TO FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS
CONCENTRATING MAINLY ON THE PROVISION OF UNION CATALOGUES. INTERNATIONAL
LIBRARY LOANS ARE A FAST GROWING LIBRARY SERVICE IN FINLAND. MAJOR PARTNERS OF
FINNISH LIBRARIES ARE SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARIES, THE LENDING DIVISION OF THE
BRITISH LIBRARY AND SEVERAL LARGE SOVIET LIBRARIES. FIGURES ARE GIVEN OF LOANS
FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS. CONCLUDES WITH A THOUGHT ON THE ROLE OF AUTOMATION IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY LOANS IN FUTURE.
THE INTERLIBRARY LOANS SYSTEM IN FINLAND.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 4TH FINNISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF INTERLIBRARY
LOANS IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, HELD
23-24 APR 79. INTERLIBRARY LENDING SYSTEM IN FINLAND COMPRISES A NETWORK OF
RESEARCH LIBRARIES AS WELL AS SOME 50% OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. REGIONAL LIBRARIES
HAVE THE ROLE OF INTERLENDING CENTRES; THE HELSINKI CITY LIBRARY HAS THE
FUNCTION OF THE NATIONAL CENTRE. ORGANISATION OF THE SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED.
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NOT, SO FAR, ANY FIXED PROCEDURES THE REGIONAL CENTRES ACT
AS INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES. IN ITS ROLE
OF THE FINNISH BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTRE THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
PUBLISHES THE UNION CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS. THE LIBRARY HAS THE
FULLEST COLLECTION, OUTSIDE THE USSR, OF RUSSIAN 1820-1917 IMPRINTS DUE TO ITS
LEGAL DEPOSIT RIGHTS TO RUSSIAN PUBLICATIONS IN THIS PERIOD. STATISTICS ARE
GIVEN OF LOANS FROM THIS COLLECTION.
IV FINNISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE ROLE OF INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN THE PROVISION
OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY'.

SECTION DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE 4TH FINNISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE
ROLE OF INTERLIBRARY LOANS IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO SCIENCE
AND INDUSTRY, 23-24 APR 79, FOR ABSTRACTS OF WHICH +S+E+E THE FOLLOWING SERIAL
NUMBERS'.
PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING: NEAT, PLAUSIBLE, AND WRONG.

ARGUES THAT DEVELOPING NETWORKS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE USA IS NOT THE
ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OF LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. USERS PREFER TO TAKE A 2ND
CHOICE WHICH IS AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE SHELVES TO A 1ST CHOICE WHICH
HAS TO BE OBTAINED FROM ELSEWHERE AND THE 1ST THING TO BE CUT AS FUNDING FALLS
IS RESOURCE SHARING ACTIVITIES. PRESENTS STATISTICS FOR INTERLOANS IN
CALIFORNIA AND ILLINOIS TO SHOW WHAT A MINUTE % OF CIRCULATION IS ACCOUNTED
FOR BY INTERLOANS. RELYING HEAVILY ON MATERIALS NOT AVAILABLE AT ONCE IN A
LIBRARY IS AKIN TO A RETURN TO CLOSED STACKS. SUGGESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN
EQUIVALENT TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION.
COLLECTION MANAGEMENT AND SERIALS IN A CHANGING LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP
WORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14 JUNE 80. THE PROLIFERATION OF PERIODICALS AND
THEIR ESCALATING COSTS ARE OF INCREASING CONCERN TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND
WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE. PRESENTS A HISTORICAL
OVERVIEW OF THIS PHENOMENON WITH COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ON HOW COLLECTION
MANAGERS MAY COPE WITH SERIALS. MAKES PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE CANADIAN
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SCENE.
DETERMINATION OF THE CONSERVATION TIME OF PERIODICALS FOR OPTIMAL SHELF
MAINTENANCE OF A LIBRARY.

A METHOD BASED ON A CONSTRAINED OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUE IS PRESENTED TO
DETERMINE THE TIME OF REMOVAL OF SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS FROM THE SHELF OF A
LIBRARY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MINIMISING SHELF MAINTENANCE COST ON THE
CONDITION THAT THE LOSS OF THE INFORMATION IS LESS THAN SOME SPECIFIED RATE.
THE SOLUTION OBTAINED INDICATES THAT ALL THE UTILITIES OF THE PERIODICALS
SHOULD BE EQUAL AT THE REMOVAL TIME. A GEOMETRICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE
THEORETICAL RESULT IS GIVEN. A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE IS GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THIS
TECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO REAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA.
A STUDY OF WEEDING POLICIES IN 11 TALON RESOURCE LIBRARIES.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY OF THE WEEDING POLICIES OF 11 TALON (TEXAS,
ARKANSAS, LOUISIANA, OKLAHOMA AND NEW MEXICO) RESOURCE LIBRARIES. THESE
RESULTS INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH WEEDING WAS PERFORMED BY MOST OF THE
LIBRARIES, FEW HAD A WRITTEN POLICY CONCERNING IT. DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF
WEEDING DONE BY LIBRARIES, AND THE REASONS FOR IT. INCLUDES DISCUSSION OF THE
PREVALENT MEANS OF DISPOSITION OF WITHDRAWN MATERIALS, AND OF THE OBSTACLES TO
COOPERATIVE WEEDING.
THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS' THE LEGAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
DEALING WITH THEFT FROM THE COLLECTIONS AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.

EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IS WRITTEN OFF BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES
AS A RESULT OF THEFT OR DAMAGE BY LIBRARY USERS. IN THE MAASTRICHT PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS A STUDY OF THE PROBLEM MADE FROM JAN-JUNE 81 SHOWED
THAT SOME MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE LIBRARY WITHOUT REGISTERING THE
TRANSACTION, SOME WAS BORROWED ON TICKETS CONTAINING FALSE OR INCORRECT
INFORMATION, WHILE OTHERS WERE BORROWED AND NOT RETURNED, OR RETURNED IN A
DAMAGED CONDITION. WHERE PROOF OF THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY PROPERTY
EXISTS THE DUTCH CIVIL CODE ALLOWS LIBRARY AUTHORITIES TO INSTRUCT THE LOCAL
CHIEF INSPECTOR OF JUSTICE TO TAKE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GUILTY PARTY.
WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY THE JUDGE MAY ORDER COMPENSATION TO BE
MADE TO THE LIBRARY CONCERNED.
EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY.

CAMBRIDGESHIRE PUBLIC LIBRARIES, HUNGTINGDON DIVISION, HAVE DESIGNED A NEW
LABELLING SYSTEM FOR THE CATEGORISATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS. THE SYSTEM WAS
DESIGNED TO HAVE MEANING TO BOTH THE STAFF AND PUBLIC, AND COPYRIGHT FREE
DESIGNS WERE SOUGHT. EACH SIGN IS REPRINTED HERE. THEY INCLUDE A STAR-SHAPED
BADGE FOR WESTERNS, A FLOWER FOR GARDENING AND PLANTS, A TANK FOR WAR, AND A
CLOWN'S FACE FOR 'FUNNY STORIES'. THERE ARE 2 CATEGORIES OF SYMBOLS-1 FOR
ADULTS AND 1 FOR CHILDREN.
SOME PROBLEMS OF LIBRARY CONSERVATION.

THE GENERAL PROBLEMS OF BOOK CONSERVATION ARE DISCUSSED AND A LIST OF BOOKS
AND JOURNALS, USEFUL FOR LIBRARIANS CONCERNED WITH CONSERVATION, IS INCLUDED.
CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS).S

PECIAL ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS. FOR ABSTRACTS
OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARTICLES 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBERS'.
A REVIEW OF PAPER QUALITY AND PAPER CHEMISTRY.

DESCRIBES HOW ACID PAPER QUICKLY BECOMES BRITTLE AND SUFFERS WITH FOLDING.
DISCUSSES WAYS OF DEACIDIFYING PAPER AND NEW METHODS OF PRODUCING ALKALINE
PAPER WHICH SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY US PAPER-MANUFACTURERS TO A GREATER EXTENT,
FOLLOWING A EUROPEAN LEAD. TO SPEED THE CHANGE TO ALKALINE PAPER, EVERY PAPER
CONSUMER, MAGAZINE SUBSCRIBER AND LIBRARIAN MUST MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD.
CREATIVITY +V. DESPAIR' THE CHALLENGE OF PRESERVATION ADMINISTRATION.

DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE PRESERVATION ADMINISTRATOR IN US LIBRARIES AND HOW
LACK OF INFORMATION AND EXPERTISE HAS HINDERED THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF
PRESERVATION PROGRAMMES. MENTIONS 3 RESEARCH PROJECTS ON PRESERVATION.
CONSERVATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINT COLLECTIONS.

ESSENTIAL LINES OF ACTION FOR LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS IN THE
CONSCIENTIOUS CARE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL,
PROPER PREPARATION OF MATERIALS FOR HANDLING AND STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT OF
CONSERVATION RESEARCH FACILITIES. DISCUSSES PRESERVATION PROBLEMS RELATING TO
THE STRUCTURE OF THE MAJOR TYPES OF SILVER PRINTS ON PAPER' SALT, ALBUMEN,
COLLODION AND GELATIN PRINTS, TOGETHER WITH PROBLEMS OF OXIDATION AND THE
FORMATION OF SILVER SULPHIDE.
BOOK RENOVATION.

A LITTLE REPAIR KEEPS LIBRARY BOOKS 'READABLE'. STARCH PASTE, CASEIN GLUE OR
POLYVINYLACETATE GLUE IS BEST FOR BOOK REPAIRS. DAMPEN TURNED-DOWN PAGES WITH
MOIST COTTON WOOL. GLUE, CARD, PAPER, GAUZE, LEATHERETTE, CALICO, SCISSORS,
RULER, SET-SQUARE, HAMMER, BINDING-KNIFE AND PRESS ARE NECESSARY FOR
REBINDING. FOR BOOKS WITH SEWN GATHERINGS' DIVIDE GATHERINGS, RESEW, GLUE
BACKS, PLACE IN PRESS, TRIM PAGES, ROUND OFF SPINE, CUT OUT COVERS, COVER WITH
FABRIC, PRESS, LEAVE TO DRY, GLUE BINDING TO BOOK. DIVIDE UNSEWN BOOKS INTO
SEPARATE PAGES, REASSEMBLE, PRESS PAGES BETWEEN CARDBOARD AND SPREAD PVA GLUE
ON SPINE, PLACE IN PRESS, PLACE THREADS IN SLITS IN SPINE, FILL WITH GLUE,
BINDING-CASE AS ABOVE.
THE REPAIR WORKSHOP OF HAMBURG STATE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

FOUNDED IN 1960, THE WORKSHOP WAS 1ST CONCERNED MAINLY WITH BOOKBINDING; A FEW
YEARS LATER A SEPARATE SECTION WAS OPENED FOR DOCUMENT PRESERVATION AND
RESTORATION OF PAPYRI AND OTHER MANUSCRIPTS. TOTAL ESTIMATES FOR DAMAGED
MATERIAL IN THE EARLY 1960S WERE OVER 422,000 DM, A SUM WHICH AT THAT TIME
COULD NOT BE MET. THE FLOODS OF 1962 IN HAMBURG CAUSED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS.
SINCE 1978 EXTRA FINANCIAL HELP HAS COME FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION. THE
WORK IS NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY TIME-CONSUMING. THE WORKSHOP
IS INVOLVED IN EXHIBITIONS, TRAINING COURSES FOR LIBRARY STUDENTS AND NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES; A COLLECTION OF SUBJECT LITERATURE HAS ALSO
BEEN DEVELOPED.
BINDING.

DESCRIBES CONTEMPORARY METHODS OF BINDING' HAND BINDING, EDITION BINDING,
TEXTBOOK BINDING AND SINGLE BINDING. EMPHASISES DIFFERENT TYPES OF BINDING FOR
PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS' OVERSEWN, SIDESEWN, SEWN THROUGH THE FOLD,
ADHESIVE AND CLEATLACING AND THE SUITABILITY OF EACH FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF
MATERIALS AND USAGE. MENTIONS THE US LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE.
THE IN-HOUSE PROCESSING OF PAPERBACKS AND PAMPHLETS.

SIMPLE METHODS OF IN-HOUSE BINDING OF PAPERBACK BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS ARE
DESCRIBED.
THE BINDING AND PREPARATION OF PERIODICALS' ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES AND
PROCEDURES.

SHORT REVIEW OF TECHNIQUES USED TO BIND PERIODICALS IN THE LIBRARY.
DISASTER' PREVENTION, PREPAREDNESS AND ACTION.

AWARENESS STIMULATED BY WELL-PUBLICISED DISASTERS HAS RESULTED IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS PLANS AND IN BETTER TECHNIQUES FOR
COPING RESPONSIBLY IF THE WORST HAPPENS. UNDERSTANDING THE NATURAL HAZARDS OF
AN AREA, ANTICIPATING PROBLEMS AND MAINTAINING BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS TO
WITHSTAND DISASTER MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOTAL LOSS AND DAMAGE. FIRE
PREVENTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS FIRE NOT ONLY DESTROYS BOOKS BUT BRINGS
THE POSSIBILITY OF MASSIVE VOLUMES OF WATER. CONSIDERATIONS FOR PREPLANNING
INCLUDE ASSIGNING SPECIFIC TASKS, KNOWING SOURCES OF SUPPLIES, LISTS OF
RELEVANT TELEPHONE NUMBERS, ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES IN THE STOCK, DEVELOPING
PLANS FOR TREATING WATER- AND FIRE-DAMAGED MATERIALS AND INSURANCE. BRIEFLY
LOOKS AT ACTION TO BE TAKEN IF DISASTER STRIKES AND OUTLINES SOME US
INITIATIVES.
BOOK THEFTS FROM UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AS A LEGAL PROBLEM.

THE THEFT OF BOOKS FROM LARGE, OPEN-PLAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IS A MANY-SIDED
PROBLEM. IT HAS REACHED SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT IT IS COSTING UNIVERSITIES IN
WEST GERMANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DM EVERY YEAR AND SPECIAL DETECTOR SYSTEMS
HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN SOME LIBRARIES. THESE HAVE LED TO MANY WOULD-BE THEFTS
BEING PREVENTED AND CHARGES BEING BROUGHT FOR THEFT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF
THESE CHARGES HAVE HAD TO BE DROPPED OWING TO LOOPHOLES IN LAWS APPLICABLE TO
BOOK THEFTS. GERMAN CRIMINAL LAW STIPULATES THAT THE INTENTION OF KEEPING AN
OBJECT MUST BE PRESENT TO CONSTITUTE A THEFT; THIS IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
PROVE IN THE CASE OF BOOK THEFTS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO FAILS TO
PROVIDE ADEQUATE PENALTIES AND VARIES FROM ONE STATE TO THE NEXT. IT IS
NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE THEFT OF BOOKS AS AN OFFENCE IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW,
PUNISHABLE BY A FINE THROUGHOUT WEST GERMANY.
ON-LINE LENDING REGISTRATION. A PILOT PROJECT OF THE STATE OF
BADEN-WURTTEMBERG.

IN 1975 A RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE IN THE BADEN-WURTTEMBERG LIBRARY PLANS TO
INTRODUCE COMPUTERISED LENDING SYSTEMS IN ALL UNIVERSITY AND STATE LIBRARIES.
A PILOT PROJECT TO TEST THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM WAS STARTED IN
FREIBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN OCT 77. THE AUTOMATION PROGRESSED IN 3 PHASES'
THE FICTION AND TEXT BOOK COLLECTION; THE PUBLIC BOOK COLLECTION; THE
STOCKROOM COLLECTION. A DIETZ STANDARD COMPUTER SYSTEM WITH ADAPTATIONS FOR A
LENDING SYSTEM WAS USED. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE AUTOMATED PROCESS IN THE 1ST
2 STAGES OF THE PLAN WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND LED TO PREPARATIONS BEING MADE
FOR OTHER LIBRARIES IN TUBINGEN AND KARLSRUHE TO ADOPT THE SYSTEM. THE 3RD
PHASE WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE BEGINNING OF 1982. THE COMPUTERISED LENDING
SYSTEM LED TO AN INCREASE IN LENDING FROM 350,000 IN 1975 TO 700,000 IN 1980
WHICH REFLECTS A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE LIBRARY USER SERVICE.
UNIVERSITY FACULTIES AND LIBRARY LENDING CODES' A SURVEY AND ANALYSIS.

PRESENTS RESULTS OF SURVEY OF 98 MEMBERS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ASSOCATION OF
RESEARCH LIBRARIES TO SEE IF FACULTY MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES FOR THE
OVERDUE MATERIALS. 71 LIBRARIES HAD SOME FORM OF PENALTY FOR REGULAR
CIRCULATING MATERIALS AND 74 FOR THE NON-RETURN OF RECALLED MATERIALS. STATE
SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONS TENDED TOWARDS PUNITIVE MEASURES, WHILE PRIVATELY
SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONS DID NOT.
COPYRIGHT AND PHOTOCOPYING IN THE UK' FEW HINTS OF LIBRARIAN/PUBLISHER
COMPROMISE.

REPORT OF THE DEBATE ON COPYRIGHT DURING THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE,
1981. THE LIBRARIANS' AND PUBLISHERS' VIEWPOINTS WERE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED,
BUT THE OVERALL FEELING WAS THAT THEIR DIFFERENT PRIORITIES PRECLUDED A
CONSENSUS-ALTHOUGH BOTH SIDES ATTACKED THE RECENT GOVERNMENT GREEN PAPER
(DISCUSSION DOCUMENT) ON THE SUBJECT.
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF USER COSTS IN A SAMPLE OF CENTRES FOR ACCESS TO PRIMARY
DOCUMENTS.

DESCRIBES 9 PRINCIPAL CENTRES, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL USED BY THE BELGIUM
DOCUMENTATION SERVICE, GIVING DETAILS OF PRICES AND CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT.
COMPARISON IS BY GRAPH AND TABLE. THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS
SPEED OF DELIVERY AND METHOD OF PAYMENT IN INFLUENCING USER CHOICE IS
EMPHASISED.
CATALOGING AND CLASSIFICATION PRACTICES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIBRARIES.

RESULTS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY SENT TO A SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE
LIBRARIES IN THE US INDICATE THAT AS THESE LIBRARIES ENTER THE 1980S THEIR
COLLECTIONS ARE STILL TRADITIONALLY ORGANISED. ALTHOUGH AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS
ARE NOW CATALOGUED AND CLASSIFIED, THERE IS LITTLE AGREEMENT AS TO HOW THEY
SHOULD BE ORGANISED; AND MOST AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS ARE STILL HOUSED IN
CLOSED-ACCESS AREAS. CHANGE TO AACR 2 SEEMS TO BE ACCEPTED, BUT LIBRARIANS ARE
STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING NETWORKS.
PROCESSING FOR THE YOUNG LIBRARY USER.

OFFERS ADVICE TO NIGERIAN LIBRARIANS ON THE CATALOGUING, CLASSIFICATION, AND
PHYSICAL PROCESSING OF BOOKS SO AS TO MAKE THEM EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE YOUNG
LIBRARY USER. RECOMMENDS THE COMPILATION OF A DICTIONARY CATALOGUE, AND THE
USE OF A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.
DISCUSSES THE TYPE AND NUMBER OF CATALOGUE ENTRIES REQUIRED, AND GIVES AN
EXAMPLE OF SUCH AN ENTRY. STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CAREFUL LABELING OF
BOOKS AND THE CORRECT FILING OF CATALOGUE CARDS. RECOMMENDS THE USE OF FILING
RULES SUCH AS THOSE LAID DOWN IN 2COMMON SENSE CATALOGUING1 BY ESTHER J.
PIERCY.
THE DESCRIPTION OF CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS.

A SYSTEMATIC PRESENTATION OF THE METHODS USED AT A FRENCH REGIONAL ARCHIVE.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS AS COMPARED TO MEDIAEVAL
DOCUMENTS ARE DISCUSSED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF STANDARD PROCEDURES EFFECTED ON
RECEIPT OF RECORDS FOR DEPOSIT' THE ELEMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE INITIAL
IDENTIFICATION ANALYSIS ARE OUTLINED; CLASSIFICATION OPERATIONS ILLUSTRATED IN
RELATION TO THE CATALOGUES AND INDEXES MAINTAINED; AND FINALLY ELIMINATION
PRACTICES DESCRIBED. THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING ADEQUATE TOOLS FOR FUTURE
RESEARCH IS EMPHASISED, ALTHOUGH THE ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS INVOLVED ARE
TIME-CONSUMING. DOCUMENTARY MATERIAL ILLUSTRATING ALL STAGES OF THE RECORD
ANALYSIS IS APPENDED.
ELECTRONICS AND CATALOGUING, TWENTY YEARS LATER.

IN 1961, C.D. GULL WROTE 2 PAPERS ON THE IMPACT OF ELECTRONICS ON CATALOGUING.
REFLECTS ON THESE PAPERS IN RELATION TO ACTUAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 20 YEARS
SINCE THEN.
HOW TO PREPARE ARCHIVE TRANSFER LISTS.

A REPORT BY A MEMBER OF THE WORKING PARTY OF ARCHIVISTS AND DOCUMENTALISTS
FROM THE FRENCH NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND ITS INTERMEDIARY REPOSITORY AT
FONTAINEBLEAU, INSTITUTED TO HARMONISE THE METHODS USED TO PREPARE TRANSFER
LISTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PAPERS INTENDED FOR INTERIM DEPOSIT AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL PRODUCED IS PRESENTED IN FULL' SECTION (1) COVERS THE
COMPOSITION OF THE INTRODUCTORY NOTE, WITH DETAILS OF ITS SCOPE AND A LIST OF
THE HEADINGS TO BE USED; (2) DEALS WITH PRESENTATION OF IDENTITY NUMBERS; (3)
CONSISTS OF DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS FOR PRESENTATION OF CONTENTS ANALYSIS; AND
(4) PROVIDES INSTRUCTIONS COVERING GENERAL POINTS OF STYLE AND USAGE.
INNOCENT PLEASURES' ISBD (CM), AACR2, AND MAP CATALOGUING.

OUTLINES THE BACKGROUND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION FOR CARTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS (ISBD (CM)), WHICH IS
INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED FRAMEWORK FOR SHARING
DESCRIPTIONS. PRESENTS A DETAILED ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF THE ISBD (CM) AND
THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES, AND DISCUSSES THEIR IMPACT ON MAP
CATALOGUING.
REPORT OF A CONFERENCE HELD IN COPENHAGEN NOVEMBER 18TH-20TH, 1980.

PROCEEDINGS OF A CONFERENCE OF THE ROUND TABLE OF NATIONAL CENTRES FOR LIBRARY
SERVICES WORKING GROUP DATA BASE RUN BY THE BIBLIOTHEKSCENTRALEN, COPENHAGEN,
DENMARK, 18-20 NOV 80. PAPERS INCLUDED' A PERSONAL VIEW ON THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN NATIONAL DATA BASES AND THE INTERNATIONAL DATA NETWORKS BY RICHARD
COWARD; THE USE OF MARC TAPES BY NATIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES BY KAREN LUNDE
CHRISTENSEN; PROBLEMS OF COORDINATING DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION CODES IN 1 DATA
BASE BY ROB KOOYMANN; AUTHORITY CONTROL BY EIGIL BALLING; 1 DATA BASE-AND A
VARIETY OF OUTPUT BY OLE HOVMAN; AND COST BENEFIT-A SWEDISH APPROACH TO
EVALUATION BY SVANTE HALLGREN.
THE ONCE AND FUTURE CATALOG' THE COMPUTER CATALOG AND AACR 2.

DESCRIBES THE ADVANTAGES OF ADOPTING A COMPUTERISED CATALOGUE AND ENUMERATES
THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF SUCH CATALOGUES. DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF AACR 2 AND THE STRUCTURE AND INTENT OF THE CODE, GIVING
SPECIAL ATTENTION TO CHAPTER 22 ON THE FORM OF AUTHORS' NAMES. INCLUDES
WORKSHEETS FOR PRACTICE.
IN-HOUSE PROCEDURES IN A LIBRARY USING CODOC.

THE SEVERAL POSSIBLE METHODS FOR EMPLOYING THE CODOC COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING
SYSTEM IN AN INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY ARE REVIEWED, AND THE POINT IS MADE THAT THE
SYSTEM INCORPORATES CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY, AND COSTS CAN VARY GREATLY
ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES CHOSEN. SAMPLE COSTS FOR 1 SET OF OPTIONS ARE
DISCUSSED, AND THE BENEFITS OF THE SYSTEM TO THE LIBRARY, IN BOTH ECONOMIC AND
INTANGIBLE TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED.
A READER'S VIEW OF EAST ASIAN CATALOGUE AUTOMATION.

DISCUSSES WHETHER AUTOMATION IS PREFERABLE FOR CATALOGUES OF CHINESE LANGUAGE
MATERIALS IN AUSTRALIA. PRESENTS A BRIEF HISTORY OF CATALOGUING AND
CLASSIFICATION IN CHINA. THE ROMANISED CATALOGUE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER IS MOST
SUITED TO AUTOMATION BUT A SUPPLEMENTARY CHARACTER-BASED CATALOGUE FOR LARGE
EAST ASIAN HOLDINGS WOULD HELP USERS MORE FAMILIAR WITH CHARACTERS AND WITH
DIFFERENT PRONUNCIATIONS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS. SUGGESTS THAT
LIBRARIANS SHOULD HOLD BACK AUTOMATION UNTIL AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WHICH CAN
COPE WITH BOTH ROMANISED AND CHARACTER DATA AT A REASONABLE COST IS DEVELOPED
AND THEN AIM FOR A CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR ALL EAST ASIAN MATERIALS
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, POSSIBLY BASED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA BUT
WITH INPUT FROM ALL LIBRARIES WITH EAST ASIAN MATERIALS.
SERIALS CATALOGUING' UTLAS AND THE MACHINE ENVIRONMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
BRITISH COLUMBIA.

SOME WORKING EXPERIENCES OF PERIODICALS CATALOGUING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF
TORONTO LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS (UTLAS) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH
COLUMBIA, ARE DESCRIBED.
A COMPUTERIZED CATALOGUING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR HEALTH SCIENCE AUDIOVISUALS.

DESCRIBES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANFORD PUBLIC INFORMATION AND RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM (SPIRES) BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MEDICAL SCHOOL LEARNING RESOURCE
CENTER. SPIRES IS A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH OFFERS
ON-LINE SEARCH CAPABILITIES AND RETRIEVAL OF DATA IN PROGRAMMABLE FORMATS. THE
LEARNING RESOURCE CENTER UTILISES SPIRES FOR THE INTERACTIVE RETRIEVAL OF
CATALOGUING DATA, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL COMPILATIONS, AND BOOK CATALOGUE PRODUCTION.
FROM TELECAT/UNICAT TO RIBLIN OR THE TRANSMODIFICATION OF A NETWORK.

AN ACCOUNT OF HOW THE NEW CANADIAN LIBRARY NETWORK RIBLIN DEVELOPED FROM THE
DISBANDED TELECAT/UNICAT COOPERATIVE, MAINTAINING CONTINUITY OF SERVICE TO
MEMBERS BY USING THE SAME BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITY, UTLAS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF
THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL GROUP, AND SERVICES PROVIDED.
THE EXPANDED SERVICES OFFERED BY THE NEW NETWORK ARE OUTLINED TO SHOW ITS
SUPERIORITY IN CATERING MORE EFFICIENTLY FOR A COMPARATIVELY RESTRICTED GROUP
OF USERS. THE DISSOLUTION OF TELECAT/UNICAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY
OF PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES FOR A WIDELY HETEROGENEOUS USER GROUP.
THE CONCEPTION AND BIRTH PANGS OF OCLC-AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRUGGLES OF THE
FORMATIVE YEARS.

IN 1951 A SMALL GROUP OF HEAD LIBRARIANS FROM 1 MUNICIPAL AND SEVERAL PRIVATE
COLLEGES GOT TOGETHER TO COOPERATE AMONG THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THEIR RESOURCES
AND SERVICES. THEY WERE SOON JOINED BY OTHERS, INCLUDING THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN
THE LARGEST STATE-ASSISTED AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN OHIO. IT REQUIRED THE
STRENUOUS, OFTEN AGONIZING EFFORTS OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AND COLLEGE
PRESIDENTS, WORKING THROUGH THE OHIO LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE OHIO COLLEGE
ASSOCIATION, TO CONCEIVE AND DELIVER THE OHIO COLLEGE LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC
INC.) IN 1967.
THE ISBDS AND CHINESE CATALOGUING, AND THEIR APPLICATION IN HONG KONG
LIBRARIES.

UPDATED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED TO THE SECTION ON CATALOGUING, IFLA
CONFERENCE, MANILA, AUG 80; CONTRIBUTION TO THE ISBD 5-YEAR REVIEW; AND
CONTRIBUTION TO A PROJECT ON PROBLEMS OF APPLYING ISBDS TO NON-ROMAN SCRIPT
PUBLICATIONS (SUPPORTED BY UNESCO CONTRACT; FINAL REPORT SUBMITTED FEB 81).
MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE ISBD FORMAT TO ENABLE ITS USE
FOR CHINESE SCRIPTS AND OUTLINES PROCEDURES ADOPTED IN THE APPLICATION OF
ISBDS IN CHINESE CATALOGUING IN HONG KONG LIBRARIES.
CONSER AND OCLC.

DESCRIBES THE CONSER PROJECT, THE OCLC ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE AND THE WAY IN
WHICH CONSER PARTICIPANTS EDIT THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IN RECORDS IN THE
OCLC DATA BASE. 2 BASIC ELEMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE CONSER PROJECT'
AUTHENTICATION OF SERIALS RECORDED BY AGENCIES AND EDITING OF SERIAL RECORDS
BY CONSER PARTICIPANTS.
OCLC'S ROLE IN THE CONSER PROJECT.

THE CONSER PROJECT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL ON LIBRARY RESOURCES, INC.,
TO DEVELOP A HIGH QUALITY DATA BASE OF SERIAL CATALOGUING INFORMATION. OCLC
HOSTS THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROJECT. THE OCLC ON-LINE UNION CATALOG IS THE RESULT OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE CONSER PROJECT.
A QUEUEING STUDY OF PUBLIC CATALOG USE.

DISCUSSES A 6-WEEK QUEUING STUDY OF PUBLIC CATALOGUES IN THE IOWA STATE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SYSTEM. DATA GATHERED ARE ANALYSED PRIMARILY TO DETERMINE
IF ROUTINELY GATHERED LIBRARY STATISTICS CAN VALIDLY BE USED TO PREDICT
CATALOGUE USAGE, TO DISCOVER THE RATIO BETWEEN THE USAGE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE
AND THE SENATE CATALOGUE, AND TO PINPOINT THE TIME OF PEAK CARD CATALOGUE
USAGE IN ORDER TO MEASURE MORE CLOSELY THE RATE OF USE. THIS MEASUREMENT,
THEN, CAN PROVIDE 1 FACTOR IN A SIMULATION MODEL THAT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED TO
PREDICT ACCURATELY THE NUMBER OF DEVICES NEEDED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CATALOGUE
FORMAT.
SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION AND DISPLAY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC APPARATUS' THE SYSTEM USED
BY ULM UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN CATALOGUES FOR MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS, FOR THE
LAST 2 YEARS ULM UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS MAINTAINED A SPECIAL CARD CATALOGUE
FOR REFERENCE STOCK, INCLUDING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS AND
ARRANGED IN 3 SECTIONS' AN ALPHABETICAL AUTHOR/TITLE CATALOGUE; A KEYWORD
CATALOGUE; AND A CLASSIFIED LOCATION CATALOGUE. ULM HAVE DEVISED THEIR OWN
SYSTEM, DESCRIBED IN DETAIL, FOR DETERMINING KEYWORD GROUPS AND NOTATION
STRUCTURE. ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIAL CATALOGUE ARE' IT LISTS MONOGRAPHS AND
PERIODICALS TOGETHER; PERIODICALS ARE GIVEN A SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION; THE
NOTATION IS EASIER TO REMEMBER THAN THAT USED IN THE MAIN CATALOGUE; THE
KEYWORDS ARE IN GERMAN; THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT PRODUCED BY USING THE NOTATION
IS SUITED TO THE STOCK.
PUBLIC TERMINAL USE IN AN ONLINE CATALOG: SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS.

A STUDY OF THE TRANSACTION COUNTS FOR 2 1/2 YEARS' ACTIVITY AT THE PUBLIC USE
TERMINALS OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' PROTOTYPE ON-LINE CARD
CATALOGUE TO DETERMINE WHAT SEARCH OPTIONS ACADEMIC LIBRARY PATRONS USE THE
MOST OFTEN AND WHETHER THIS PATTERN VARIES FROM THAT REPORTED IN MAJOR
CATALOGUE USE STUDIES. THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES IN SEARCH STRATEGY THAT MAY RESULT FROM A UNIQUE USER GROUP THAT
PREFERS TO SEARCH THE ON-LINE CATALOGUE, MORE USEFUL SEARCHES IN THE ON-LINE
SYSTEM, OR SPECIAL SEARCH PATTERNS IMPOSED BY THE COMPUTER HARDWARE ITSELF.
BOTH THE DIFFERENT SEARCHES USED BY PATRONS AND WHY THEY CHOSE THEM SHOULD BE
IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE DESIGN OF FUTURE ON-LINE CATALOGUES.
USER REACTIONS TO ONLINE CATALOGS' AN EXPLORATORY STUDY.

USE OF 4 PUBLIC ACCESS ON-LINE CATALOGUES WAS OBSERVED IN NORTH AMERICAN
HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES. SUCCESS-FAILURE RATES WERE COMPARED AND USER
OPINIONS ANALYSED. RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT IN ALL SYSTEMS' USER REACTION WAS
OVERWHELMINGLY FAVOURABLE COMPARED TO MANUAL CATALOGUES, AND IMPROVED SUBJECT
ACCESS WAS CONSIDERED THE GREATEST NEED. SEVERAL COMMON PROBLEMS EMERGED IN
THE DISPLAY AND ACCESS SYSTEMS.
THE COM MICROCATALOGUE FOR THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO.

DISCUSSES PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CONVERSION FROM CARD CATALOGUES TO A
MICROCATALOGUE SYSTEM AS THE PRIMARY ACCESS TOOL AT THE LIBRARIES OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, CANADA. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF
THE COLLECTIONS INVOLVED, REASONS FOR EVENTUAL CHOICE OF COM, CATALOGUE
ARRANGEMENT, MICROFILM AND MICROFICHE VERSIONS, AND RELATED EQUIPMENT. IN
CONCLUSION THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM TO DATE IS EVALUATED IN RELATION TO
USER SATISFACTION, COST, AND IMPROVEMENTS ON THE PREVIOUS CARD SYSTEM.
CATALOGUING AND TRANSLITERATION OF INDIC LITERATURE.

BRIEFLY DISCUSSES PROBLEMS IN THE CATALOGUING OF NAMES IN INDIAN LANGUAGE
MATERIALS AND SUGGESTS HOW TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY. LISTS ELEMENTS WHICH MAY
AND MAY NOT BE USED AS ENTRY ELEMENTS. TRANSLITERATION IS USED SO THAT STAFF
CAN HANDLE THESE LANGUAGES AND FOR COMPUTERISATION.
CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP-ITS ROLE IN LIBRARY CATALOGUING.

AN EXPLORATION OF PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY JUSTIFICATION
FOR THE TREATMENT OF CORPORATE BODIES AS AUTHORS REVEALS A HISTORY OF PARTIAL
ANSWERS AND INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED ANALYSES BOTH OF CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP IN
PARTICULAR AND OF AUTHORSHIP IN GENERAL. THE REASON FOR THE FAILURES PROBABLY
RESTS IN THE FACT THAT AUTHORSHIP IS BOTH A COMPLEX PHENOMENON AND NECESSARILY
SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LIBRARY CATALOGUE THAT IT
IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. PART I DEALS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF
CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP AND PART II WITH THE NATURE OF AUTHORSHIP IN GENERAL
UNDER THE HEADINGS' AUTHORSHIP BY ORIGINATION, AUTHORSHIP BY ASSUMPTION OF
RESPONSIBILITY, CORPORATE UTTERANCES AND CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP. IN CONCLUSION
RELATES CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP TO LIBRARY CATALOGUING.
UNIQUE SERIAL TITLE ENTRIES.

AACR 2 REQUIRES A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION OF PERIODICALS TO BE ENTERED UNDER
TITLE, WHETHER OR NOT THE TITLE IS UNIQUE. THE CODE DOES NOT PROVIDE RULES FOR
THE CREATION OF UNIFORM TITLES FOR PERIODICALS. AS A RESULT, THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS DREW UP GUIDELINES FOR UNIFORM TITLES.
CLOSED CATALOGS AND SPLIT FILES' A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORM.

DISCUSSES PROBLEMS IN CONVERTING CATALOGUES TO AACR2, SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVE
METHODS OF EFFECTING THE CHANGEOVER. MANY LIBRARIES ARE CLOSING OR FREEZING
THEIR CARD CATALOGUES IN THE USA AND MOVING TO A COM, INTERIM CARD OR ON-LINE
CATALOGUE. IF ALL AACR2 CHANGES ARE NOT MADE AS THEY OCCUR SPLIT FILES ARE
INEVITABLE WHICH LEADS TO POOR PRECISION AND RECALL AS USERS ARE RELUCTANT TO
SEARCH IN MORE THAN 1 PLACE.
AACR 2: THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY!-CELEBRATION OR LAMENT.

WHEN IMPLEMENTING AACR 2 THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN DECIDED TO INTERFILE AACR
2 CATALOGUING INTO THE EXISTING CARD CATALOGUE, TO INTERFILE VARIANT NAME
FORMS WHEN THE AACR 2 FORM HAD THE SAME INITIAL ELEMENT AND TO CREATE SPLIT
FILES WHEN THE INITIAL ELEMENTS WERE DIFFERENT IN THE AACR2 FORM. DESCRIBES
THE ESTABLISHING OF AUTHORITY CONTROL.
AACR 2 AND SERIALS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP
WORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14 JUNE 80. DISCUSSES CHANGES IN THE CATALOGUING OF
PERIODICALS INTRODUCED BY AACR2 IN 3 GROUPS' THOSE THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED
IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE AACR1 AND ALA PRACTICES; THOSE OF A CONTROVERSIAL
NATURE; AND THOSE THAT ARE PRIMARILY COSMETIC. THE CHANGES ARE SEEN TO BE
GENERALLY BENEFICIAL, LEADING TO GREATER CONSISTENCY IN CATALOGUE RECORDS FOR
PERIODICALS.
RAK (RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) DISCUSSED.

THE AUTHORISED EDITION OF RAK WAS PUBLISHED IN BERLIN IN 1976 AND IN WIESBADEN
IN 1977. THIS COMPLETED ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING REFORM IN GERMANY. FROM
1976-79 MUCH LITERATURE DEALING WITH RAK WAS PUBLISHED. MANY OF THE
PUBLICATIONS WERE CONCERNED WITH ADAPTATIONS OF RAK TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF
LIBRARIES SUCH AS RAK-WB (WISSENSCHAFTLICHE BIBLIOTHEKEN) ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
OR RAK-OB (OFFENTLICHE BIBLIOTHEKEN) PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE
IN EAST GERMANY WHERE ADAPTATIONS OF RAK FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESEARCH
LIBRARIES AND UNION LIBRARIES WERE PUBLISHED. LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE
EXPLAINING IN DETAIL THE USE OF RAK IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS SUCH AS LAW,
BIBLICAL LITERATURE, ARCHIVE LITERATURE, JOURNALS, NEWSPAPERS AND CONGRESS
REPORTS. REPORTS AND DISCUSSIONS ON EXPERIENCES OF LIBRARIES IN THE
INTRODUCTION OF RAK AND THE BEST METHODS OF TRAINING STAFF MOSTLY STEM FROM
EAST GERMANY AND ARE ONLY FIRST INITIATIVES IN THIS FIELD.
THE TITLE PAGE OF A RECORD.

THE NEW RAK (RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) SECTION ON THE CATALOGUING OF
MUSICAL SCORES AND SOUND RECORDINGS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE IN PRE-PRINT FORM SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. PRACTICAL TESTING OF AND DISCUSSION ON THE SECTION
ARE ESSENTIAL TO REVEAL ANY GAPS OR AMBIGUITIES SO THAT THESE MAY BE
ELIMINATED. THE QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A TITLE PAGE WHERE A RECORD IS
CONCERNED MUST BE CONSIDERED. ACCORDING TO THE NEW RULES, THE LABEL ON THE 1ST
SIDE OF A RECORD OR RECORD SET SHOULD BE TREATED AS THE TITLE PAGE; IF THERE
IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION HERE THE RECORD COVER SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD.
EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN LABELS AND
COVERS.
LAST OF THE MONUMENTAL BOOK CATALOGS.

A HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 2NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, PRE-1956
IMPRINTS1 FROM ITS ROOTS EARLY IN THIS CENTURY TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE
FINAL, 750TH VOLUME IN 1981.
THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL SERIAL DATA SYSTEM.

THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED BY THE
DEUTSCHES BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT AND THE STATE LIBRARY IN WEST BERLIN. IT
CURRENTLY COVERS 260,000 TITLES-800,000 HOLDINGS IN 1,000 WEST GERMAN
LIBRARIES.
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SERIALS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP
WORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14 JUNE 80. IN THE EARLY 1970S 2 NATIONAL TASK
GROUPS RECOMMENDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE IN
CANADA. TO CREATE A DATA BASE LIBRARIES MUST SHARE DATA ABOUT SERIALS.
STANDARDS ARE A PRE-REQUISITE TO SHARING DATA-A STANDARD DEFINITION OF A
SERIAL, THE ISSN, THE MARC FORMAT, STANDARDS FOR HOLDINGS STATEMENTS AND
LIBRARY SYMBOLS AND CATALOGUING STANDARDS. USE OF STANDARD SOURCES OF DATA
ALSO FACILITATES SHARING. A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE NOW EXISTS IN CANADA ON
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOBIS SYSTEM JOINTLY MAINTAINED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
OF CANADA AND THE CANADA INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
DATA ON HOLDINGS OF MAJOR CANADIAN LIBRARIES ARE COLLECTED AND EDITED IN A
CENTRAL LOCATION.
BCUC AND SERIALS..

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP
WORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14 JUNE 80. PRESENTS A SHORT HISTORY OF THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH COLUMBIA UNION CATALOGUE PROJECT'S SERIALS TASK
GROUP DEC 77-JUNE 80. OUTLINES OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION IN THE CREATION OF A
PROVINCIAL UNION CATALOGUE OF SERIALS AND PRESENTS SOME POSSIBLE METHODS OF
OVERCOMING THESE OBSTACLES.
ANSI Z39.42 AND OCLC' OCLC'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD
INSTITUTE'S SERIAL HOLDINGS STATEMENTS AT THE SUMMARY LEVEL.

DESCRIBES THE ADOPTION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE'S STANDARD,
FOR DESCRIBING SERIALS HOLDINGS AT THE SUMMARY LEVEL, BY ONLINE COMPUTER
LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC). THIS FORMS PART OF OCLC'S POTENTIAL TO BECOME A
NATIONWIDE UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS.
THE ANSI STANDARD FOR SUMMARY HOLDINGS STATEMENTS FOR SERIALS' THE RLIN
IMPLEMENTATION.

DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE'S
STANDARD FOR SERIAL HOLDINGS STATEMENTS (ANSI Z39.42) TO RLIN (RESEARCH
LIBRARIES INFORMATION NETWORK).
THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.

TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL COMPUTERISED UNION CATALOGUES OF
PERIODICALS IN WEST GERMANY. THE TREND TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL
UNION CATALOGUE, THE NATIONAL SERIALS DATA SYSTEM, WHEREBY THE REGIONAL
SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED TO A NATIONAL DATA BASE IN WEST BERLIN IS DESCRIBED.
AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOG OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUALS' A
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.

THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF
MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS USING EXISTING MACHINE READABLE RECORDS
OF PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES CREATED IN A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS. THE RESULTANT FILE
WILL BE SEARCHABLE BY AUTHOR, TITLE, SUBJECT AND KEYWORD, AND WILL FACILITATE
RESOURCE-SHARING BY EXPEDITING THE PROVISION OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUAL
MATERIALS WITHIN A 6-STATE REGION OF THE USA; IT WILL FURTHER PROVIDE VALUABLE
STATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR COORDINATING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT. 1 IMPORTANT
ASPECT IS THE EXPEDITING OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS, BY AUTOMATIC
GENERATION AND THE STORAGE IN MASSAGE FILES FOR THE HOLDING LIBRARY, WITHOUT
THE REKEYBOARDING OF DATA.
A WONDERFUL TOY.

THE DANISH TECHNICAL LIBRARY AT THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY SET UP A DATA
BASE IN 1968 CONTAINING LOCATIONS OF THE LIBRARY'S OWN HOLDINGS. AT THE END OF
THE 70S THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM OF LOCATING ALSO OTHER
LIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS AND CONNECTED TO SCANNET AND EURONET. DESCRIBES A NEW
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM, CALLED ALIS (AUTOMATED LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM),
INITIATED IN NOV 81. IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO REQUISITION TITLES THROUGH THE ALIS
CATALOGUES. THESE TITLES WILL BE THOSE READILY AVAILABLE, AS THE LIBRARY'S
LOANS WILL BE REGISTERED IN THE TERMINAL FROM 1982. USE OF ALIS IS FREE. THE
SYSTEM, DESCRIBED DIAGRAMMATICALLY, CONSISTS OF A LOCAL SYSTEM FOR
ADMINISTRATION OF LOANS, AND THE I/S DATACENTRALEN'S FREE TEXT STANDARD SEARCH
SYSTEM.
SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN PLANNING FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION AT THE STATE LEVEL.

THE CONNECTICUT AUTOMATION COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CACC) WAS FORMED IN 1980 TO
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL GROUPS, LIBRARIES AND ORGANISATIONS ENGAGED IN
OR INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO MEET REGULARLY TO SHARE
INFORMATION AND TO BEGIN AN INFORMAL PLANNING EFFORT. DISCUSSES MAJOR ISSUES
THAT THE CACC HAS FACED WHICH HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER STATES. A STATEWIDE
ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE IS LIKELY TO CONSIST OF COMPONENTS DEVELOPED
INDEPENDENTLY BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES OR GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE
VOLUNTARILY ADOPTED GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS SUGGESTED BY THE CACC. THE ROLE
OF THE CACC IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CATALOGUES WHICH
MIGHT BECOME COMPONENTS, THE PROMOTION OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE COMPONENTS
AND THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE PROSPECT OF EVENTUAL LINKAGE AND
INTEGRATION OF THOSE COMPONENTS.
A LONG FAREWELL TO 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS.

THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUES
IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEY
THE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THIS
IS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARD
TERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHER
USE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATION
TERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORE
CLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD IS, THEREFORE, 1 STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING TERMINOLOGY WHICH HAS NO
REAL MEANING OR USE.
A MODEL FOR A WEIGHTED RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.

RECENT ARTICLES HAVE ANALYSED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH CONTINUOUS WEIGHTS OF
VARIOUS TYPES AND/OR WITH A BOOLEAN STRUCTURE FOR THE QUERIES. THEY HAVE ALSO
SUGGESTED CRITERIA WHICH SUCH SYSTEMS OUGHT TO SATISFY AND RECORD EVALUATION
MECHANISMS WHICH PARTIALLY SATISFY THESE CRITERIA. OFFERS A MORE CAREFUL
ANALYSIS, BASED ON A GENERALISATION OF THE DISCRETE WEIGHTS. ALSO LOOKS AT THE
WEIGHTS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INVOLVING THRESHOLDS, AND
GENERATES AN IMPROVED EVALUATION MECHANISM WHICH SEEMS TO FULFIL A LARGER
SUBSET OF THE DESIRED CRITERIA THAN PREVIOUS MECHANISMS. THIS NEW MECHANISM
ALLOWS THE USER TO ATTACH A 'THRESHOLD' TO THE QUERY TERM.
A COMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTED BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.

A MAJOR DEFICIENCY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS IS THEIR INABILITY TO
REPRESENT THE VARYING DEGREES TO WHICH A DOCUMENT MAY BE WRITTEN ON A SUBJECT.
IN THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET BY ANY BOOLEAN SYSTEM
GENERALISED TO HAVE A WEIGHTING CAPABILITY ARE ISOLATED. IT IS PROVEN THAT
ONLY 1 WEIGHTING RULE SATISFIES THESE CONDITIONS; THAT ASSOCIATED WITH
FUZZY-SET THEORY; AND THAT THIS WEIGHTING SCHEME SATISFIES MOST OF THE OTHER
PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AS WELL. PROBABILISTIC WEIGHTING IS
THEN INTRODUCED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND THE 2 SYSTEMS COMPARED. IN THE
LIMIT OF ZERO/1 WEIGHTS, ALL SYSTEMS CONSIDERED CONVERGE TO TRADITIONAL
BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.
THE LONGER THE NUMBER, THE SMALLER THE SPINE' OR, UP AND DOWN WITH MELVIL AND
ELSIE.

DISCUSSES THE PARADOX OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION' THE AIM OF
EXPRESSING ON SUBJECT IN DETAIL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING AN
INEXPENSIVE AND USEFUL DEVICE BY WHICH BOOKS CAN BE SHELVED AND RETRIEVED.
SUGGESTS THE USE OF 2 DIFFERENT SCHEMES (OR 2 LEVELS OF THE SAME SCHEME). THE
1ST SCHEME WOULD PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS OF REASONABLE LENGTHS TO
ARRANGE ITEMS IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS WHILST THE 2ND SCHEME (OR VARIANT OF THE
1ST) WOULD PROVIDE LONGER NUMBERS FOR DETAILED SUBJECT ACCESS AND
COMPREHENSIVE BROWSING CAPABILITY IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS. THESE SCHEMES COULD BE
APPLIED TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.
CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION' HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN
DEBATE, 1850-1950.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF UK AND US IDEAS ON SUBJECT HEADINGS AND
CLASSIFICATION FROM THE TIME OF PANIZZI'S CHALLENGE TO CLASSIFIED CATALOGUING
THROUGH THE PRACTICAL APPROACH OF CUTTER AND HULME TO THE WORK OF BLISS.
CUTTER AND HULME NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED THEIR PRACTICAL APPROACH, LEAVING THE
WAY CLEAR FOR THE THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATIONISTS SUCH AS OTLET AND RICHARDSON.
UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THEIR PRINCIPLES AND
ALSO THE BEGINNING OF A DECISIVE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT THAT CULMINATES IN THE
WORK OF BLISS. HIS GREAT VALUE IS THAT HE OFFERS AN INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVE ON
THE HISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION AND IS REASONABLY
ENCOURAGING ABOUT COLON CLASSIFICATION, THE SYSTEM THAT ENDED THE FORMATIVE
CLASSIFICATIONIST PERIOD IN ANGLO-AMERICAN THOUGHT.
CONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
CLASSIFICATION BY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE GDR.

A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE GREIFSWALD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ON 20 NOV 80 ON THE
APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION (BBK) SYSTEM
BY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY. THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TO
BRING TOGETHER MEMBERS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES WHICH HAD INTRODUCED BBK TO
DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM. AS THE GREIFSWALD
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD (19 YEARS) THEY TOOK
THE INITIATIVE IN CONVENING THE CONFERENCE. MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT LIBRARIES
GAVE TALKS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF INTRODUCING BBK. ALL THE
ADVANTAGES OF BBK SHOULD BE USED WHEN ADAPTING IT TO AN EXISTING
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF CHANGES MADE. SOME OF THE
PROBLEMS DISCUSSED WERE' ADAPTATIONS NECESSARY IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS SOCIAL
SCIENCES, MARXISM-LENINISM, BIOPHYSICS, BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR  BIOLOGY;
THE PROBLEMS OF THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BBK AND EXPERIENCES IN
RECLASSIFYING A SYSTEMATIC CATALOGUE ACCORDING TO THE BBK SYSTEM.
LIVING WITH DDC 19; NOT LIVING WITH DDC 19.

PRESENTS REACTIONS OF 2 LIBRARIANS TO RECLASSIFYING THEIR LIBRARIES ACCORDING
TO THE 19TH EDITION OF THE DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION. ELIZABETH DICKINSON
DESCRIBES HOW STOCKTON PUBLIC LIBRARY (CALIFORNIA) BEGAN THE PROCESS OF
ADAPTATION ALMOST AS SOON AS THE NEW EDITION WAS PUBLISHED AND OUTLINES THE
WORKING PRINCIPLES, PUBLIC IMPACT AND CRITIQUES AND RESPONSES WITH LESSONS
THAT HAVE BEEN LEARNED. FOR JOSEPHINE RINE AT MINNEAPOLIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE
(MINNESOTA), WITH ONLY A SMALL STAFF, RECLASSIFICATION IS AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.
THE COLON IN UDC.

IN UDC A LARGE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS ARE USED TO FORM THE COMPLEX NOTATION. MOST
OF THESE SYMBOLS HAVE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MEANINGS WHICH CAUSE PROBLEMS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE COLON, WHEN UDC IS USED IN AN AUTOMATED
INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE COLON IS CLEARLY INTENDED AS A SIGN DENOTING A
RELATIONSHIP NEEDING NO FURTHER DEFINITION BETWEEN 2 NUMBERS. THE USE OF THE
COLON WITH MORE THAN 2 UDC NUMBERS, ALTHOUGH UNOFFICIAL, HAS BECOME
WIDESPREAD; THE RANGE OF PERMITTED PERMUTATIONS IS DESCRIBED. WHERE THE COLON
MAY BE USED BETWEEN 2 NUMBERS, THE POSSIBLE REVERSIBILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP
MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PERMUTATION IS REMOVED THEN
THE COLON RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTION OF DENOTING A HIERARCHIC RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN 2 OR MORE UDC NUMBERS.
MACRO- AND MICROTHESAURI' CHANGES OCCURRING IN MESH-DERIVED THESAURI AND A
SOLUTION TO SOME RELATED SEARCH HANDICAPS.

EXPLORES CHANGES THAT CAN OCCUR DURING THE CREATION OF A DERIVATIVE THESAURUS.
A TERM TRANSLATION DICTIONARY IS PROPOSED TO AID MESH-TRAINED AND OTHER
SEARCHERS WHO WOULD BE USING THE CANCER INFORMATION THESAURUS.
QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND NON-DESCRIPTORS IN THESAURI.

ABOUT 40 THESAURI OR COLLECTIONS OF SUBJECT TERMINOLOGY EQUIVALENT TO THESAURI
WERE STUDIED WITH REGARD TO QUANTITY RATIOS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND
NON-DESCRIPTORS OR BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND A TOTAL VOCABULARY. WITH THE HELP
OF REGRESSION ANALYSIS, LINEAR CONNECTIONS WERE MADE WITH A STRONGLY
EMPHASISED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS AND THE
NON-DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE NUMBER OF NON-DESCRIPTORS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE MORE
SLOWLY THAN THAT OF THE DESCRIPTORS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PROPORTION OF
NON-DESCRIPTORS TO THE TOTAL VOCABULARY DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS
INCREASES. THE INIS THESAURUS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) IS
DESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THIS THEORY AND FOUND TO BE WELL PRODUCED.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE UNIVERSITIES IN WORLD NETWORK OF INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATION III HELD IN DUBROVNIK, MAY 20-23, 1980).S

STATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
HISTORICAL FILM DOCUMENTATION AT THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATION SERVICE.

THE COMPUTERISED FILM DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM BEING DEVELOPED FOR USE IN THE FILM
ARCHIVE OF THE RIJKIVOORLICHTINGSDIENST (RVD), THE NETHERLANDS INFORMATION
SERVICE, IS DESCRIBED. DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF THE FILM COLLECTION AND THE
DIFFICULTIES OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE VAST AMOUNTS OF IMPORTANT FILM. IBM
STAIRS WAS FOUND TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH SOME
ASPECTS, SUCH AS ALPHABETISATION AND REGISTER CONSTRUCTION, WERE TAKEN FROM
THE LITERATURE INFORMATION SYSTEM (LISA) DEVELOPED IN THE NETHERLANDS, AND THE
OUTPUT FORMATS ARE BASED ON THE ISBD (NBM) FOR NON-BOOK MATERIALS AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE.
USING MODERN LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES IN SPECIALISED
COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE USE OF INDEXING LANGUAGES BASED ON
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR SEARCHING COMPUTER FILES FOR SUBJECT REQUESTS. THE
MECHANICAL APPROACH SIMPLY EXTENDS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE; THE
COORDINATED APPROACH USES AS A SEARCH FORMAT A LIST OF CLASSIFICATION FEATURES
EACH SERVING A HEURISTIC FUNCTION; THE INTEGRAL APPROACH PROVIDES A SYNTHESIS
OF CLASSIFICATION AND WORD LANGUAGES WITHOUT THE DRAWBACKS OF THE OTHER 2, AND
OFFERS THE MOST LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES. DETAILED EXAMPLES SHOW THE OPERATION
OF EACH APPROACH.
A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUS
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 1. DESIGN.

ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE, ESPECIALLY BY END USERS,
BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY AND COMPLEXITY. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCERNED THE
CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE AS A MEANS TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO,
AND OPERATION OF, HETEROGENEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATA
BASES. THE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE REQUESTS IN A COMMON LANGUAGE. THESE
REQUESTS ARE TRANSLATED BY THE INTERFACE INTO THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS FOR
WHATEVER SYSTEM IS BEING INTERROGATED. SYSTEM RESPONSES MAY ALSO BE
TRANSFORMED BY THE INTERFACE INTO A COMMON FORM BEFORE BEING GIVEN TO THE
USERS. THUS, THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A SINGLE
'VIRTUAL' SYSTEM TO THE USER. THE INTERFACE ALSO PROVIDES INSTRUCTION AND
OTHER SEARCH AIDS FOR THE USER. PHILOSOPHY, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN
EXPERIMENTAL INTERFACE NAMED CONIT ARE DESCRIBED.
A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUS
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 2. EVALUATIONS.

THE EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR
SIMPLIFYING OPERATION OF MULTIPLE, HETEROGENEOUS ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AN EXPERIMENTAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, NAMED
CONIT, WAS BUILT AND TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WITH INEXPERIENCED END
USERS. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL USAGES SHOWED THAT USERS WERE
ABLE TO MASTER INTERFACE OPERATION SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO FIND RELEVANT DOCUMENT
REFERENCES. SUCCESS WAS ATTRIBUTED, IN PART, TO A SIMPLE COMMAND LANGUAGE,
ADEQUATE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, AND A SIMPLIFIED NATURAL LANGUAGE, KEYWORD/STEM
APPROACH TO SEARCHING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT OPERATIONAL INTERFACES OF THE TYPE
STUDIED CAN PROVIDE FOR INCREASED USABILITY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS IN A COST
EFFECTIVE MANNER, ESPECIALLY FOR INEXPERIENCED END USERS WHO CANNOT EASILY
AVAIL THEMSELVES OF EXPERT INTERMEDIARY SEARCHERS. FURTHERMO RE, MORE ADVANCED
INTERFACES BASED ON IMPROVED INSTRUCTION AND AUTOMATED SEARCH STRATEGY
TECHNIQUES COULD FURTHER ENHANCE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS FOR A WIDE CLASS OF
USERS. FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 PRECEDING ABSTRACT.
PUBLIC LIBRARY GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, 3RD TO 6TH APRIL: MAN, MACHINES AND
MANAGEMENT.

SUMMARIES OF PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE WEEKEND SCHOOL, WHICH WERE AS FOLLOWS:
BLAISE: A GREEN PAPER, BY DAVID MARTIN; THE TEXTUAL REVOLUTION, BY ANTHONY
SMITH; TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA, BY JIM BRUCE; HOW TO USE AN 'ON-LINE' REFERENCE
LIBRARY' AN EXAMINATION OF THE KINDS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM LOCKHEED
DIALOG, BY BRIAN COLLINGE; MANPOWER, MACHINES AND MANAGEMENT, BY JOHN ADAIR;
AND WORD PROCESSING AND HANDLING, BY T. MORGAN.
THE ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICE AT METROPOLITAN BRADFORD LIBRARIES'
ITS ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION, DECEMBER 1979-SEPTEMBER 1981.

DESCRIBES THE ESTABLISHMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF THE ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE
OPERATED BY METROPOLITAN BRADFORD LIBRARIES (UK) AS PART OF THE BRITISH
LIBRARY FUNDED PROJECT SI/G/353. THE TERMINAL WAS MAINLY USED TO CONDUCT
SEARCHES IN RESPONSE TO ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM MEDICAL PERSONNEL
WITHIN THE HEALTH DISTRICT, ALTHOUGH SOME STOCK REVISION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
CHECKS WERE DONE.
A STATE TRANSITION ANALYSIS OF ONLINE INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF ON-LINE SEARCHING PATTERNS COMPARED THE USAGE OF A
QUERY LANGUAGE BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF SEARCHERS. DATA WERE GATHERED BY AN
EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT, INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION FOR DATA ACCESS (IIDA),
CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPING AND TESTING A SYSTEM WHICH SERVES AS A TEACHER AND
ASSISTANT TO USERS OF LOCKHEED'S DIALOG SYSTEM. SEQUENTIAL LISTINGS OF USER
COMMANDS WERE CLASSIFIED BY CORRESPONDING STATE CODES TO REPRESENT PHASES OF
SEARCHING. ZERO- THROUGH 4TH-ORDER MARKOVIAN ANALYSES OF INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS
AND STRINGS OF LIKE COMMANDS WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE SEARCHING PROCEDURES
USED BY 3 CLASSES OF USERS.
THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE ACTIVITIES.

DESCRIBES A PROJECT AIMED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARY
REFERENCE SERVICES FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF USERS AND LIBRARY STAFF, AS WELL AS
CONSIDERING THE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS STOCK ACQUISITION, BUDGET AND
SPACE USE. PRESTEL AND TELETEXT RECEIVERS WERE INSTALLED FOR 12 MONTHS IN
REFERENCE LIBRARIES IN THE LONDON BOROUGHS OF BEXLEY, HOUNSLOW, SUTTON AND
WALTHAM FOREST AND IN BIRMINGHAM AND NORWICH CENTRAL REFERENCE LIBRARIES.
PRESTEL WAS FOUND TO BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENT TO EXISTING RESOURCES FOR
STATISTICAL, BUSINESS, NEWS AND LEISURE INFORMATION BUT THE STUDY INDICATED
FACTORS INHIBITING USE WHICH PRECLUDED MORE EXPERIMENTAL USE AND A MORE
THOROUGH TESTING OF THEIR APPLICATION IN REFERENCE LIBRARIES.
LOCAL COMMUNITY INFORMATION ON PRESTEL' USE OF THE BIRMINGHAM LOCAL
INFORMATION FILE.

A BRITISH LIBRARY FUNDED MONITORING STUDY OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY INFORMATION
FILE ON PRESTEL, COVERING THE BIRMINGHAM AREA (UK). DATA WERE COLLECTED BY
QUESTIONNAIRES SENT TO RESIDENTIAL USERS AND BY COLLECTING USE STATISTICS FROM
THE PRESTEL COMPUTERS. COVERS' FILE COMPOSITION AND DESIGN; COMPARATIVE USE OF
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FILE; TOPIC PREFERENCE AMONG USERS; AND VOLUME OF USE.
SHEDDING LIGHT ON TELETEXT.

DISCUSSES THE USE OF TELETEXT IN THE UK AND PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF A RECENT
SURVEY OF TELETEXT USERS CARRIED OUT BY CIT (COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY) RESEARCH (2TELETEXT AND PRESTEL' USER REACTIONS1). TELETEXT
APPEARS TO BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL RATHER THAN ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCE; IS
ACCESSED AN AVERAGE OF 1-4 TIMES DAILY BY EACH USER; AND IS MOST OFTEN USED
FOR NEWS, WEATHER, TRAVEL, AND SPORT. 93% OF USERS ARE SATISFIED, ALTHOUGH 29%
DESCRIBE IT AS INCOMPLETE. WARNS THAT CURRENT USERS ARE HIGHLY INNOVATIVE IN
THEIR APPROACH AND MAY NOT BE TYPICAL OF FUTURE USERS. CONCLUDES THAT A
DEFINITE CONSUMER MARKET EXISTS FOR TELETEXT.
MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT FROM ONLINE SEARCHES.

MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT (MRO) FROM ON-LINE SEARCHES IS USEFUL IN THE
COMPILATION OF LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIES. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH A MAJOR
ON-LINE RETRIEVAL VENDOR TO OBTAIN (FOR A FEE) OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF MAGNETIC
TAPE, RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL OFF-LINE PRINTS ON PAPER. A PROGRAMME WAS
WRITTEN TO TRANSFORM AND PROCESS THE DATA; PART OF THIS PROGRAMME IS SIMILAR
TO A COMPUTER COMPILER. A METHOD OF CHECKING FOR DUPLICATE ITEMS WAS
DEVELOPED. MRO IS COST-EFFECTIVE AND ELIMINATES THE TIME-CONSUMING AND
LABOUR-INTENSIVE DATA ENTRY PROCESS. IT IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE POWERS
OF ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
SWITCHING ON THE ELECTRONIC LIBRARY.

BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE COST OF USING 'ELECTRONIC LIBRARIES' (DATA BASES) AND
EXPLAINS WHY IT IS WORTH THE EXPENSE IN 3 AREAS-PATENTS, MEDICAL AND CHEMICAL
INFORMATION, AND THE LAW. REFERS TO THE PROBLEM OF CHOOSING APPROPRIATE TERMS
IN A DATA BASE SEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER-FRIENDLY ALMOST-FOOLPROOF
COMPUTER SYSTEMS. CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES, THESE ELECTRONIC
LIBRARIES ARE STILL MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN SYSTEMS SUCH AS PRESTEL.
ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING-SIZE, SHAPE, DILEMMAS OF ONLINE PUBLISHING.

A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON THE PUBLISHING OF ON-LINE DATA BASES. CONSIDERS THE
PRODUCTION AND PRICING OF PRINT AND MACHINE-READABLE FORMATS AS WELL AS THE
CHALLENGE OF FULL-TEXT ON-LINE SERVICES. AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS BECOMING
INFORMATION CONSCIOUS MORE DATA BASES OF POTENTIAL INTEREST TO THEM ARE BEING
DEVELOPED.
LACK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE JOURNAL TITLE DATA ELEMENT IN DATABASES.

THE PROBLEM OF DATA ELEMENT REPRESENTATION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MOST
PERCEIVE. THE NUMBER OF STANDARDS (INTERNAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL) IS
LARGE, BUT THE USE OF STANDARDS IN DATA BASES IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE RESULT IS
A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF STANDARDISATION BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS DATA BASES. THE
RESULT BECOMES APPARENT WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ON A PARTICULAR
DATA ELEMENT IN MULTIPLE DATA BASES. THE JOURNAL TITLE ELEMENT WAS STUDIED IN
8 DATA BASES, AND 4 MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF
STANDARDISATION WITHIN A DATA BASE AND SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR SEARCHING.
ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH AND THE EXISTING AVAILABLE DATA
BASES.

OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE LITERATURE RESEARCH COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL
METHODS SUCH AS LIBRARY SUBJECT CATALOGUES ARE' THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE
COMPLETE; THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS PRECISE DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
AND/OR COMBINATIONS; TIME IS SAVED AND THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY
PRINTED IN A HARDCOPY FORM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BE PHOTOCOPIED OR HANDWRITTEN.
IN WEST GERMANY, 75% OF COMPUTER STORED LITERATURE REFERENCES I.E. 70 MILLION
DOCUMENT UNITS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. 3
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DATA BASES IN WEST GERMANY ARE DIMDI (DEUTSCHES INSTITUT
FUR MEDIZINISCHE DOKUMENTATION UND INFORMATION, INKA (INFORMATIONSSYSTEM
KARLSRUHE) AND GID (GESELLSCHAFT FUR INFORMATION UND DOKUMENTATION). THE
LARGEST INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES ARE LOCKHEED, THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA)
AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY AUTOMATED INFORMATION SERVICE (BLAISE).
ONLINE INTERACTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES FROM THE INIS DATA BASE IN
HUNGARY.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE 10-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD OF THE ON-LINE RETROSPECTIVE
SEARCH SERVICE AT THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE
(OMKDK) OF HUNGARY. PRESENTS A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE AND SERVICES OF
THE INIS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) DATA BASE. THE MAIN
FEATURES AND OPERATION OF INTERACTIVE SEARCHING ARE DESCRIBED WITH AN
INTRODUCTION TO THE STAIRS SYSTEM USED FOR SEARCHING THE DATA BASE. GIVES AN
EXAMPLE OF AN ON-LINE SESSION.
MEDLINE ON DIALOG' A GUIDE TO SEARCHING TECHNIQUES.

DIALOG'S SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDLINE CONTAINS SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES.
MAJOR DIFFERENCES REGARDING DEFAULTS, DATA FORMS, WEIGHTING, SUBHEADINGS,
CHECK TAGS, AND CASCADED DESCRIPTOR CODES ARE DISCUSSED AND ILLUSTRATED
THROUGH SAMPLE SEARCHES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON COST-EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL.
PRE-MED, THE BRS CURRENT CLINICAL MEDICINE DATABASE.

PRE-MED IS A CURRENT CLINICAL MEDICINE FILE WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SERVICES AS A COMPANION FILE TO MEDLINE. PRE-MED
CONTAINS CITATIONS FROM 109 JOURNALS IN CLINICAL MEDICINE, NURSING, AND
HOSPITAL LITERATURE. PRE-MED IS SIMILAR IN FORMAT TO MEDLINE AND IS UPDATED
WEEKLY WITH ABOUT 500 CITATIONS. PRE-MED INDEXERS SUPPLEMENT THE JOURNALS'
TABLES OF CONTENTS WITH 2MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADINGS1. PRE-MED USES ILLUSTRATED
IN THIS ARTICLE INCLUDE BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATIONS, ACQUISITIONS SEARCHING,
UPDATING A MEDLINE SEARCH, AND TABLES OF CONTENTS SERVICES.
SEARCHING THE MEDLARS FILE FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY.

BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NLM ON-LINE DATA BASES CLINIC, 11 FEB 81. AS
THE ELDERLY POPULATION IN THE US INCREASES, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) HAS CREATED A
GERIATRIC RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL CENTRES PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE CARE,
SUPPORT RESEARCH, AND TRAIN PRACTITIONERS IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE. THROUGH THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE WADSWORTH VA MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY IN THIS PROGRAMME,
METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SEARCHING NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE
DATA BASES FOR INFORMATION ON THE ELDERLY. THESE METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED;
TERMS AND DEFINITIONS IN GERIATRICS ARE EXPLICATED; SAMPLE SEARCH REQUESTS ARE
EXPLORED; AND ON-LINE STRATEGIES ARE INDICATED.
THE MEASUREMENT OF TERM IMPORTANCE IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING.

THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF TERMS IN THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION HAVE
BEEN USED AS INDICATORS OF TERM IMPORTANCE FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS AND INDEXING
PURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, VERY RARE OR VERY FREQUENT TERMS ARE NORMALLY
BELIEVED TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN MEDIUM-FREQUENCY TERMS. RECENTLY AUTOMATIC
INDEXING THEORIES HAVE BEEN DEVISED THAT USE NOT ONLY THE TERM FREQUENCY
CHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES OF THE TERMS. THE MAJOR
TERM-WEIGHTING THEORIES ARE 1ST BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE TERM PRECISION AND TERM
UTILITY WEIGHTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TERMS
IN THE RELEVANT, AS OPPOSED TO THE NONRELEVANT, DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION ARE
THEN INTRODUCED. METHODS ARE SUGGESTED FOR ESTIMATING THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES
OF THE TERMS BASED ON THEIR OVERALL OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS IN THE
COLLECTION. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION RESULTS ARE SHOWN COMPARING THE
WEIGHTING SYSTEMS USING THE TERM RELEVANCE PROPERTIES WITH THE MORE
CONVENTIONAL FREQUENCY-BASED METHODOLOGIES.
ICL THROWS OUT ITS IPA CHALLENGE.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND FEATURES OF ICL'S INFORMATION PROCESSING
ARCHITECTURE WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN THE SUMMER OF 1980 TO COMPETE WITH IBM. THE
ARCHITECTURE INCLUDES BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND WAS DESIGNED TO ENCOMPASS
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS OFFICE AUTOMATION. DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF
LINKING UP WITH A TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.
UK FIRMS LAG IN HUNT FOR OFFICE MARKET.

EXPLAINS WHY THE UK HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE USA IN DEVELOPING OFFICE AUTOMATION.
DESCRIBES THE PLANS FOR EXPANSION OF THIS MARKET BY OFFICE TECHNOLOGY,
PLESSEY, ITT AND XEROX.
HIGHLIGHTING TRENDS IN OFFICE AUTOMATION.

OFFICE AUTOMATION PRODUCTS AND TECHNIQUES WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A SIZEABLE DENT
IN THE GROWING NUMBER OF OFFICE WORKERS AND BOOST PRODUCTIVITY OF THOSE
REMAINING AS WELL AS PROVIDING NEW MARKET FOR EQUIPMENT MAKERS. PRESENTS THE
RESULTS OF A SURVEY BY OFFICE AUTOMATION CONSULTANTS URWICK NEXOS INTO THE
DEVELOPMENTS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY 200 FIRMS. CONSIDERS EQUIPMENT AND BUDGETS,
COMPATABILITY, STAFFING AND PROBLEMS. THE SURVEY WILL BE PERFORMED EVERY 6
MONTHS AND THE RESULTS PUBLISHED IN 2COMPUTING1.
NAIVE USER IS BIG BUSINESS.

AS THE DATA PROCESSING INDUSTRY SEARCHES OUT NEW MARKETS IN WHICH TO GROW, IT
COMES UP AGAINST A HOST OF NEW INEXPERT USERS. REPORTS ON DEVELOPMENTS IN
USER-FRIENDLY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING SPEECH AND TOUCH INPUT. ARGUES THAT THE
INDUSTRY WHICH SHOULD INVOLVE USERS IN THE SYSTEMS DESIGN FOR THE TRAINING OF
DATA PROCESSING DESIGNERS HAS NEGLECTED ERGONOMICS.
DP THROWS AWAY ITS DULL DRAB WEEDS.

ASSESSES PLANS BY GOVERNMENT AND THE UK COMPUTER INDUSTRY TO EDUCATE THE
PUBLIC AND MOST PARTICULARLY BUSINESSES IN THE BENEFITS OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY DURING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY YEAR.
VISUAL LITERACY' A VITAL SKILL.

THE ABILITY TO DRAW APPROPRIATE MEANING FROM A VISUAL REPRESENTATION (OF
WHATEVER KIND) IS AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION SKILL. STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO
INTERROGATE MAPS, DIAGRAMS, PAINTINGS, PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER VISUAL IMAGES,
INCLUDING MOVING PICTURES, RECOGNISING SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS IN USE AND THEIR
LIMITATIONS. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONTENT AND CONTEXT, THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUPPORTING TEXTUAL OR AURAL ACCOMPANIMENT, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OF MANIPULATION AND BIAS, NEED TO BE CAREFULLY NURTURED. THE
VALUE OF PICTORIAL SOURCES FOR PRIMARY RESEARCH DATA IS EMPHASISED.
PUBLIC SCHOOL SATISFACTION OF INDIANA ESEA TITLE IV-B ADMINISTRATION, 1979-80.

REPORT OF THE STUDY CONDUCTED IN INDIANA TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
DIVISION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA IN ADMINISTERING THE ESEA IV-B PROGRAMME IN
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. STRONG POSITIVE SATISFACTION WAS SHOWN FOR THE DIVISION'S
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAMME, AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT MAJOR
CHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN ITS IV-B ACTIVITIES. IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE
GIVEN TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT ALL ARE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS OR REDIRECTION OF
ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION OF THE INDIANA
ESEA IV-B PROGRAMME.
COMPARATIVE HIGHER EDUCATION' A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW.

IDENTIFIES SOME MAJOR ISSUES WHICH HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF COMPARATIVE
RESEARCH INTO HIGHER EDUCATION, AS EVIDENCED IN THE LITERATURE. COMMON ORIGINS
OF HIGHER EDUCATION ARE NOTED. THE LITERATURE OF POST-1945 DEVELOPMENTS IS
SURVEYED, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE EXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,
ACCESS AND DEMOCRATISATION, POLITICISATION OF UNIVERSITIES, POLICY RESPONSES,
AND RESEARCH.
THE NEW ROOM AT THE MUSEUM OF FRENCH HISTORY. TECHNIQUES FOR VERTICAL
PRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTS.

IN REORGANISING THE MAJOR EXHIBITION ROOM AT THE MUSEUM OF FRENCH HISTORY, TO
PRESENT A PANORAMA OF THE HISTORY OF FRANCE UP TO 1940, NEW DOCUMENT DISPLAY
TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED. THE DRAWBACKS OF CONVENTIONAL DISPLAY METHODS,
USING HORIZONTAL WOOD AND GLASS CASES, ARE DISCUSSED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
NEW SYSTEM, THE MATERIALS USED, AND LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS; THE TECHNICAL
ADVANTAGES ARE OUTLINED, AND POPULARITY OF THIS METHOD WITH THE PUBLIC
EMPHASISED.
A SYSTEM OF MEASURING THE DYNAMICS OF READING.

THE DYNAMICS OF READING CAN BE DEFINED AS CHANGES IN READING HABITS PRODUCED
AS A RESULT OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE LAST 15 YEARS HAVE SEEN MUCH RESEARCH
IN THIS FIELD, BUT ALL HAS BEEN RELATED TO SPECIFIC TIMES AND LOCATIONS. THERE
IS A GROWING NEED FOR A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF REFERENCE, AND THIS PAPER
ATTEMPTS TO REVIEW SOME OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED. ONE SOLUTION
TO THE CHIEF PROBLEM, THAT OF MEASURING READING DYNAMICS, WAS SUGGESTED BY A
RESEARCH PROJECT AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY, WHICH DISCERNED 3 INDICATORS OF
CHANGE; PREVALENCE OF READING, ACTIVENESS AND CONTENT.
RESEARCH INTO THE READING HABITS OF SOVIET YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920S.

WITH THE RECOGNITION TODAY OF THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF WORK WITH CHILDREN,
NEW ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO THE EARLY ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE READING
BEHAVIOUR OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920S. BOTH LENIN AND KRUPSKAYA STRESSED THE
NEED FOR SOVIET LIBRARIANS TO GET TO KNOW THE NEEDS AND THE BACKGROUNDS OF THE
PEOPLE THEY WERE TRYING TO SERVE, BUT EARLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH INTO YOUNG
PEOPLE'S READING TENDED TO BE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN ACCURATE. IN LATER WORK
THE METHODOLOGY IMPROVED AND THE BASIS WAS LAID DOWN FOR MUCH OF TODAY'S
RESEARCH.
ORGANISING CHILDREN'S BOOK CLUB.

SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES, SCHOOLS, AND PUBLISHERS IN NIGERIA SHOULD SET UP
PAPERBACK BOOK CLUBS WITH THE AIM OF ENCOURAGING CHILDREN TO READ FOR
PLEASURE. DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH CLUBS, AND OFFERS ADVICE ON THEIR
ORGANISATION AND ACTIVITIES. LISTS SOME SUITABLE TITLES FOR THE FOLLOWING AGE
GROUPS' PRE-SCHOOL-7; 8-9; AND 10-11.
REGIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN QUEBEC SINCE 1970.

DISCUSSES REGIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN QUEBEC PROVINCE PRODUCED IN THE LAST 10
YEARS, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CANADIAN ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA IN GENERAL, PAST
AND PRESENT. FROM THE ANALYSIS OF 7 WORKS WHICH MEET THE CRITERIA, DERIVES
INFORMATION ON' NEW FACTORS AFFECTING DEVELOPMENT-THE GROWTH OF REGIONAL
AWARENESS, GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF SCIENTIFIC METHODS; AND
STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS-UNIVERSITY ORIGINS, SCALE, DISCIPLINARY FOCUS,
INDEXING TECHNIQUES, AUTOMATION, AND ACCESSIBILITY. CONCLUDES WITH PROPOSALS
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL.
FROM THE NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY, TOKYO. 1. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE 2JAPANESE
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY1.

RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO A GENERAL REQUEST TO ALL PARTICIPANTS AT THE
UNESCO/IFLA INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES, PARIS, SEPT 77
(2SEE1 78/1899) FOR INFORMATION ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS.
THE 2JAPANESE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY1 WAS ALREADY BEING COMPILED IN GENERAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE OPPORTUNITY IS TAKEN TO GIVE AN
ACCOUNT OF THE PUBLICATION, PLANS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, THE ROLE OF THE
NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY AS THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC AGENCY, AND THE RELATION
OF THE JAPANESE SCENE TO THE CONGRESS RECOMMENDATIONS.
SPOTLIGHT ON' BBIP.

THE BOOKS IN PRINT DATABASE (BBIP) IS A COMPREHENSIVE ON-LINE EQUIVALENT TO
THE R.R. BOWKER INDEXES TO US BOOK PUBLISHING. IT IS UPDATED MONTHLY, AND MORE
FREQUENTLY DURING PEAK PUBLISHING PERIODS SAVING VALUABLE WORKING TIME FOR
LIBRARIANS AND BOOKSELLERS. COVERS THE SCOPE OF THE DATA BASE, ACCESSION
NUMBERS, AUTHOR SEARCHING AND SUBJECT/TITLE SEARCHING WITH EXAMPLES.

THE HISTORY OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK COMMUNIST PARTY: A SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
BOOKS AND PERIODICAL ARTICLES BETWEEN 1970-1980.

ON THE OCCASION OF THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK
COMMUNIST PARTY, A SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY OF LITERATURE ON THE HISTORY OF THE
PARTY HAS BEEN PREPARED AS A PULL-OUT SUPPLEMENT OF THE 3 ISSUES OF CTENAR.
BIBLIOGRAPHY INCLUDES DOCUMENTS, MEMORIES, MONOGRAPHS, LEAFLETS AND
SUBSTANTIAL ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN COLLECTIONS OF WORKS AND PERIODICALS. IT IS
ORGANISED INTO CHAPTERS ACCORDING TO THE SIGNIFICANT PERIODS, SUCH AS'
WORKERS' MOVEMENT 1844-97, 1897-1917, THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE FOUNDING
OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK COMMUNIST PARTY 1917-21, 1939-45, 1945-48, 1948-69, THE
DEFEAT OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IN THE PARTY AND SOCIETY 1969-76, 1976-80.
PRINTING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE CENTURY OF GUTENBERG.

THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW PRINTED SOURCES CONCERNING BOOK PRINTING IN THE
15TH CENTURY IN GERMANY. MOST OF THE EXAMPLES ARE FROM SPAIN OR ITALY. FROM
VARIOUS SOURCES, MOSTLY PRINTERS WORK CONTRACTS, WE KNOW THE QUANTITY OF
FOOLSCAP PAGES WHICH THE FOLLOWING PRINTERS WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE DAILY' 1473
PHILIPPUS DE LAVAGNA IN MILAN 839 PAGES; 1475 ANDREAS PORTILIA IN BOLOGNA 880
PAGES; 1476 PETRUS MAUFER IN PADUA 1,247 PAGES; 1476 ABRAHAM BEN SOLOMON CONAT
IN MANTUA 1,000 PAGES; 1477 PETRUS MAUFER 1,332 PAGES; 1484 ANTONIO DI
BARTHOLOMEO MISCONINI IN FLORENCE 394 PAGES; 1499/1500 JOHANN LUSCHNER IN
MONTSERRAT 1,618 PAGES. DRAWS SOME GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS SURVEY. IN
THE MID 1470S PRINTERS WERE IN A POSITION TO PRINT ABOUT 900 FOOLSCAP PAGES
PER DAY PER PRINTING PRESS. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE
PRESSES HAD LED TO A GRADUAL INCREASE IN PRODUCTION TO ABOUT 1,200 PAGES A
DAY.
MACHINE READABLE CODES: A REVIEW OF THE PA'S TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION AND
OPERATING MANUAL.

REVIEW OF THE PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION'S 2MACHINE READABLE CODES FOR THE BOOK
TRADE' TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION AND OPERATING MANUAL1. THE WORK IS SUBDIVIDED
INTO AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION AND OPERATING MANUAL, AND
GUIDELINES. PROVIDES A RESUME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORK, A SUMMARY OF
THE BENEFITS TO THE BOOK TRADE, BRIEF CRITICISM OF THE WORK, AND A LIST OF
MEMBERS OF THE MACHINE READABLE CODES WORKING PARTY.
PROPOSAL FOR LEGAL AMENDMENT TO THE BELGIAN LAW OF 22 MARCH 1886 WITH
REFERENCE TO REPROGRAPHY.

2 SEPARATE PROPOSALS LAID BEFORE (1) THE BELGIAN SENATE IN MAR 81, AND (2) THE
BELGIAN CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES IN OCT 80 RESPECTIVELY. EACH BEGINS WITH A
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION SHOWING HOW TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE RENDERED
MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL LAW NECESSARY, INVOKING THE BERNE CONVENTION AS A
GUIDING PRINCIPLE. THE PROPOSALS THEN SET OUT IN DETAIL LARGELY SIMILAR
SUGGESTIONS FOR INSERTION OF AMENDMENTS, WITH COMPREHENSIVE COMMENT ON AND
JUSTIFICATION OF THE POINTS COVERED, WHICH INCLUDE THE NECESSITY FOR AUTHORS'
PERMISSION, LIMIT ON MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES, OBLIGATIONS OF OWNERS OF
REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT, AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL COMPENSATION.
GENERAL GUIDE TO THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1976.

THE GUIDE IS BASED ON LECTURES AND TRAINING CLASSES TO PREPARE THE COPYRIGHT
OFFICE STAFF AND INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1976, MOST PROVISIONS OF WHICH TOOK EFFECT 1 JAN 78. IN
DEVELOPING LECTURES AND LESSON PLANS, THE AUTHOR RELIED HEAVILY ON THE
LANGUAGE OF THE LAW ITSELF, THE LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, AND VARIOUS STATEMENTS OF
THE REGISTER OF COPYRIGHTS TO THE CONGRESS, I.E., THE 1961 REPORT OF THE
REGISTER, THE 1965 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT, AND THE 1975 SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL
REPORT. THESE DOCUMENTS MAY ALSO BE OBTAINED FROM NTIS. THIS GUIDE IS NOT AN
OFFICIAL SUMMARY OF THE LAW. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE
ISSUES RAISED BY THE REVISION LEGISLATION NOR TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO LEGAL
QUESTIONS. IT IS HOWEVER, AN EXTENSIVE TRAINING TOOL.
THE LINK BETWEEN PUBLISHING AND LIBRARIES IN THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST
REPUBLICS.

DESCRIBES THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH PUBLISHERS AND LIBRARIES WORK TOGETHER IN
THE SOVIET UNION, THIS BEING AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF ENSURING THE UNIVERSAL

SURVIVE IN THIS NEW ELECTRONIC AGE AND EMPHASISES THE VALUE OF THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE AND THAT THE UK SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION.
PUBLISHING IN THE AFRICAN LANGUAGE' PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS.

CONSIDERS REASONS WHY MANY BOOKS PUBLISHED IN THE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN LANGUAGES
ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY
CONDUCTED AMONGST THE MAIN PUBLISHERS OF MATERIAL IN THE AFRICAN LANGUAGES,
AND CONCLUDES THAT ONLY BOOKS WHICH ARE PRESCRIBED READING FOR EXAMINATIONS
SELL IN LARGE NUMBERS. NOTES WITH REGRET THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CENTRE OR
LIBRARY IN AFRICA THAT IS SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTING CREATIVE WRITING IN THE
AFRICAN LANGUAGES. ATTITUDES TO BOOKS AND READING IN AFRICA ARE SEEN AS BEING
GOVERNED BY MANY SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS, AND AS BEING ALSO HEAVILY
AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF RETAIL OUTLETS OR LIBRARIES.
ARGUES THAT, WHILST THE AFRICAN BOOK PROFESSIONS HAVE A MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY,
THE INITIATIVE FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE MUST LARGELY COME FROM GOVERNMENT BACKED
PROGRAMMES, AND INITIATIVES BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE AID OF THE MEDIA.

AUTHOR COMPOSING AT A TERMINAL TO THE FINISHED PRODUCT BEING MADE AVAILABLE IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM AND MENTIONS THE BRITISH LIBRARY FUNDED BIRMINGHAM AND
LOUGHBOROUGH ELECTRONIC NETWORK DEVELOPMENT (BLEND). IT IS UNLIKELY THAT
ELECTRONIC JOURNALS BY THEMSELVES CAN BE RUN PROFITABLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS; IT
IS MORE LIKELY THAT SYSTEMS WILL EVOLVE FROM, AND RUN ALONGSIDE, EXISTING
PUBLICATIONS WITH THEIR ESTABLISHED REPUTATION AND EDITORIAL STRUCTURE.
DISCUSSES THE DOCUMENT DELIVERY PROJECT ADONIS BEING DEVELOPED BY A GROUP OF
INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS. THE FULL POTENTIAL OF ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING WILL BE

PRICE INCREASES IN NATURAL SCIENCE PERIODICALS DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

INVESTIGATION WAS MADE INTO PRICE CHANGES DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS FOR 157
CURRENT NATURAL SCIENCE PERIODICALS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ULM. WHILE IN
THE PERIOD 1976-80 AN AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE OF 5% WAS RECORDED, AFTER
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THE INCREASE RATE FOR 1981 SEEMS TO BE MUCH HIGHER
COMPARED WITH 1980; THE AVERAGE RISE FOR 85 PERIODICALS APPEARS TO BE ABOUT
21%. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO LITERATURE DOCUMENTATION SERVICES WHICH ARE
RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE TO PRINT. FROM 11 INFORMATION SERVICES INVESTIGATED THE
PRICE INCREASE DURING 1976-80 WAS ABOUT 8.2% PER YEAR; THEIR PRICE RISE FOR
1981 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AS 13.2%. THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE RISES FOR

CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN ENGLISH' A SELECT, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY, 1835-1935.

SINCE THE 1950S THE STUDY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED INTO AN
AUTONOMOUS ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND INFORMATION CENTRES AS
WELL AS SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE FIELD HAVE PROLIFERATED. SEVERAL
SCHOLARLY PERIODICALS ARE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. CURRENT
ACADEMIC INTEREST IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE GROWING
NUMBER OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES FOR ADVANCED DEGREES. THIS TENDENCY IS ALSO
DISCERNABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA. AN INFORMATION CENTRE FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
AND MEDIA (ISKEMUS) WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH IN 1978.
POTCHEFSTROOM HAS AN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE WHICH HAS
ALREADY HELD 2 COUNTRY-WIDE SYMPOSIA AND HAS HAD A BOOK PUBLISHED UNDER ITS
AUSPICES BY TAFELBERG. ACADEMIC STUDY OF THE GENRE NECESSITATES THE FORMATION
OF COLLECTIONS OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS AND MEDIA REFLECTING THE PERSONAL BIAS AN D
INTEREST OF THE RESEARCHERS. SUCH COLLECTION BUILDING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE INVESTORS REGARD FINE CHILDREN'S BOOKS AS SOUND FINANCIAL
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR SCARCITY. AT STELLENBOSCH A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF
ABOUT 1,000 BOOKS REFLECTS THE CULTURAL INFLUENCE OF MAINLY VICTORIAN ENGLISH
MIDDLE-CLASS JUVENILE READING MATTER, 1830-1930. A VERY BRIEF INDICATION OF
SOME OF THE INTERESTING ITEMS IS REFLECTED IN THE SELECT, ANNOTATED ABSTRACT
OF THE CATALOGUE OF HISTORICAL BOOKS.

CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE' SELECTED EXAMPLES.

STAGES OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE, FAIRY STORIES, FOLK
TALES AND PLAYS FOR CHILDREN, PICTURE BOOKS AND SHEETS, NON-FICTION FOR YOUNG
CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS, RELIGIOUS BOOKS AND THE PREPARATION OF BIBLICAL TEXTS,
BOOKS ON DISCIPLINE AND MANNERS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC, INCLUDING LISTS OF IMPORTANT PUBLISHERS, PERIODICALS,
RESEARCH COLLECTIONS AND DISTRIBUTORS. BRIEF SURVEYS ARE ALSO MADE OF
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC, BULGARIA, RUMANIA,

SO WHO SUPPORTS THIRD LANARK NOW?.

COMPARES THE SCOTTISH LIBRARIES/BOOK TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD LANARK
VOLUNTEER RESERVES, WHO BECAME ONE OF SCOTLAND'S BEST KNOWN AND BEST LOVED
FOOTBALL TEAMS, YET STILL DISAPPEARED FOR EVER. IN 1980, SCOTTISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES SPENT APPROXIMATELY *64.5 MILLION ON BOOKS, 52% OF WHICH WAS SPENT
OUTSIDE SCOTLAND. EXPLAINS WHY THE SCOTTISH BOOK TRADE NEEDS THE LIBRARIES'
CUSTOM TO SURVIVE, WHY THE LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEIR PUBLIC TO
ORDER FROM THEIR NATIVE BOOK TRADE, AND HOW THE LIBRARIES AND BOOK TRADE
TOGETHER CAN MAKE A BASIC CONTRIBUTION TO SCOTTISH CULTURE.
THE LASER DISK INVASION.

RECENT MARKET SURVEYS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT OPTICAL DISKS ARE GOING TO BE VERY

THE PROBLEMS OF THE ROYAL LIBRARY' LACK OF SPACE, THE REVIEW OF SECURITY AFTER
SERIOUS THEFTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROYAL LIBRARY AND THE OTHER 2
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN COPENHAGEN. FEARS THAT A COMMON COURSE IN
LIBRARIANSHIP WILL NOT BE SPECIALISED ENOUGH FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES. SUPPORTS
A JOINT DIRECTORATE FOR THE RESEARCH AND PUBLIC LIBRARY SECTORS UNDER THE
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, BUT BELIEVES IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE LIBRARIES AND THEIR
MOTHER INSTITUTIONS UNDER DIFFERENT MINISTRIES, AND WARNS AGAINST
BUREAUCRATISATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ADMINISTRATIVE UNIFICATION. SUPPORTS THE
PRINCIPLE OF NO-CHARGE FOR COMPUTER BASED DOCUMENTATION SERVICES. HOPES THAT
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE RESEARCH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN. THE NEW LIBRARY ACT, WHICH WILL ALSO
ENCOMPASS RESEARCH LIBRARIES, SHOULD HELP IM PROVE THEIR PUBLIC IMAGE.

REFERENCES; WIDTH OF COVERAGE; QUALITY OF INDEXING; AND QUANTITY OF
REFERENCES. ISSUES COVERING A 1 YEAR PERIOD (1979) WERE EXAMINED AND RESULTS
FOR EACH PERIODICAL COMPARED. ADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE ALSO COMPARED'
LANGUAGE OF MATERIAL INDEXED, COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN, TYPE OF MATERIAL, INCLUSION
OF INDEXES, AND PRICE. THE FINAL CONCLUSION DRAWN WAS THAT THE 2 PERIODICALS
ARE LARGELY SIMILAR APART FROM VARIATIONS IN INDEX PROVISION, CLASSIFICATION
PROCEDURE, AND PRIMARY SOURCES COVERED.
THE SHOCK THAT HURTS.

DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR RESEARCH INTO LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE COMMUNICATION OF
RESULTS TO LIBRARIANS. OUTLINES' THE TYPE OF RESEARCH NECESSARY; WHO SHOULD DO
IT AND WHERE, SUGGESTING THAT LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF AND STUDENTS ARE
PREFERABLE; AND FUNDING FROM LIBRARY AND UNIVERSITY BUDGETS AND US GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES. MEANINGFUL RESEARCH WILL FOLLOW ONLY WHEN THERE IS CONSENSUS ON THE
REALITY OF CONCERNS AND A PERCEIVED WILLINGNESS IN LIBRARIANS TO INVITE
SOLUTIONS AND INNOVATION.
ISORID-A CRITIQUE.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF, AND COMMENTS CRITICALLY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF
UNESCO'S INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM ON RESEARCH IN DOCUMENTATION
(ISORID). THE ISORID PROGRAMME WAS LAUNCHED IN THE EARLY 1970S AS AN
INTERNATIONALLY-DIMENSIONED MECHANISM FOR THE RECORDING OF PLANNED, ONGOING,
AND COMPLETED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH, AND DURING A PERIOD
OPERATED AS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN FID AND UNESCO. CONCLUDES THAT A NUMBER OF
PROBLEMS AND SYNDROMES CHARACTERISE ISORID' MUCH RELEVANT INFORMATION IS NOT
FINDING ITS WAY INTO THE SYSTEM; THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE TIME-LAGS BETWEEN THE
RECORDING OF R&D PROJECTS AND THEIR LISTING IN THE PRINTED SERVICES;
SOPHISTICATION AND OPTIMISATION OF SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS ALONG WITH A HIGHER
DEGREE OF 'USER FRIENDLINESS' IS REQUIRED; AND A REAL USER STUDY WOULD BE
DESIRABLE.
INTERVIEW. MARIA ANTONIETA FERRAZ.

AN EMINENT BRAZILIAN LIBRARIAN ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON HER CAREER. TOPICS COVERED
INCLUDE HER EXPERIENCES AS A STUDENT ON BRAZIL'S 1ST LIBRARY SCIENCE COURSE;
HER INVOLVEMENT IN THE FORMATION OF THE 1ST SPECIAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
ITS ACTIVITIES; THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE TEACHING AND THE CREATION
OF PROGRAMMES; AND HER ATTITUDES AND PRINCIPLES AS A TEACHER OF LIBRARY
SCIENCE TO YOUNG BRAZILIANS TODAY.
IN MEMORIAM. MARCEL KOELBERT 1903-1979.

HOMAGE BY A PERSONAL FRIEND, GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THE CAREER OF KOELBERT, WHO
FROM 1932-62 WAS CHIEF LIBRARIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALGIERS. HERE KOELBERT
CREATED AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION CENTRE DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN
THE SITUATION. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS.
ULRICH'S REFERENCES TO MICROFORM AVAILABILITY.

ATTEMPTING TO USE ULRICH'S INTERNATIONAL PERIODICALS DIRECTORY AS A GUIDE TO
THE AVAILABILITY OF MICROFORM OF MANY JOURNALS CAN BE MISLEADING. A QUICK
SURVEY OF 25 TITLES LISTED IN THE GUIDE TO MICROFORMS IN PRINT SHOWS THAT
ULRICH'S LISTED AVAILABILITY FOR ONLY 30.76%. THE SURVEY ALSO BROUGHT OUT THAT
SOME OUTSTANDING US GOVERNMENT TITLES ARE NOT LISTED IN ULRICH'S.
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS.

ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF US GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS ON HEALTH AND HEALTH
RESEARCH, BY SEVERAL REVIEWERS. ITEMS INCLUDE 2ALCOHOL HEALTH AND RESEARCH
WORLD, JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, RESEARCH RESOURCES REPORTER,
SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN1, AND 2WORLD HEALTH FORUM1.
A SURVEY OF ARCHITECTURE MAGAZINES.

REVIEWS, BY ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS AND/OR THE ART LIBRARIES SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA, OF 54
ARCHITECTURE JOURNALS. JOURNALS FALL INTO SEVERAL BASIC SUBJECT CATEGORIES,
INCLUDING A PRIMARY GROUP OF STANDARD PROFESSIONAL JOURNALS, AMERICAN AND
NON-AMERICAN; US STATE AND REGIONAL ARCHITECTURE PERIODICALS; AND INTERIOR
DECORATION AND DESIGN MAGAZINES.
THE IMPORTANCE OF ANNOTATIONS AND REVIEWS IN BOOK SELECTION.

BRIEFLY EXAMINES WHAT BOOK SELECTION, REVIEWS AND ANNOTATIONS ARE, AND
SUMMARISES THE IMPORTANCE AND SHORTCOMINGS OF ANNOTATIONS AND REVIEWS IN BOOK
SELECTION.
COMPUTER-TO-COMPUTER COMMUNICATION IN THE ACQUISITION PROCESS.

THE WORK OF BISAC (BOOK INDUSTRY SYSTEMS ADVISORY COMMITTEE) IN DEVELOPING AND
PROMOTING ON-LINE ACQUISITION VIA DIRECT COMPUTER-TO-COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND IN
PRODUCING A STANDARD FORMAT FOR DATA INTERCHANGE IS DESCRIBED.
ELECTRONIC ORDER TRANSMISSION.

ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY CENTER (OCLC) PLANS TO USE THE BISAC (BOOK INDUSTRY
SYSTEMS ADVISORY COMMITTEE) DATA TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL AND FIXED DATA FORMAT
IN THEIR ON-LINE ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM. ISBNS WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY
PUBLISHERS AND STANDARD ADDRESS NUMBERS (SAN), DEVELOPED BY BISAC, TO IDENTIFY
LIBRARY VENDORS, PUBLIC, ACADEMIC AND AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
ONLINE ORDERING. A COMPARISON OF DOCUMENT SUPPLIERS.

DESCRIBES A STUDY WHERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SIMULATANEOUSLY
ORDERED ON-LINE FROM 9 SELECTED DOCUMENT SUPPLIERS. CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES
AS TO COST, SPEED OF DELIVERY AND RELIABILITY OF DELIVERY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.
THIS IS RELATED TO THE TYPE OF DOCUMENT, THE COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION AND THE
SUBJECT CONTENT OF THE MATERIAL. ON-LINE ORDERING AS A ROUTINE IN LIBRARY
ACQUISITION WORK IS DISCUSSED.
THE DEUTSCHE STAATSBIBLIOTHEK AS A CENTRE FOR INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNION
CATALOGUING.

IN THE 1970S THE LIBRARY FOUNDED A SPECIAL INSTITUTE TO COPE WITH
INTER-LIBRARY LOANS AND UNION CATALOGUING. THE INSTITUTE'S WORK HAS INCLUDED
ACCELERATING ORDERING PROCEDURES, ORGANISING COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT AND
INTERNATIONAL INTER-LOAN SCHEMES, IMPROVING STAFF QUALIFICATIONS, SOLVING
LEGAL PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING, KEEPING
CATALOGUES UP TO DATE AND DEVELOPING A COURIER SERVICE. SINCE 1978 STATISTICS
HAVE BEEN COMPILED ON THE 400 LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN TELETEXT SERVICES. CURRENT
PROJECTS INCLUDE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CENTRAL UNION CATALOGUE AND OF THE
INDEX OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND SERIALS. THE INSTITUTE PLAYS AN ACTIVE PART
IN INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES.
TRANSPORT SCHEMES FOR INTERLIBRARY LENDING' THE UK EXPERIENCE.

WHERE POSTAL SERVICES ARE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR EXPENSIVE, DEDICATED TRANSPORT
SCHEMES FOR INTERLENDING PURPOSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; THEIR USEFULNESS WILL
VARY FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ACCORDING TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE UK,
FEASIBILITY STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED BY THE SETTING UP OF TRANSPORT SCHEMES IN A
NUMBER OF THE UK LIBRARY REGIONS, AND A NATIONAL SCHEME LINKING THE REGIONS
WAS ENVISAGED. TRANSPORT SCHEMES WERE NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE IN THE LARGER
REGIONS WITH LESS INTERLENDING ACTIVITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING UP SCHEMES
HAS BEEN DEVISED. THE PRESENT TRANSPORT SCHEMES ARE FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVE
AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO. UK EXPERIENCE MIGHT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING
POTENTIAL SCHEMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.

COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION PROVISION' 2INFORMATION AT ANY PRICE' ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION
SERVICES1, IN WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INTERLENDING FROM SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES SHOULD BE CHARGED AT A STANDARD RATE PER LOAN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT
CHARGING FOR TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMISSION'S
REMIT. 1 REASON FOR CONSIDERING CHARGES NONETHELESS IS THE INCREASING SCOPE
AND COST OF INTERLENDING. ANOTHER IS THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGETING OF
INSTITUTIONS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WHICH HAS TRANSFERRED LIBRARY ALLOCATIONS
FROM THE STATE TO THE INSTITUTIONS; THESE ARE TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS
THROUGH CHARGES ON INTERLENDING. THE REPORT REGARDS INTERLENDING OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE COST OF
INTERLENDING, NOR THE COST OF ADMINISTERING A SYSTEM OF CHARGES.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS.

INTERLENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLY
OF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AND A REGIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING A WIDER RANGE OF
MATERIAL MAINLY BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 725,000 REQUESTS WERE MADE IN 1979.
MOST REQUESTS ARE SATISFIED THROUGH UNION CATALOGUES OR PRINTED UNION LISTS.
IN ADDITION TO THE 12 PROVINCIAL CENTRES, THE 13 REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES
HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY SYSTEM; THEY RECEIVED 131,708
REQUESTS IN 1980 AND SATISFIED 27%. A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION IS
RECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40% OF ALL REQUESTS
AT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20%
FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60%), FOR
ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),
AND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS). THE
SATISFACTION RATE WAS 76% (HIGHER FOR REQ UESTS SENT TO UNION CATALOGUES): 1/2
WERE SUPPLIED IN 2 WEEKS, 2/3 IN 3 WEEKS IMPORTANT GAPS IN JOURNAL COVERAGE
WERE IDENTIFIED. AN ON-LINE NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 1984
AND WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE REQUESTS MORE EVENLY BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BUT
SPECIFIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE INTERLENDING FUNCTION IN MAJOR SUPPLYING
LIBRARIES WILL STILL BE NECESSARY, AND CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE. IMPROVED UNION
CATALOGUES ARE ENVISAGED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALSO.
A PROPOSAL FOR PLANNING AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM FOR THE LIBRARIES OF CAIRO
CITY, EGYPT.

(PHD DISSERTATION-PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY). A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY, INTERVIEWS,
VISITS, AND A LITERATURE ANALYSIS WERE USED TO EXPOSE THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE PRESENT STATE OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN IN CAIRO. A SYSTEM FOR FORMAL
INTERLIBRARY LENDING WHICH CAN BE MODIFIED FOR OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS
PROPOSED.
PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

BASED ON REPORTS DESCRIBING THE EXTENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN
SYSTEMS IN SEVERAL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, A COMPOSITE IS DRAWN OF THE
DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS WHICH ARISE IN THE PLANNING STAGES AND EXECUTION OF
SUCH SYSTEMS IN THESE COUNTRIES. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, AS WELL AS PROBLEMS OF
LIBRARY POLICY, AND THE REALISTIC POSSIBILITIES CONNECTED WITH THE LITERATURE
SUPPLY AND CORRESPONDING NEED FOR AN INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROGRAMME IN THESE
COUNTRIES ARE POINTED OUT. ATTENTION IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARIES TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY. CONSIDERATIONS WHICH SHOULD BE MADE
IN FINDING REALISTIC SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS CONCLUDE
THE REPORT.
CORE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.

CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THAN
DECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SO
PARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TO
CENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF
JOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7,000-8,000 TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80% OF
DEMAND AND 2,000 TITLES 50% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS IN
IDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWN
TO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING
DIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUS
FACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSE
VARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES
(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTS
BASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT
SUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IF
A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HAS
ADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TO
ACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALS
IN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,
BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCH
COLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.
ONLINE INTERLIBRARY SERVICES' AN INFORMAL COMPARISON OF FIVE SYSTEMS.

5 AUTOMATED NORTH AMERICAN INTERLOAN SYSTEMS ARE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THEIR
EFFECTIVENESS FOR LOCATING RESOURCES AND COMMUNICATING REQUESTS. 2 OF THE
SYSTEMS ARE PRIMARILY ON-LINE CATALOGUES, 1 OF WHICH, ONLINE COMPUTER LIBRARY
CENTER (OCLC), HAS A SOPHISTICATED INTERLIBRARY LOAN SUBSYSTEM, AND THE OTHER,
RESEARCH LIBRARIES INFORMATION NETWORK (RLIN), HAS A FORMATTED RESEARCH
LIBRARIES MESSAGE SYSTEM USED TO TRANSMIT INTERLOAN REQUESTS. COMPUTER LIBRARY
SYSTEM INC. AND LIBRARY COMPUTER SYSTEM ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR LOCAL
ON-LINE CIRCULATION, AND THEIR USE HAS BEEN EXTENDED FOR RESOURCE SHARING.
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEM (UTLAS), IS PROMOTED AS AN
INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM WITH ON-LINE ACCESS TO A UNION CATALOGUE AND
AVAILABILITY OF AN ELECTRONIC MAILBOX TO COMMUNICATE REQUESTS.
WEEDING: THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE OF GETTING RID OF DEAD WOOD IN THE LIBRARY
COLLECTION.

ATTEMPTS TO GIVE THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS' DEFINITION OF 'WEEDING', DISCUSSES
REASONS FOR AND AGAINST WEEDING OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS, AND SUGGESTS POSSIBLE
SOLUTIONS TO ARGUMENTS AGAINST WEEDING, AND WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH WEEDED STOCK.
BOOK THEFT AND BOOK MUTILATION IN A LARGE URBAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

A QUESTIONNAIRE STUDY OF WHY STUDENTS IN A LARGE US URBAN UNIVERSITY STEAL AND
MUTILATE LIBRARY BOOKS AND PERIODICALS IDENTIFIED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND
SOCIOLOGICAL MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS IN THE STUDENTS. CIRCUMSTANTIAL REASONS FOR
SUCH DEVIANT BEHAVIOUR WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THIS STUDY. THE INDIVIDUAL
STUDENT'S PERCEPTIONS OF PRESSURE FOR SOURCES IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD SEEMED TO
MOTIVATE MUTILATION AND THEFT REGARDLESS OF THE QUALITY OF AVAILABLE LIBRARY
SERVICE. PEER APPROVAL FOR THESE BEHAVIOURS WAS NOT APPARENTLY ASSUMED.
A SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY ON THE CONSERVATION OF RESEARCH LIBRARY MATERIALS.

SELECTION OF ENTRIES IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT IS MOST USEFUL TO
LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS CONCERNED WITH CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL
MATERIALS.
THE BOOK PRESERVATION PROBLEM AS SEEN AT HARVARD.

PAPER PRESENTED AS A LECTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, 27 FEB 81.
DESCRIBES WAYS IN WHICH HARVARD UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANS HAVE TACKLED THE
PROBLEMS OF BOOK PRESERVATION FROM THE 17TH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT DAY.
DISCUSSES' THE PROTECTION OF BOOKS FROM PEOPLE; EFFORTS MADE TO PROTECT BOOKS
FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND NON-HUMAN HAZARDS; REPAIR AND RESTORATION; THE USE OF
COOPERATIVE MICROFILMING; THE PRODUCTION AND PUBLICATION OF MICROFILMS; AND
THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESERVATION ACTIVITIES.
LIBRARY BINDING AS A CONSERVATION MEASURE.

EXAMINES THE PROBLEM OF HOW LIBRARIANS CAN CHOOSE SUITABLE BINDINGS FOR BOOKS
MEANT FOR PERMANENT RETENTION IN THE ARCHIVAL COLLECTION. DISCUSSES' THE MAIN
FEATURES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMERCIAL BINDING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE; BINDING
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF MATERIAL; SPECIAL BINDING OPTIONS WHICH BINDERS CAN
OFFER THEIR CUSTOMERS; EXAMINING VOLUMES ON THEIR RETURN FROM BINDING; AND
IN-HOUSE BINDING OPTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARY BINDING CAN BE A CONSERVATION
MEASURE TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE VOLUME AND CONSERVE IT IF METHODS ARE
SENSIBLY SELECTED AND APPLIED, AND INDICATES THE MOST ACCEPTABLE METHODS FROM
A CONSERVATION VIEWPOINT.
THE BOOK HOUSE IN LARSBODA.

IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE WAS THE CONTACT
BETWEEN THE BOOKBINDER, EDVARD HASSLER, AND THE LIBRARY SERVICE, WHICH LED IN
1952 TO THE CREATION OF THE JOINT BINDING SERVICE. HASSLER HAS RECENTLY MOVED
TO NEW PREMISES IN LARSBODA, WHERE THE LIBRARY SERVICE HIRES 4000 SQ.M. SPACE
FOR THE BINDING SERVICE. B. SKOLD DESCRIBES THE USES OF THIS SPACE AS STORE,
DISTRIBUTION AREA, OFFICES AND EXHIBITION HALL, WHERE THE WORK OF THE SERVICE
IS DISPLAYED. E. HASSLER DESCRIBES THE HISTORY OF THE BINDERY FROM ITS START
IN 1902 AND ITS COOPERATION WITH THE LIBRARY SERVICE SINCE 1952. TODAY IT
BINDS 2.6 MILLION LIBRARY VOLUMES AND PREPARES 400,000 PUBLISHERS' VOLUMES.
THE NEW BUILDING IN LARSBODA HOUSES HASSLERBAND, WHICH IS AN UMBRELLA
ORGANISATION FOR 3 BINDERIES' LIBREX, SAMBOK AND KNUT HASSLER.
EVALUATION OF LIBRARY BINDINGS.

REVIEWS THE WORK OF THE TESTING LABORATORY AT THE LIBRARY BINDING INSTITUTE AT
ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS THE STANDARD-PRODUCING BODY FOR
THE USA. DISCUSSES DECREASING BUDGETS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON LIBRARY BINDING
METHODS, ALTERNATIVE BINDINGS, COMPETITION AMONG LIBRARY BINDERS, BOOK
PERFORMANCE TESTING, TESTING EQUIPMENT, SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF METHODS,
SERVICES TO LIBRARIANS AND NEW SPECIFICATIONS FOR ALTERNATE BINDING METHODS.
BOOK THEFTS AND MUTILATION IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

AFTER TRACING REPORTED INCIDENCES OF BOOK THEFTS AND MUTILATION IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES, DISCUSSES THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE 2 ACTS IN THE 13 NIGERIAN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. A TABLE DEPICTS THE EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE OF DIFFERENT
SECURITY PROBLEMS IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.
EFFECTIVE USE OF EXISTING SPACE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, JUNE 81. EXAMINES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS
CONCERNED WITH THE EFFECTIVE USE OF STACK, STUDY AND SERVICE SPACE IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES. CONSIDERS THE USE OF WEEDING AND MICROFILMING AS WAYS OF
CONTROLLING STACK SPACE, AND SUGGESTS METHODS OF INCREASING UTILISATION OF
FLOOR SPACE. DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROVISION OF ADEQUATE STUDY
SPACE, AND DESCRIBES OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE INSTALLATION OF AN ON-LINE
INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM OFFERS FOR INCREASING THE EFFICIENT USE OF SERVICE
SPACE.
USE OF THE LIBRARY RESERVE COLLECTION AT DEPAUW UNIVERSITY.

UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE IF THE PATTERN OF USE OF LIBRARY RESERVE COLLECTIONS
FOUND AT OTHER COLLEGE LIBRARIES CONTINUES TO EXIST AT DEPAUW, THIS STUDY
FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ALL THE RESERVE COLLECTION ITEMS NEVER
CIRCULATED DURING THE ENTIRE SEMESTER, AND THAT 33% OF THE COLLECTION
CIRCULATED ONLY 1-5 TIMES DURING THAT PERIOD. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT LIBRARIANS
EXAMINE THEIR RESERVE COLLECTIONS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT
EXPENDED ON THEM, AND TO PREVENT THEM FROM DISCOURAGING MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF
THE LIBRARY. STATISTICAL TABLES AND REFERENCES ARE PROVIDED. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
CIRCULATION SYSTEMS PAST AND PRESENT.

REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIRCULATION SYSTEMS SHOWING 2 AREAS OF CHANGE. THE
LIBRARIAN'S PERCEPTION OF CIRCULATION CONTROL HAS SHIFTED FROM A BROAD SERVICE
ORIENTATION TO A NARROW RECORD-KEEPING APPROACH AND RECENTLY BACK AGAIN. THE
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF CIRCULATION SYSTEMS HAS EVOLVED FROM MANUAL
SYSTEMS TO THE ON-LINE SYSTEMS OF TODAY. THE TRADE-OFFS AND DEFICIENCIES OF
EARLIER SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO THE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES MADE POSSIBLE BY THE
ON-LINE COMPUTER ARE DETAILED.
THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM MARKETPLACE' ACTIVE AND HEATING UP.

SURVEYS THE MARKET FOR COMPUTERISED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS OVER THE PERIOD
1977-81. A FINAL TOTAL OF 11 SYSTEMS ARE COVERED AND INFORMATION IS GIVEN FOR
THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS INSTALLING EACH SYSTEM, THE RANGE OF SIZES OF
INSTALLED SYSTEMS AND THE STATUS OF FUNCTIONS OF TURNKEY CIRCULATION VENDORS
AS OF 1 OCT, 81.
AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR COLLECTION MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL.

DISCUSSES THE AUTOMATION OF CIRCULATION SYSTEMS AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, WITH
REFERENCE TO EXPERIENCES IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED
LIBRARY SYSTEM AT THE LISTER HILL NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL
COMMUNICATIONS, NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE, BETHESDA, USA. DESCRIBES THE
AREAS OF AUTOMATION SUPPORT THAT WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO COLLECTION MANAGEMENT
AND CONTROL, AND INDICATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM IS
INCORPORATING AND DEVELOPING THESE AREAS.
AUTOMATED LOAN SYSTEM AT THE STATE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY IN KOSICE.

SURVEYS THE IMPACT OF AND THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE APPLICATION OF
AUTOMATION ON DAY TO DAY WORK AT THE STATE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY (SSL) IN KOSICE.
THE USE OF PUNCHED TAPES FOR THE PREPARATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES, REPORTS,
ABSTRACTS AND DOCUMENTS FOR PUBLICATION PROVED VERY USEFUL. SYSTEM TESLA RPP
16S WITH REAL TIME OPERATION IS BEING USED FOR THE PROCESSING OF LOANS. THE
ORGANISATION OF WORK CONNECTED WITH IT IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL.
MICROCOMPUTER BACKUP TO ONLINE CIRCULATION.

MICROCOMPUTER BACK-UP SYSTEMS TO BE USED IN EVENT OF FAILURE OF ON-LINE
MINICOMPUTER CIRCULATION SYSTEMS ARE INVESTIGATED.
BASIC BOOKS V. GNOMON: COPYRIGHT INTERPRETATION 'UNREASONABLE'. LIBRARIANS
READ THE SETTLEMENT AS 'LAW' AND UNDULY RESTRICT COPYRIGHT USERS.

DISCUSSES COPYRIGHT ISSUES RAISED IN THE US SUIT 2BASIC BOOKS V. GNOMON1 WITH
IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARIES. STATEMENTS BY THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
PUBLISHERS HAVE CREATED THE ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION THAT THE TERMS OF THE
2GNOMON1 SETTLEMENT ARE LAW, CONCERNING ILLEGAL PHOTOCOPYING OF DOCUMENTS.
LABORATORY NOTEBOOK STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.

DESPITE THE GENERAL CONCLUSION THAT LABORATORY NOTEBOOKS CONTAIN VALUABLE AND
OFTEN NEEDED DATA, THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE DISCUSSION IN THE
LITERATURE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADEQUATE STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR
THEM. TO DETERMINE THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM, A SURVEY OF 83
FOOD SCIENCE LIBRARIES WAS CONDUCTED. 60% OF THE LIBRARIES EMPLOYED SOME KIND
OF A SYSTEM. 4 DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WERE IDENTIFIED; AND THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED
ACCESS BY NOTEBOOK AUTHOR AND NOTEBOOK ACCESSION NUMBER WAS PREDOMINANT.
CATALOGUING IN THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY' DEVELOPMENT AND TENDENCIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING, REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY USES THE RAK RULES FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES; FURTHER STREAMLINING WILL
BE CARRIED OUT HERE BECAUSE THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY WILL SHORTLY JOIN THE
BAVARIAN NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' INTERLOAN SYSTEM. KEYWORD USE IS
STANDARDISED; A KEYWORD INDEX PUBLISHED EVERY 6 MONTHS ASSISTS IN UNIFYING
PRACTICE. ENGLISH KEYWORDS ARE USED FOR BIOLOGY AND PRE-CLINICAL MEDICINE,
GERMAN FOR OTHER SUBJECTS. REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY'S OWN CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
IS USED HERE AND IN OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE INTERLOAN SCHEME. SINCE 1974
PRINTED CATALOGUE VOLUMES HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COM-PROCESS MICROFICHE, WHICH
MAY IN TURN BE REPLACED BY ON-LINE METHODS WHEN THESE HAVE BECOME CHEAPER.
ACCESS TO OTHER REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORKS MAY SOON BE AVAILABLE THROUGH
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
UNIT TIME/COST STUDY OF THE CATALOGING UNIT, TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION,
TUCSON PUBLIC LIBRARY.

THE 2ND OF 3 REPORTS IN A SERIES TO DETERMINE UNIT TIME AND COST ESTIMATES FOR
THE MAJOR OPERATIONS OF THE TECHNICAL SERVICES DIVISION OF THE TUCSON PUBLIC
LIBRARY. DAILY LOGS WERE RECORDED BY PERSONNEL IN THE CATALOGUING UNIT IN THE
SPRING OF 1978, AND THE DATA FORMS THE BASIS OF THIS REPORT. CATALOGUING
PROCEDURES ARE DISCUSSED AND A WIDE DIVERGENCE OF COSTS ARE DEVELOPED. ADDED
COPY CATALOGUING DONE PRIMARILY BY PARAPROFESSIONALS IS COMPARED TO ORIGINAL
CATALOGUING PERFORMED BY PROFESSIONALS. THE IMPACT OF MULTIPLE COPIES IS
DISCUSSED AS A FACTOR IN REDUCING UNIT COSTS, AND DETAILED APPENDICES ALLOCATE
TIME AND COSTS FOR PRINT AND NONPRINT MATERIALS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
ALA FILING RULES.

A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE 2ALA FILING RULES1 IS GIVEN, TOGETHER WITH
COMMENTS, IN AN EARLIER ABSTRACT (81/5757).
LINKING OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES RECOMMENDED IN BATTELLE/CLR STUDY.

THE BATTELLE/CLR STUDY ANALYSED THE ECONOMIC AND SERVICE BENEFITS TO LIBRARIES
AND THEIR USERS OF LINKING NETWORKS FOR 3 LIBRARY OPERATIONS-SHARED CURRENT
MONOGRAPH CATALOGUING, INTERLIBRARY LOAN, AND REFERENCE SEARCHING. CONCLUDES
THAT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, OCLC, INC., THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES INFORMATION
NETWORK AND THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK SHOULD DEVELOP ON-LINE LINKS USING
AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION OF REQUESTS AND RESPONSES. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE
ALSO DISCUSSED.
DESIGN SPECIFICATION OF THE BARR SMITH LIBRARY ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM
(BIBLION).

DESCRIBES THE OBJECTIVES AND PRESENTS A SYSTEMS OVERVIEW OF BIBLION-THE
ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM OF THE BARR SMITH LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
ADELAIDE. DISCUSSES' THE LOCATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND HOLDINGS INFORMATION;
LOCAL AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK REFRESHER TAPE INPUT; THE RECORDING OF
DETAILED HOLDINGS; INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM LIMITATION; AND PERFORMANCE
AND SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS.
BIBLION' THE ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM OF THE BARR SMITH LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT, FEATURES AND USE OF BIBLION-THE ON-LINE
BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM OF THE BARR SMITH LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE.
BIBLION IS USED FOR THE PRODUCTION CATALOGUE OF THE UNDERGRADUATE COLLECTION,
THE CATALOGUE OF MONOGRAPHS SELECTED FOR STORAGE, AND THE MEANS OF ACCESS TO
ABN (AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK) FOR THE USE OF ALL ABN FUNCTIONS
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.
IN LINE TO GET ON LINE.

IN JAN 80, AN AD HOC CONSORTIUM OF SOME 30 SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED COLLEGE AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WAS FORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
REPLICATABLE ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGUE. THE GROUP, CONDOC (CONSORTIUM TO
DEVELOP AN ON-LINE CATALOG), CAME INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE MANY SMALLER ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES SAW THEIR ON-LINE CATALOGUE REQUIREMENTS AS DIFFERENT TO THOSE OF
LARGE RESEARCH LIBRARIES. CONDOC ALLOWED THE POOLING OF EXPERTISE. ITS 1ST
MEETING TOOK PLACE AT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MIDWINTER MEETING,
1980. DESCRIBES ITS WORK TO DATE.
THESIS/DISSERTATION PROCESSING AND OCLC.

AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPACT THAT OCLC CAN HAVE ON CATALOGUING PROCEDURES, AN
EXAMINATION OF THE HANDLING OF THESES AND DISSERTATIONS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN LIBRARY DEMONSTRATES THAT CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS
CAN BE REALISED WITHOUT SACRIFICING OR ELIMINATING SEVERAL SPECIAL FILES WHICH
ARE USED EXTENSIVELY BY LIBRARY STAFF AND PATRONS WHILE MAKING THE MATERIALS
AVAILABLE FOR PATRON USE MUCH MORE QUICKLY.
LIBRARY NETWORKING IN AUSTRALIA' THE PAST IS FUTURE.

TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT PROPOSALS BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA TO
PRODUCE A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY NETWORK (ABN). THE LICENCE FOR A SOFTWARE
PACKAGE, DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED AT THE WASHINGTON STATE LIBRARY, KNOWN AS
THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK, WAS ACQUIRED IN 1980 AFTER CONSIDERABLE
TESTING. PUTS THE PROPOSALS IN THE BROADER CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY ARE SET. THEY
SYSTEM HAS 4 MAIN COMPONENTS' ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE; ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SOURCE FILE; CATALOGUE PROCESSING; AND CATALOGUE PRODUCTION. CONCLUDES THAT
THE SYSTEM WILL NOT SUCCEED FOR ECONOMIC REASONS-IT BUNDLES WITH ITS OFFERINGS
A PROCESSING CAPABILITY WHICH IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE AT A LOWER COST.
ABN AND THE ART OF COST-EFFECTIVE CATALOGUING: THE CHALLENGE IN LIBRARY
AUTOMATION FOR THE EARLY EIGHTIES.

THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA HAS RECEIVED PERMISSION TO DEVELOP AN
AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK (ABN), BUT NO EXTRA RESOURCES HAVE BEEN
GRANTED FOR IT; THE SERVICE MAY THEREFORE NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE ALL ITS
POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS AS QUICKLY AS SOME WOULD LIKE. SUGGESTS THAT THROUGH
THE CREATION OF 'SERVICE CENTRE' NETWORKS, AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A MAJOR
SUPPORTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE BENEFITS OF THE ABN'S
EXISTENCE CAN BE BROUGHT TO A GREAT MANY LIBRARIES. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH ABN
MAY BE INTEGRATED INTO A NATIONAL NETWORK WHICH WILL COORDINATE THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY'S INITIATIVES AND THE 'BOTTOM-UP' DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY
TAKEN PLACE AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE.
MARC FORMAT SIMPLIFICATION.

(SUMMARY OF A PAPER COMMISSIONED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES TASK
FORCE ON BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL). EXAMINES THE NEED FOR THE MARC FORMAT TO BE
ABLE TO RESPOND TO FUTURE POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS PARTICULARLY OF ON-LINE
CATALOGUING.
ANATOMY OF THE MAIN ENTRY.

BASIC INTRODUCTION TO THE CONCEPT OF MAIN ENTRY IN CATALOGUING-THE NAME OR
TERM UNDER WHICH THE WORK IS PRIMARILY ENTERED BOTH ON A CATALOGUE CARD AND IN
A BIBLIOGRAPHY. DESCRIBES THE IMPRINT, COLLATION, PAGINATION, ILLUSTRATIONS,
SIZE AND NOTES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAIN ENTRY IN CATALOGUING.
THE GENERAL CATALOGUE OF PRINTED BOOKS, 1881-1981.

ON 30 APR 1881, GEORGE BULLEN, THE KEEPER OF PRINTED BOOKS, LAID BEFORE THE
TRUSTEES OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM THE 1ST PRINTED PART OF THE CATALOGUE OF BOOKS
IN HIS DEPARTMENT. 25 YEARS LATER, ON COMPLETION THE CATALOGUE OF 2 MILLION
ENTRIES BECAME AN ESSENTIAL REFERENCE WORK AS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RECORD OF
PRINTED PUBLICATIONS IN EUROPEAN LANGUAGES. IN A MODIFIED FORM IT IS STILL IN
USE IN THE LIBRARY. PRESENTS A HISTORICAL REVIEW OF THE PRODUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CATALOGUE FROM 1881 TO 1981.
THE CARD CATALOG' CURRENT ISSUES, READINGS AND SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY.

40 CONTRIBUTIONS AIMED AT PROVIDING IN-DEPTH COVERAGE FOR LIBRARIANS NEEDING
TO DECIDE ON WHETHER AND WITH WHAT TO REPLACE THE CARD CATALOGUE. INCLUDES
CONSIDERATION OF COSTS, STAFF INVOLVEMENT AND THE EFFECTS ON USERS.
USER EDUCATION FOR AN ONLINE CATALOG' A WORKSHOP APPROACH.

FOR MORE THAN 6 YEARS, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES HAVE HAD PUBLIC
TERMINALS AVAILABLE FOR SEARCHING THEIR LIBRARY CONTROL SYSTEM (LCS), A FORMER
CIRCULATION SYSTEM THAT IS EVOLVING INTO AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. PATRON
INSTRUCTION IN USE OF THE SYSTEM HAS EXPANDED IN PARALLEL WITH THE EVOLUTION
OF LCS, MOVING FROM INFORMAL PRINTED INSTRUCTIONS TO A STANDARDISED 1 HOUR
WORKSHOP. A YEAR OF EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THE WORKSHOP TO BE A VALUABLE PART OF
THE LIBRARIES' USER-EDUCATION PROGRAMME AND A PARTICULARLY SUITABLE APPROACH
FOR ON-LINE CATALOGUE INSTRUCTION.
ALIEN IN THE READING ROOM.

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS REPLACING ITS CARD CATALOGUE WITH A COMPUTERISED
CATALOGUE. DESCRIBES THE REACTIONS OF A REFERENCE LIBRARIAN WHEN A TERMINAL
WAS INSTALLED IN THE READING ROOM. SEARCHING WAS SPEEDED UP, WITH THE
POSSIBILITY OF LIMITING SEARCHES TO CERTAIN DATES, LANGUAGES OR PLACES OF
ORIGIN. DISCUSSES THE COMPONENT WORD SYSTEM WHICH RESPONDS TO A COMMAND TO
FIND WORDS ANYWHERE IN THE TITLE, SUBJECT HEADINGS, AUTHOR'S NAME, SERIES, OR
NOTES ON A BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRY, THUS ENABLING LIBRARIANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF INCOMPLETE CITATIONS. IN MAY 77 A COMPUTER CATALOGUE CENTRE WAS ESTABLISHED
FOR THE PUBLIC NEAR THE MAIN CATALOGUE, WHICH HAS PROVED EXTREMELY POPULAR. A
USER SURVEY SHOWED THAT COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION IS NEEDED. FUTURE PLANS
ARE OUTLINED.
COM CATALOGUE EXPERIENCE AT ANU.

CHARTS THE HISTORY OF AUTOMATED CATALOGUING AT THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, WHICH BEGAN IN 1974. MARC TAPES WERE OBTAINED FROM THE
AUSTRALIAN MARC RECORD SERVICE AND THE CATALOGUING OF NEW BOOKS FOR THE LIFE
SCIENCES LIBRARY ONTO COMPUTER RECORDS WAS SET TO BEGIN IN 1976. FROM 1 JAN 81
ALL CATALOGUING WILL BE IN AACR 2 AND AUSMARC III.
COMPARING FICHE AND FILM' A TEST OF SPEED.

SPEEDS OF SEARCHING MICROFILM AND MICROFICHE COM CATALOGUES WERE MEASURED AND
COMPARED. SEARCHING OF MOTORISED MICROFILM CATALOGUED WAS FOUND TO BE
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN SEARCHING MICROFICHE FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS. THE
SLOWEST FILM TIME WAS FASTER THAN MOST FICHE TIMES. RESULTS SUGGESTED,
HOWEVER, THAT FREQUENT USERS MIGHT IMPROVE THEIR SEARCHING TIMES AND MAY THEN
BE ABLE TO SEARCH FICHE FASTER THAN FILM.
COLORADO UNION CATALOG.

DISCUSSES THE PRODUCTION OF THE COLORADO UNION CATALOG, WHICH IS BASED ON THE
PROCESSING OF MAGNETIC TAPES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH
IS THE COLORADO MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL OCLC TAPES. CONSIDERS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS
INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCT, IN PARTICULAR THAT
OF DECIDING WHICH RECORD TO ACCEPT AS THE DEFINITIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION
OF A TITLE HELD BY SEVERAL LIBRARIES.
THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SITUATION AND THE NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE, (PART) 2'
THE LONG APPROACH.

THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS LONG
BEEN FELT BY REFERENCE LIBRARIANS. THE NEED WAS PARTLY FULFILLED IN 1970 WHEN
THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GREATER COPENHAGEN PUBLISHED A CATALOGUE OF THEIR
PERIODICAL HOLDINGS. IN THE PROVINCES COVERAGE IS VERY UNEVEN AND WITH GROWTH
IN INTERLENDING THE NEED FOR A UNION CATALOGUE IS NOW ACUTE. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
JOINT COMMITTEE IS NOW CONSIDERING A PROJECT ON SUCH A CATALOGUE AND HAS ASKED
THE LIBRARY CENTRE TO PREPARE AN EDITORIAL PLAN FOR INPUT OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
DATA INTO ITS DATA BASE. IT NOW APPEARS THAT INPUT CANNOT BEGIN FOR FINANCIAL
REASONS UNTIL 1 JAN 84. APPEALS TO THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE TO INITIATE A
DEBATE ON THE PRIORITIES WITHIN THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. FOR AN ABSTRACT OF
PART 1 IN 2BIBLIOTEK 701 (4) 1982, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING SERIAL NUMBER'-

DOBIS-WLN IMPACT STUDY. REPORT.

THE BCUC STUDY TEAM EXAMINED 3 SYSTEMS FOR POSSIBLE APPLICATION TO THE BRITISH
COLUMBIA UNION CATALOGUE' WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK, DOBIS AS IMPLEMENTED BY
COLLEGE BIBLIOCENTRE AND DOBIS AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
CANADA. IT WAS FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SYSTEMS WOULD BE USABLE BY BCUC WITHOUT
SOME MODIFICATION. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY VERSION OF DOBIS WAS SELECTED WITH THE
QUALIFICATION THAT MORE INITIAL WORK WOULD BE NEEDED THAN THE OTHERS TO BRING
IT INTO PRODUCTION.
PEOPLE SHOULD BROADEN THEIR OUTLOOK: SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD.

LIBRARIANS STILL COPE BADLY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NARROW CATCHWORD BECAUSE
THEIR TERMINOLOGICAL CONTROL IS STILL INEFFECTIVE. THE NARROW CATCHWORD USES
PRECISE TERMINOLOGY AND SEPARATES RELATED MATERIAL; THE BROAD CATCHWORD COVERS
WIDE SUBJECT AREAS AND TENDS TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF HIERARCHIES OF
SUBORDINATED GROUPS. DIE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK (GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY) USES
MAINLY NARROW CATCHWORDS, EQUATING THIS WITH PRECISE SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION
BUT OCCASIONALLY DEVIATIONS FROM THIS PRINCIPLE OCCUR. CATCHWORDS IN SOME
SUBJECT AREAS ARE NARROWER THAN IN OTHERS. TERMINOLOGY IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED
AND THIS IS ESSENTIAL WHEN PRECISE TERMS ARE USED. IF PRECISE SUBJECT
DEFINITION AND STRICT TERMINOLOGY CONTROL ARE CLOSELY LINKED THEN IT FOLLOWS
THAT PRECISE SUBJECT DEFINITION CAN ONLY BE CARRIED OUT IN THE USER'S INTEREST
WHEN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF WELL-TRAINED STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.
WHAT KIND OF LIBRARY SYSTEM SHOULD I CHOOSE?.

DISCUSSES THE CHOICE OF CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR GENERAL BOOK COLLECTIONS
DRAWING PARTICULARLY ON EXPERIENCES AT THE FOLKSAM LIBRARY, FACK, SWEDEN,
WHICH SPECIALISES IN INSURANCE. ANY NEW LIBRARY MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE
ADAPTATION OF SYSTEMS TO COMPUTERISATION. RECOMMENDS THE USE OF THE
'ALPHABETIC SYSTEM' OF CLASSIFICATION, WHICH PROVIDES BROAD AND GENERAL
HEADINGS FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF SUBJECTS. MAIN HEADINGS OF THE SYSTEM ARE
GIVEN.
RUDOLPH FOCKE AND THE THEORY OF THE CLASSIFIED CATALOG.

BETWEEN 1900 AND 1905, RUDOLPH FOCKE PUBLISHED A SERIES OF PAPERS ON
CLASSIFICATION THEORY AND A DRAFT OF CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSIFIED
CATALOGUES. HIS WORK WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE REFORM OF LIBRARIANSHIP
DURING THE LAST DECADES OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THE LARGE NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED BY GERMAN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES WAS
SEEN AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL AND ACCESS. THE HOPE OF STANDARDISATION CAME TO NOTHING; FOCKE'S CODE
MAY EVEN HAVE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF PERPETUATING LOCAL SYSTEMS WELL INTO
THE 20TH CENTURY. HIS WORK WAS INTRODUCED TO LIBRARIANS IN THE USA AT A TIME
WHEN SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION WERE IN TRANSITION. HIS CODE IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
CLASSIFICATION, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INFLUENCED BY 19TH CENTURY GERMAN
CLASSIFICATION THAN HAS HERTOFORE BEEN RECOGNISED. RE PORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
LC CLASSIFICATION KEY' A COMPARISON OF CLASSES A-P WITH THEIR Z COUNTERPARTS.

THE BIBLIOGRAPHY SECTION (Z CLASS) OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SYSTEM IS OFTEN
CONFUSING TO REFERENCE LIBRARIANS AND TO USERS. A KEY HAS BEEN PREPARED
SHOWING A COMPARISON OF THE MAIN CLASSES AND SUBCLASSES FOR A TO P WITH THEIR
CORRESPONDING Z NUMBERS. THE METHOD FOR PREPARING THIS KEY AND THE PROBLEMS
ENCOUNTERED ARE EXPLAINED.

ENVIRONMENT. LISTS IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE BY COMPUTERISING THE SCHEME,
INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF KEYWORD SEARCHING AND THE LIFTING OF SPACE
CONSTRAINTS, AS WELL AS ASPECTS THAT THE MACHINE CANNOT CORRECT-TERMINOLOGY
AND THE ABSENCE OF USEFUL REFERENCES.
PRE-AACR2 SPECIAL RECORDS: CORNELL'S EXPERIENCE WITH A CLOSED CATALOG.

PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTING FORMS OF ENTRY FOR SERIAL AND MONOGRAPH
TITLES IN AACR2, AND DUE TO THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY INVOLED IN MAINTAINING
AN 8 1/2 MILLION CARD CATALOGUE, THE UNION DICTIONARY CATALOG IN CORNELL
UNIVERSITY'S OLIN RESEARCH LIBRARY WAS CLOSED ON 31 DEC 80. AT THE BEGINNING
OF 1981 A NEW CATALOGUE-THE SUPPLEMENTAL CATALOG-WAS OPENED, AND SUPPLEMENTAL
CATALOGS ALSO REPLACED OTHER CATALOGUES ON THE CORNELL CAMPUS. SERIALS IN THE
SUPPLEMENTAL CATALOGS ARE CATALOGUED ENTIRELY ACCORDING TO AACR2, AND
MONOGRAPHS HAVE AACR2 NAME HEADINGS BUT INCLUDE SOME HYBRID RECORDS WITH
PRE-AACR2 DESCRIPTIVE ELEMENTS. THE CLOSURE AND NEW CATALOGUING ARE DESCRIBED
IN DETAIL.
SUBJECT THESAURUS PERMUTATED LISTING.

ENTRY TO A LARGE MULTIDISCIPLINARY THESAURUS CONTAINING BOTH SINGLE AND
MULTI-WORD DESCRIPTORS PRESENTS PROBLEMS TO THE EXPERIENCED AS WELL AS THE NEW
USER. THIS PERMUTATED LISTING HAS BEEN PREPARED TO ALLEVIATE THESE PROBLEMS.
EACH DESCRIPTOR HAS BEEN PERMUTATED ACCORDING TO EACH SIGNIFICANT WORD IN
SINGLE AND MULTI-WORD ENTRIES AND LISTED ALPHABETICALLY. THIS TYPE OF LISTING
WILL' (1) PROVIDE THE USER WITH THE CORRECT THESAURUS ENTRY; AND (2) PERMIT
REVIEW OF GENERICALLY RELATED DESCRIPTORS SEPARATED BY ALPHABETISATION IN THE
THESAURUS.
HEALTH CARE MICROTHESAURUS' A HIERARCHIAL LIST OF INDEXING TERMS USED BY NTIS.

THE MICROTHESAURUS WAS PREPARED BY NTIS TO HELP NTIS DATA BASE USERS RETRIEVE
HEALTH CARE RELATED REPORTS AND TO PROVIDE AN INDEXING VOCABULARY FOR THE
HEALTH CARE INFORMATION COMMUNITY. MORE THAN 1,400 MAIN TERMS AND THEIR
HIERARCHIES ARE LISTED, EXPRESSING HEALTH CARE CONCEPTS INCLUDING THOSE FOR
HEALTH CARE COSTS, EDUCATION, DELIVERY, AND OCCUPATIONS. ALSO INCLUDED ARE
TERMS COVERING RESOURCES, MANPOWER, TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES, USE, AND
LEGISLATION. IN SOME INSTANCES A SHORT DEFINITION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO CLARIFY
A SPECIAL USE OF A TERM BY NTIS.
SELECTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. CASE
STUDY (MIRROR NEWSPAPER GROUP).

AN ACCOUNT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO THE LONDON MIRROR NEWSPAPER
GROUP'S SELECTION OF ANCIRS (AUTOMATED NEWS CUTTING INDEXING RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM), AND ITS OPERATION IN THE DAILY MIRROR DOCUMENTATION SERVICE. DETAILS
ARE GIVEN OF THE NATURE AND SIZE OF INFORMATION HOLDINGS, AND THE VOLUME OF
QUERIES HANDLED, WHICH LED TO THE DECISION TO REPLACE THE EXISTING
CONVENTIONAL MANUAL SYSTEM. THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A NEW SYSTEM ARE
OUTLINED AND RELATED TO ANCIRS CAPABILITIES. A BRIEF SKETCH IS GIVEN OF HOW
MATERIAL IS NOW INDEXED AND RESEARCH DEMANDS HANDLED, AND IN CONCLUSION THE
SUCCESS OF THE CHANGE IS EVALUATED IN TERMS OF SPACE SAVED, INCREASED
EFFICIENCY OF SERVICES, AND REDUCTION OF PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.
MANAGING EXXON'S TECHNICAL REPORTS.

THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EXXON REPORTS IS MANAGED BY USE OF AN
IN-HOUSE, COMPUTERISED SYSTEM THAT BUILDS A DATA BASE AND PRODUCES
CURRENT-AWARENESS 'REPORT ALERTS', VARIOUS INDEXES INCLUDING A SUBJECT KWIC,
AN ON-LINE DATA BASE, AND REPORTS-DISTRIBUTION CONTROL. KEY ELEMENTS IN THE
SYSTEM ARE: (1) A STRUCTURAL REPORT NUMBER THAT INCORPORATES CODES FOR THE
ISSUING UNIT, MAJOR SUBJECT, AND DATE; (2) NATURAL-LANGUAGE INDEXING SENTENCES
THAT MAKE UP A PSEUDO ABSTRACT; AND (3) CONTROLLED SUBJECT CATEGORIES THAT ARE
A BASE FOR THE 'REPORTS ALERTS' SYSTEM.

CONSIDERED AND THE BRAD UPDATE BRADLINE RECRUITMENT AND MEDIATEL SERVICES FOR
ADVERTISERS ARE EXAMINED. THE GATEWAY METHOD OF ACCESSING A PRIVATE COMPUTER
USING THE PUBLIC VIEWDATA SYSTEM IS REVIEWED AND TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA ARE
COMPARED. PRESTEL'S STRATEGY FOR INCREASING ITS USERS IS DESCRIBED AND THE
PRIVATE SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDERED.
TELEPHONE COMPANIES VERSUS CABLE TV.

SUMMARISES THE FINDINGS OF A RECENT INTERNATIONAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, INC.
RESEARCH REPORT. IT ACCUSES BOTH TELEPHONE COMPANIES AND CABLE TELEVISION
OPERATORS OF 'EXCESSIVE TIMIDITY' IN THEIR CURRENT EXPERIMENTATION WITH
INTERACTIVE CONSUMER SERVICES, BUT PREDICTS THAT 'HIGH-CONSUMER-EXCITEMENT'
PROGRAMMING WILL STIMULATE DEMAND WITHIN THE NEXT 2-3 YEARS. LISTS THE DRIVING
FORCES, CONSTRAINTS AND POSSIBLE NEW SERVICES IDENTIFIED BY THE REPORT.
VIEWDATA-WHAT'S IN IT FOR INDUSTRIAL MARKETERS?.

A BRIEF TECHNICAL OUTLINE OF VIEWDATA IS PROVIDED AND THE MARKETING VALUE OF
THE TECHNOLOGY IS ASSESSED. IT IS FELT THAT VIEWDATA CAN TAKE THE ROUTINE
INFORMATION HANDLING LOAD OFF THE ENQUIRY DEPARTMENT AND IMPROVE THE
EFFICIENCY OF THE SALESMAN'S ROLE BY ENHANCING AND COMPLEMENTING THE PERSONAL
SERVICE OFFERED. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTERACTIVE QUALITIES OF VIEWDATA AS
OPPOSED TO THE PRINTED MEDIA IS STRESSED AND BRIEF CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO
SECURITY AND COSTS OF A VIEWDATA SYSTEM.

NO ABSTRACT AVAILABLE.
PROVIDING INFORMATION ON CURRENT RESEARCH BY WAY OF DATA BASES.

OWING TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, A GREAT VARIETY OF
DATA BASES ARE NOW EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC BY MEANS OF TERMINALS.
REGARDING THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
IN THE NETHERLANDS DECIDED TO INQUIRE INTO THE OPINIONS OF SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCHERS WORKING FOR INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE COUNCIL, ON FREE
ACCESS TO DATA BASES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON CURRENT RESEARCH IN ORDER TO
FIND OUT WHETHER THIS INFLUENCES CONTENTS AND FORMULATION OF PROJECT
DESCRIPTIONS. THE QUESTIONS CONCERNED THE NATURE OF THE RESEARCH, THE USE OF
AND THE INPUT INTO INFORMATION SYSTEMS BY THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHER IN
QUESTION AND HIS/HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS FREE ACCESS TO RESEARCH IN PROGRESS.
WHICH DATABASE? AN EVALUATIVE GUIDE TO ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES IN
BUSINESS AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.

A GUIDE TO THE RANGE AVAILABLE AND THE FACILITIES AND USES OFFERED, FOR
INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS AND LIBRARIANS WHO USE THE SERVICES LESS THAN
CONSTANTLY AND WISH TO INCREASE THEIR FREQUENCY OR IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS.
COVERS FACTUAL AND NUMERIC AS WELL AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES. AN ANNUAL
UPDATE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE ON SUBSCRIPTION FROM THE AUTHOR AT PRESTON
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY AND LEARNING RESOURCES CENTRE.
ACOMPLINE' AN ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE SETTING UP OF ACOMPLINE (ACOMPLIS BEFORE 1981) BY THE
GREATER LONDON COUNCIL'S RESEARCH LIBRARY. THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM, ACOMPLIS (A
COMPUTERISED LONDON INFORMATION SERVICE), WAS INTRODUCED IN 1973 TO PROVIDE
THE RESEARCH LIBRARY WITH IN-HOUSE FACILITIES; INCLUDING COM INDEXES TO THE
LIBRARY'S STOCK, SPECIAL INDEXES, BIBLIOGRAPHIES, SDI AND BATCH (OFF-LINE)
SEARCHING. IN 1981, WITH THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
SERVICES (ESRIN) ACTING AS HOST, ACOMPLINE WAS LAUNCHED AS THE 1ST
COMPREHENSIVE ON-LINE DATA BASE IN THE FIELD OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION.
COMPARISON OF RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS DATA BASE IN
SEARCHES PERFORMED THROUGH DIALOG AND ESA-QUEST.

REPORT OF RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AT THE SPANISH NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE (CENIDOC). IDENTICAL SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED THROUGH
THE DIALOG AND ESA-QUEST SYSTEMS, USING 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 (CA), FOR EQUAL
LENGTHS OF TIME. FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE INITIAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS TO
EXPLAIN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN REFERENCES RETRIEVED, AND THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE CA FILE. RESULTS OBTAINED USING A WIDE VARIETY OF SEARCH
CRITERIA ARE PRESENTED. THE SYSTEMS AGREED ONLY WHEN REGISTRATION NUMBERS OR
PERIODICAL CODES WERE USED, AND MORE INFORMATION WAS ALWAYS OBTAINED THROUGH
DIALOG USING INDEXING TERMS. THE CONCLUSION REACHED IS THAT QUEST DOES NOT USE
THE COMPLETE CA SEARCH, AND DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ITS LIMITATIONS.
NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES IN SUBJECT COMMUNICATION AND
DOCUMENTATION' ECONOMY, COSTS, FINANCE AND ORGANISATION.

ON-LINE SERVICES AND SCREEN DISCS ARE PROMINENT AMONG NEW TECHNICAL
DEVELOPMENTS IN WEST GERMANY AND ARE USED MAINLY BY SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. THEIR USE HAS RESULTED IN AN ECONOMIC TREND TOWARDS
COOPERATION BETWEEN SIMILAR FIRMS OR ORGANISATIONS OR BETWEEN COMPLEMENTARY
BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY. THE ON-LINE MARKET IS INTERNATIONALLY ORIENTED AND THE
MARKET LEADERS ARE MAINLY FROM ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES. THE ON-LINE
INFORMATION MARKET HAS DEVELOPED MORE SLOWLY IN WEST GERMANY THAN IN
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THIS SHOULD INCLUDE' DEVELOPING
INFORMATION POLICY WITH REGARD FOR ECONOMIC ASPECTS; ENCOURAGING COOPERATION
BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS AND USERS; AND CONCENTRATING THE RESTRICTED SUPPLY OF
GOVERNMENT MONEY SO AS TO FAVOUR THE GROWTH OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.
QUANTIFIABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES.

(EXTENDED VERSION OF THE LECTURE 'QUANTIFIZIERBARE MERKMALE VON DATENBANKEN',
PRESENTED AT THE DEUTSCHER DOKUMENTARTAG, WEST BERLIN, 1980.) CONSIDERS THE
QUANTIFIABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES FROM THE ON-LINE
USER'S VIEWPOINT. GIVES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DATA BASE PROPERTIES WHICH HAVE
BEEN STUDIED QUANTITATIVELY' COVERAGE, CURRENCY, COSTS, ACCURACY, INDEXING AND
RETRIEVAL EFFICIENCY. INDICATES THE VALUE OF SUCH STUDIES TO THE ON-LINE USER
AND WHERE FURTHER STUDIES WOULD BE USEFUL.
BIBLIO-DATA' THE DATA BANK AT THE GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY.

BIBLIO-DATA HAS DEVELOPED SINCE 1975 INTO THE BIGGEST LITERATURE DATA BANK FOR
ON-LINE SEARCHING IN WEST GERMANY. BY DEC 81 IT WAS LINKED TO 66 INSTITUTIONS
IN GERMANY AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND HAD ACCESS VIA THE STAIRS
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM TO EURONET DIANE. OVER 900,000 DOCUMENTARY UNITS ARE
AVAILABLE AND 100,000 ARE ADDED ANNUALLY. THE DATA BANK AIMS TO INCLUDE
REFERENCES TO ALL NEW GERMAN MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS, ALTHOUGH NOT TO
PERIODICAL ARTICLES, AND RETRIEVAL IS POSSIBLE VIA ALL IMPORTANT DATA
ELEMENTS. IN SERVICE QUALITY AND QUANTITY BIBLIO-DATA IS AHEAD OF MOST PRINTED
BIBLIOGRAPHIES; A SPECIAL FEATURE IS A LARGE STORE OF DISSERTATIONS FROM BOTH
EAST AND WEST GERMANY. CORRECTIONS, HOWEVER, CANNOT YET BE MADE AND SOME
ASPECTS OF CATALOGUING REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT.
REFERENCE RETRIEVAL WITHOUT USER QUERY FORMULATION.

DESCRIBES A COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SATISFYING INCOMPLETELY
DEFINED USER NEEDS THROUGH A MAN-MACHINE DIALOGUE WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE A
QUERY FORMULATION BY THE USER. THE PROGRAM ATTEMPTS TO SATISFY THE USER'S
NEEDS FROM A MODEL WHICH IT BUILDS OF HIS INTERESTS; A MODEL WHICH IS A SUBSET
OF ITS OWN WORLD MODEL (THE DATA BASE). EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE
PROGRAM CREATING VIRTUAL WORLD MODELS TO PREVENT THE NEED FOR UNNECESSARILY
ACCESSING THE WHOLE DATA BASE AND INCORPORATING A FORM OF WEIGHTING BASED ON
ASSOCIATION STRENGTHS BETWEEN ITEMS IN THE DATA BASE.
THE USE OF AUTOMATIC INDEXING FOR AUTHORITY CONTROL.

THESAURUS-BASED AUTOMATIC INDEXING AND AUTOMATIC AUTHORITY CONTROL SHARE
COMMON GROUND AS WORD-MATCHING PROCESSES. TO DEMONSTRATE THE RESEMBLANCE, AN
EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM UTILISING AUTOMATIC INDEXING AS ITS CORE PROCESS WAS
IMPLEMENTED TO PERFORM AUTHORITY CONTROL ON A COLLECTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS. DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM ARE GIVEN AND RESULTS DISCUSSED. THE BENEFITS
OF EXPLOITING THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE 2 SYSTEMS ARE EXAMINED.
THE SUITABILITY OF BOOK AND ARTICLE TITLES FOR SUBJECT CATALOGUING.

FOR ECONOMIC REASONS THE VIABILITY OF AUTOMATED SUBJECT CATALOGUING USING MAIN
ENTRIES IS OFTEN CONSIDERED. BASIC DATA AVAILABLE FOR THIS ARE THE TITLE,
SUB-TITLE AND CIP DATA BUT ALTHOUGH THE TITLE MAY IMPORTANT IT DOES NOT ALWAYS
EXPRESS THE SUBJECT CONTENT ACCURATELY. IN POPULAR LITERATURE THE TITLE MAY BE
EYE-CATCHING RATHER THAN ACCURATE. PROBLEMS CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, ABBREVIATIONS, SHORTENED OR LENGTHENED NAMES FOR THE SAME OBJECT,
HOMONYMS AND SYNONYMS, ESPECIALLY IN GEOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL. MANY TITLES ARE
VAGUE AND INCOMPLETE OR EVEN INCOMPREHENSIBLE IF THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK IS
NOT ALREADY KNOWN. USE OF THE TITLE IN AUTOMATED SUBJECT CATALOGUING WOULD
SAVE WORK TIME BUT RESULT IN MANY FALSE ENTRIES.
WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY' HUMANITIES PROGRAMMING FOR THE PUBLIC.

MORGANTOWN PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS 1 OF 10 PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE IN
RADCLIFFE COLLEGE'S WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY PROJECT. A WEEK-LONG TRAINING
SESSION INCLUDED DISCUSSION OF HOW NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WOMEN IS CHANGING THE
PERCEPTION OF HISTORY AND OTHER ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES. THERE WERE SESSIONS ON
PROGRAMME PLANNING, OUTREACH, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND FORMATS, AND MORGANTOWN
WILL PLAN AND IMPLEMENT A SERIES OF 4-6 PROGRAMMES ON WOMEN IN SPRING AND
EARLY SUMMER 82. INCLUDED IN PROVISIONAL PLANS ARE A PHOTOGRAPHIC EXHIBITION,
ORAL HISTORY AND REMINISCENCES OF WOMEN FOCUSING ON WAR FROM THE CIVIL WAR TO
MODERN TIMES. PROGRAMMES WILL DRAW ON THE MANY FORMS OF ARCHIVAL MATERIAL
AVAILABLE IN THE AREA.

CUSTOMERS AND FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION SERVICES; THE LONG TERM REQUIREMENTS OF
THE INTEGRATED OFFICE; AND A PREVIEW OF NEW AND SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTS THAT WILL
BE ON VIEW AT THE COMMUNICATIONS 82 EXHIBITION.
OUTLINE OF A SOCIETY OF FREELY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

TODAY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN MANY FIELDS CAUSE SOCIAL CHANGES ALMOST
BEFORE SOCIETY HAS BECOME AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. VERY OFTEN NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES OF CERTAIN INNOVATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED
BEFOREHAND. THIS HAS LED TO THE GROWTH OF MANY COUNTER MOVEMENTS IN SOCIETY.
IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF 'ESTABLISHED'
AND 'ALTERNATIVE' STYLES OF LIVING, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF
INNOVATION IN SOCIETY. INITIATIVE, CREATIVITY AND COOPERATION, THE VITAL
FACTORS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC INNOVATION, ARE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS,
ONLY OPINIONS AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF EMPLOYING THEM DIFFER. TODAY A NEW
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION NETWORK IS GRADUALLY LINKING MANKIND. THE WORLD IS
BECOMING A 'GLOBAL VILLAGE' AT LEAST ON THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL
COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURES. THIS NETWORK MAY ENABLE US TO PROGRESS TO A
RATIONAL WORLD MODEL IN WHICH EVERYONE WILL HAVE A CHANCE IN  LIFE.
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT.

THE CURRICULUM MUST REFLECT THE EDUCATIONAL MILIEU, AND RESPOND TO IT.
ACCORDINGLY CONSIDERS IN TURN THE RELEVANCE OF SOCIAL FACTORS, THE PROCESS OF
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, THE NATURE OF LEARNING, AND THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE,
SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF EACH OF THESE. ONLY AFTER SUCH AN ANALYSIS IS IT
POSSIBLE TO FORM A VIABLE CURRICULUM.

A PROGRAMME OF ACTION PREPARED BY UNESCO FOR THE 1982 WORLD CONGRESS OF BOOKS,
PROPOSING STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE READING HABITS WORLDWIDE. A PRELIMINARY SURVEY
OF THE PRESENT SITUATION IS PRESENTED, AND THE SUCCESS OF UNESCO ACTIVITIES TO
DATE REVIEWED. THE NATIONAL GOALS PROPOSED FOR THE 80S ARE' FORMULATION OF
NATIONAL BOOK STRATEGY BY SPECIALISED COMMITTEE, RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPILING
DATA TO IDENTIFY NATIONAL NEEDS, WITH LEGAL BACKING TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION;
INTEGRATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO THE BOOK INDUSTRY; PROMOTION OF THE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY BY ENCOURAGING AUTHORS, ENSURING ADEQUATE RESOURCES, AND
CREATING THE APPROPRIATE WORK FORCE; AND CREATION OF A MILIEU WHERE ALL LEVELS
OF READERS HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL OF THEIR CHOICE. EACH GOAL IS DISCUSSED AT
LENGTH, EMPHASISING THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES SUITABLE FOR INDUSTRIALISED AND
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

IN AFRICA WAS AWARDED TO F. ADI FOR 2HEALTH EDUCATION FOR THE COMMUNITY1.
MAJOR AND MINOR PUBLISHERS FROM AFRICA, USA, UK AND CHINA WERE REPRESENTED.
ORGANISATIONAL DIFFICULTIES PREVENTED 'TEACH-INS' TAKING PLACE, AND BOOKED
SPEAKERS DID NOT APPEAR, WITH THE RESULT THAT IMPROMPTU SPEAKERS ATTEMPTED NO
NEW ANALYSIS OF NIGERIAN AND GENERAL AFRICAN PUBLISHING PROBLEMS.
THE FESTIVAL OF BOOKS AND BOOK FAIR IN SINGAPORE' A UNIQUE EXPERIMENT IN BOOK
PROMOTION.

THE FESTIVAL OF BOOKS AND BOOK FAIR, 1980, WAS HELD AT THE VICTORIA MEMORIAL
HALL, SINGAPORE. IT HAD THE DUAL FEATURES OF A BOOK FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTED BY A
WIDE RANGE OF BOOK-ORIENTATED PROGRAMMES AND A BOOK FAIR IN WHICH A WIDE RANGE
OF LOCALLY AVAILABLE BOOKS WAS DISPLAYED. ITS MAIN AIM, RATHER THAN TO PROVIDE
A FORUM FOR TRADE, WAS TO PROMOTE BOOKS AND READING. DESCRIBES ITS
ORGANISATION, PLANNING, PUBLICITY, AND THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE
WORK OF THE FESTIVAL.
BECOMING LITERATE.

FINAL REPORT OF A RESEARCH PROJECT 'ADULT ILLITERACY AND THE SOCIALIZATION OF
ADULT ILLITERATES'. THE STUDY TRIED TO DISCOVER, THROUGH INTERVIEWING A RANDOM
SAMPLE OF ADULT LITERACY STUDENTS AND THEIR TUTORS IN THE NOTTINGHAM AREA, THE
HISTORY OF THEIR READING/WRITING DIFFICULTIES, THE IMPACT OF THESE
DIFFICULTIES ON THEIR CAREERS AT SCHOOL, DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL LIFE AND ANY
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ILLITERACY AND ANY OTHER HANDICAP OR DEPRIVATION.
READ TO THEM.

FEW PARENTS REGULARLY READ STORIES ALOUD TO THEIR CHILDREN. THE AFFECTIONATE
ATMOSPHERE GIVEN BY READING A STORY IS REASSURING AND SECURITY-BUILDING AT ANY
AGE. IT IS A MISTAKE TO DISCONTINUE THE PRACTICE. THE CHILD LEARNS LANGUAGE,
AND ABOUT THE WRITTEN WORD THROUGH THIS. READING TO HIM CAN HELP HIM TO
UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS HE CANNOT GRASP BY READING TO HIMSELF. LITERATURE WITH
HUMOUR, INSIGHT AND MATURITY NEEDS TO BE SOUGHT. CHILDREN FROM LITERARY RATHER
THAN GIFTED BACKGROUNDS ARE THE BEST READERS.
STUDY OF RECREATIONAL READING IN THE FIRST GRADE MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS IN BELO
HORIZONTE, BRAZIL.

REPORT BASED ON A POSTGRADUATE THESIS, PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,
BRAZIL. THE READING HABITS OF A 5% SAMPLE OF PUPILS WERE INVESTIGATED BY
QUESTIONNAIRE, AND SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM TEACHERS AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT READING IS NOT A POPULAR LEISURE ACTIVITY, AND
THAT NEITHER TEACHERS NOR LIBRARIANS ARE AS ACTIVE AS THEY MIGHT BE IN
STIMULATING INTEREST IN READING. THE NECESSITY FOR FURTHER MORE DETAILED
STUDIES IS EMPHASISED.
ORIGIN OF WRITING.

FOR MANY YEARS SPEECH AND GESTURE WERE MAN'S ONLY FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, AND
WRITING EMERGED AS A MORE EFFECTIVE AND LASTING FORM OF COMMUNICATION IN THE
4TH MILLENIUM B.C. ALTHOUGH ITS ORIGIN IS UNKNOWN, OUR PRESENT ALPHABET IS
DERIVED FROM THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET, AND AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE
MESOPOTAMIANS, SUMERIANS, EGYPTIANS, CHINESE AND OTHERS BEGAN TO DEVELOP FORMS
OF WRITING.
ZIMBABWEAN BIBLIOGRAPHY' RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS.

PART 6 IN A SERIES OF ARTICLES SURVEYING RHODESIAN/ZIMBABWEAN BIBLIOGRAPHY.
EXAMINES 56 BIBLIOGRAPHIES ON A VARIETY OF ASPECTS OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN LIFE
PUBLISHED SINCE THE 5TH ARTICLE IN THE SERIES WAS PUBLISHED IN OCT 77 (2SEE1
79/3136). MOST OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIES COVERED DEAL WITH HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY,
CONTEMPORARY AFFAIRS AND AFRICAN NATIONALISM BUT SCIENTIFIC, RELIGIOUS AND ART
BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. IT APPEARS THAT INITIATIVE IN LOCAL
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CREATIVITY IS PASSING TO THE ACADEMIC AND SPECIALIST WHICH MAY
BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN TO THE LIBRARIAN WHO BELIEVES THAT BEST RESULTS ARE
OBTAINED WHEN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL EXPERTISE IS COMBINED WITH SUBJECT SPECIALIST
KNOWLEDGE.
G.-F. DE BURE'S BIBLIOGRAPHIE INSTRUCTIVE, WITH ANNOTATIONS BY J.-F. NEE DE LA
ROCHELLE.

DESCRIBES A RECENT IMPORTANT ACQUISITION OF THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE AND
DISCUSSES ITS SIGNIFICANCE. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIE INSTRUCTIVE WAS 1ST PUBLISHED IN
1584 AS A HANDBOOK FOR COLLECTORS. A BRIEF ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE AUTHOR AND
HIS WORK. NEE DE LA ROCHELLE, A LATE 18TH CENTURY SCHOLAR AND DILETTANTE, USED
HIS COPY AS AN EVERYDAY TOOL. THE VARIOUS TYPES OF NOTES ARE DESCRIBED, AND
THEIR IMPORTANCE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO FORMAT, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES,
CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES, POINTS OF LEARNING, AND THE HISTORY OF THE PRINTED
BOOK, AS EVIDENCE FOR THE STUDY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY ON THE EVE OF THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION.

IFLA CONFERENCES.

IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE 46TH AND 47TH IFLA CONFERENCES THE SECTION ON
BIBLIOGRAPHY CONTINUED ITS WORK ON THE PROBLEMS OF IMPROVEMENT OF NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL ACCORDING TO PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED PLANS. THE WORK
COMPLETED BY THE WORKING GROUP ON CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES IS REVIEWED.
THE TASKS OF A NEW WORKING GROUP ON THE 2BIBLIOGRAPHY OF IFLA CONFERENCE
PAPERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS 1ARE COVERED. PAPERS GIVEN AT SECTION MEETINGS AT
THE 46TH AND 47TH IFLA CONFERENCES ARE LISTED.
THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SITUATION AND THE NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE, (PART) 1'
UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE LIBRARY CENTRE.

IN 1954, A BIBLIOGRAPHIC JOINT COMMITTEE WAS SET UP, WHOSE TASK WAS TO
COORDINATE DANISH BIBLIOGRAPHIC PUBLISHING AND INITIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHERE
NEEDED. IT WAS TO ADVISE THE LIBRARY CENTRE THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LONG TERM
PLANNING. IN REALITY, CONTROL WAS LEFT TO THE PUBLISHERS AND INITIATIVES FOR
NEW PUBLICATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS, INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND PRESSURE GROUPS.
THIS SITUATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE UNTIL THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL
FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUNCIL WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR
CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND STATE FINANCING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
AS LONG AS THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS MONOPOLY ON PRODUCTION, IT CAN DICTATE THAT
LIBRARIES MUST PAY HIGH PRICES OR ELSE MAKE DO WITH FEWER AND INFERIOR
BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS THEREFORE CALLED FOR NATIONALISATION
OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH FREE DISTRIBU TION TO LIBRARIES.
PROBLEMS IN ISSUING BRAZILIAN CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY.

DISCUSSES THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS
FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY-EDITORIAL AGREEMENT AND COMPULSORY
LEGAL DEPOSIT. TAKING AS CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION, EXHAUSTIVITY, REGULARITY AND
ACCURACY, EXAMINES 12 CURRENT AND RECENT PUBLICATIONS ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE
BIBLIOGRAPHIC COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY'S
BIBLIOGRAPHIC BULLETIN, AND A NUMBER OF PRODUCTIONS FROM COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS
AND INSTITUTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT UNTIL LEGAL DEPOSIT IS ENFORCED AND THE
NATIONAL LIBRARY BULLETIN ISSUED ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY
WILL REMAIN INADEQUATE.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON EMBARKS ON FESTSCHRIFTEN PROJECT.

CENSORSHIP IN COLORADO.

SINCE JULY 81, COLORADO HAS HAD 2 CENSORSHIP STATUTES. THE 1ST, SENATE BILL
38, BROADLY ESTABLISHES FOR THE ADULT POPULATION WHAT IS OBSCENE-WHAT MAY BE
READ, SEEN OR HEARD. THE 2ND, THE RESULT OF HOUSE BILL 1310, STATES THAT NO
MATERIAL 'HARMFUL TO CHILDREN' MAY BE LOCATED WHERE CHILDREN MIGHT READ, AND
THUS EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITS ADULTS FROM THE SAME MATERIAL UNLESS BOOKSTORES BAR
ADMITTANCE TO UNDER-18S. DESPITE THE US CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS,
GUARANTEEING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ONSLAUGHT OF PEOPLE
CHIPPING AWAY AT THIS SOCIAL FOUNDATION. QUESTIONS THE REASONS WHY THIS SHOULD
OCCUR, AND DESCRIBES THE BOOKSELLERS' AND LIBRARIANS' ROLES IN RELATION TO THE
WOULD-BE CENSOR.
PUBLISHING ACTIVITY IN THE UNIVERSITY.

RESULTING IN AN INCREASINGLY HEALTHY JOURNAL THAT DISSEMINATES DATA AND IDEAS.
THE JOURNAL IN THE YEAR 2000.

DISCUSSES DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND THEIR POSSIBLE
EFFECT ON PRINTING AND PUBLISHING OF PERIDOICALS. PREDICTS THAT THE BASIC UNIT
OF PUBLICATION WILL BE THE ARTICLE RATHER THAN THE JOURNAL, WHICH MAY BE
PRINTED ON DEMAND BY COMPUTER TERMINALS. IN THE LONG TERM LIBRARIES CAN BE
EXPECTED TO CONCENTRATE PRIMARILY ON UNIQUE MATERIALS AND TO BEAR A CLOSER
RESEMBLANCE TO ARCHIVES.

THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL' CURRENT TRENDS AND PROSPECTS.

THE PRIMARY JOURNAL HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT FORMAL MEDIUM FOR THE
DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION FOR OVER 3 CENTURIES. A NUMBER OF
CRITICISMS CAN BE LEVELLED AGAINST IT VIZ. THE PUBLICATION PROCESS IS TIME
CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE WHILE JOURNAL PROLIFERATION ENSURES THE SCATTERING OF
RELATED INFORMATION. RECENT INNOVATIONS SUCH AS COMPUTER-AIDED PRODUCTION,
MICROFORM PUBLICATION AND LETTER AND SYNOPSIS JOURNALS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO
OVERCOME THESE DRAWBACKS. ALTERNATIVES TO THE TRADITIONAL JOURNAL SUCH AS THE
COMPUTER-BASED EDITORIAL PROCESSING CENTRE AND THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL HAVE
BEEN MOOTED AND ARE CONSIDERED VIABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY
THAT THEY WILL BE RESISTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

CONSUMPTION IN 1ST AND 3RD WORLD COUNTRIES. THE TENDENCY APPEARS NOW TO BE
TOWARDS 2 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOOKS, 1 FOR THE ELITE AND THE OTHER FOR THE
MASSES. IN CONCLUSION THE NECESSITY FOR CONCERTED ACTION TO ENSURE THE FUTURE
OF THE BOOK IS URGED.
